However, some existing\nICP-based methods do not consider the reliability of the initial pose, which\nmay cause the method to converge to a local optimum. Furthermore, the absence\nof an adaptive mechanism hinders the effective handling of complex dynamic\nenvironments, resulting in a significant degradation of registration accuracy.\nTo address these issues, this paper proposes an adaptive ICP-based LiDAR\nodometry method that relies on a reliable initial pose.

To address this issue, we propose the Dynamic Robust MCTS\n(DyRo-MCTS) approach, which integrates action robustness estimation into MCTS.\nDyRo-MCTS guides the production environment toward states that not only yield\ngood scheduling outcomes but are also easily adaptable to future job arrivals.\nExtensive experiments show that DyRo-MCTS significantly improves the\nperformance of offline-learned policies with negligible additional online\nplanning time. Moreover, DyRo-MCTS consistently outperforms vanilla MCTS across\nvarious scheduling scenarios. Further analysis reveals that its ability to make\nrobust scheduling decisions leads to long-term, sustainable performance gains\nunder disturbances."}

While recent approaches successfully learn\nclosed-loop grasping policies using reinforcement learning (RL), the inherent\ndifficulty of high-dimensional, long-horizon exploration necessitates complex\nreward and curriculum design, often resulting in suboptimal solutions across\ndiverse objects. We propose DemoGrasp, a simple yet effective method for\nlearning universal dexterous grasping. We start from a single successful\ndemonstration trajectory of grasping a specific object and adapt to novel\nobjects and poses by editing the robot actions in this trajectory: changing the\nwrist pose determines where to grasp, and changing the hand joint angles\ndetermines how to grasp. We formulate this trajectory editing as a single-step\nMarkov Decision Process (MDP) and use RL to optimize a universal policy across\nhundreds of objects in parallel in simulation, with a simple reward consisting\nof a binary success term and a robot-table collision penalty. In simulation,\nDemoGrasp achieves a 95% success rate on DexGraspNet objects using the Shadow\nHand, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods.

To address this, we present\nA2R, an Asymmetric Two-Stage Reasoning framework designed to explicitly bridge\nthe gap between a model's potential and its actual performance.

Subsequently,a \"synthesizer\" model integrates these\nreferences for a more refined, second stage of reasoning.

We ask that can we interpret the ranking results, so as to\nassess the retrieval models and examine the text-video data? This work proposes\nX-CoT, an explainable retrieval framework upon LLM CoT reasoning in place of\nthe embedding model-based similarity ranking. We first expand the existing\nbenchmarks with additional video annotations to support semantic understanding\nand reduce data bias. We also devise a retrieval CoT consisting of pairwise\ncomparison steps, yielding detailed reasoning and complete ranking. X-CoT\nempirically improves the retrieval performance and produces detailed\nrationales. It also facilitates the model behavior and data quality analysis.\nCode and data are available at: https://github.com/PrasannaPulakurthi/X-CoT."}

To\novercome this bottleneck, we propose Embodied Manipulation Media Adaptation\n(EMMA), a VLA policy enhancement framework that integrates a generative data\nengine with an effective training pipeline. We introduce DreamTransfer, a\ndiffusion Transformer-based framework for generating multi-view consistent,\ngeometrically grounded embodied manipulation videos. DreamTransfer enables\ntext-controlled visual editing of robot videos, transforming foreground,\nbackground, and lighting conditions without compromising 3D structure or\ngeometrical plausibility. Furthermore, we explore hybrid training with real and\ngenerated data, and introduce AdaMix, a hard-sample-aware training strategy\nthat dynamically reweights training batches to focus optimization on\nperceptually or kinematically challenging samples. Extensive experiments show\nthat videos generated by DreamTransfer significantly outperform prior video\ngeneration methods in multi-view consistency, geometric fidelity, and\ntext-conditioning accuracy.

This structure can be conceptualized as the embodiment of the\neffective thinking paths that the model has learned to successfully solve a\ngiven task. Based on this concept, we build REMA, a framework that explains the\norigins of failures by quantitatively comparing the spatial relationships of\ninternal model representations corresponding to both erroneous and correct\nreasoning samples.

This type of method suffers from\nspatial information loss, computational redundancy, and memory bloat, which\nimpede efficient navigation. Inspired by the implicit scene representation in\nhuman navigation, analogous to the left brain's semantic understanding and the\nright brain's spatial cognition, we propose JanusVLN, a novel VLN framework\nfeaturing a dual implicit neural memory that models spatial-geometric and\nvisual-semantic memory as separate, compact, and fixed-size neural\nrepresentations. This framework first extends the MLLM to incorporate 3D prior\nknowledge from the spatial-geometric encoder, thereby enhancing the spatial\nreasoning capabilities of models based solely on RGB input. Then, the\nhistorical key-value caches from the spatial-geometric and visual-semantic\nencoders are constructed into a dual implicit memory. By retaining only the KVs\nof tokens in the initial and sliding window, redundant computation is avoided,\nenabling efficient incremental updates.

To answer this, we propose UniVid, a\nframework that fine-tunes a video diffusion transformer to handle various\nvision tasks without task-specific modifications. Tasks are represented as\nvisual sentences, where the context sequence defines both the task and the\nexpected output modality.

These tasks involve extended action sequences and complex object\ninteractions, presenting a critical gap between high-level symbolic planning\nand low-level continuous control. To bridge this gap, two essential\ncapabilities are required: robust long-horizon task planning and effective\ngoal-conditioned manipulation. Existing task planning methods, including\ntraditional and LLM-based approaches, often exhibit limited generalization or\nsparse semantic reasoning. Meanwhile, image-conditioned control methods\nstruggle to adapt to unseen tasks. To tackle these problems, we propose SAGE, a\nnovel framework for Scene Graph-Aware Guidance and Execution in Long-Horizon\nManipulation Tasks. SAGE utilizes semantic scene graphs as a structural\nrepresentation for scene states. A structural scene graph enables bridging\ntask-level semantic reasoning and pixel-level visuo-motor control. This also\nfacilitates the controllable synthesis of accurate, novel sub-goal images. SAGE\nconsists of two key components: (1) a scene graph-based task planner that uses\nVLMs and LLMs to parse the environment and reason about physically-grounded\nscene state transition sequences, and (2) a decoupled structural image editing\npipeline that controllably converts each target sub-goal graph into a\ncorresponding image through image inpainting and composition. Extensive\nexperiments have demonstrated that SAGE achieves state-of-the-art performance\non distinct long-horizon tasks."}

Based on the principle\nof implicit learning, speech-language therapists (SLTs) typically embed target\nmorphological structures (e.g., third person -s) into everyday interactions or\ngame-based learning activities. Educators are recommended by SLTs to do the\nsame. This approach demands precise linguistic knowledge and real-time\nproduction of various morphological forms (e.g., \"Daddy wears these when he\ndrives to work\"). The task becomes even more demanding when educators or parent\nalso must keep children engaged and manage turn-taking in a game-based\nactivity. In the TalBot project our multiprofessional team have developed an\napplication in which the Furhat conversational robot plays the word retrieval\ngame \"Alias\" with children to improve language skills. Our application\ncurrently employs a large language model (LLM) to manage gameplay, dialogue,\naffective responses, and turn-taking. Our next step is to further leverage the\ncapacity of LLMs so the robot can generate and deliver specific morphological\ntargets during the game. We hypothesize that a robot could outperform humans at\nthis task. Novel aspects of this approach are that the robot could ultimately\nserve as a model and tutor for both children and professionals and that using\nLLM capabilities in this context would support basic communication needs for\nchildren with language vulnerabilities. Our long-term goal is to create a\nrobust LLM-based Robot-Assisted Language Learning intervention capable of\nteaching a variety of morphological structures across different languages."}

While recent\nstudies have explored vulnerabilities in models like LLMs, VLMs, and\nText-to-Image (T2I) models through jailbreak attacks, T2V models remain largely\nunexplored, leaving a significant safety gap. To address this gap, we introduce\nSceneSplit, a novel black-box jailbreak method that works by fragmenting a\nharmful narrative into multiple scenes, each individually benign. This approach\nmanipulates the generative output space, the abstract set of all potential\nvideo outputs for a given prompt, using the combination of scenes as a powerful\nconstraint to guide the final outcome. While each scene individually\ncorresponds to a wide and safe space where most outcomes are benign, their\nsequential combination collectively restricts this space, narrowing it to an\nunsafe region and significantly increasing the likelihood of generating a\nharmful video. This core mechanism is further enhanced through iterative scene\nmanipulation, which bypasses the safety filter within this constrained unsafe\nregion. Additionally, a strategy library that reuses successful attack patterns\nfurther improves the attack's overall effectiveness and robustness. To validate\nour method, we evaluate SceneSplit across 11 safety categories on T2V models.\nOur results show that it achieves a high average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of\n77.2% on Luma Ray2, 84.1% on Hailuo, and 78.2% on Veo2, significantly\noutperforming the existing baseline.

We explore 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) as an alternative\nvisual substrate for alignment: a compact, spatially adaptive representation\nthat parameterizes images by a set of colored anisotropic Gaussians. We develop\na scalable 2DGS pipeline with structured initialization, luminance aware\npruning, and batched CUDA kernels, achieving over 90x faster fitting and about\n97% GPU utilization compared to prior implementations.

While recent\nstudies have explored vulnerabilities in models like LLMs, VLMs, and\nText-to-Image (T2I) models through jailbreak attacks, T2V models remain largely\nunexplored, leaving a significant safety gap. To address this gap, we introduce\nSceneSplit, a novel black-box jailbreak method that works by fragmenting a\nharmful narrative into multiple scenes, each individually benign. This approach\nmanipulates the generative output space, the abstract set of all potential\nvideo outputs for a given prompt, using the combination of scenes as a powerful\nconstraint to guide the final outcome. While each scene individually\ncorresponds to a wide and safe space where most outcomes are benign, their\nsequential combination collectively restricts this space, narrowing it to an\nunsafe region and significantly increasing the likelihood of generating a\nharmful video. This core mechanism is further enhanced through iterative scene\nmanipulation, which bypasses the safety filter within this constrained unsafe\nregion. Additionally, a strategy library that reuses successful attack patterns\nfurther improves the attack's overall effectiveness and robustness. To validate\nour method, we evaluate SceneSplit across 11 safety categories on T2V models.\nOur results show that it achieves a high average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of\n77.2% on Luma Ray2, 84.1% on Hailuo, and 78.2% on Veo2, significantly\noutperforming the existing baseline.

Project page: https://spf-web.pages.dev", "summary": "We present See, Point, Fly (SPF), a training-free aerial vision-and-language\nnavigation (AVLN) framework built atop vision-language models (VLMs). SPF is\ncapable of navigating to any goal based on any type of free-form instructions\nin any kind of environment. In contrast to existing VLM-based approaches that\ntreat action prediction as a text generation task, our key insight is to\nconsider action prediction for AVLN as a 2D spatial grounding task. SPF\nharnesses VLMs to decompose vague language instructions into iterative\nannotation of 2D waypoints on the input image. Along with the predicted\ntraveling distance, SPF transforms predicted 2D waypoints into 3D displacement\nvectors as action commands for UAVs. Moreover, SPF also adaptively adjusts the\ntraveling distance to facilitate more efficient navigation. Notably, SPF\nperforms navigation in a closed-loop control manner, enabling UAVs to follow\ndynamic targets in dynamic environments. SPF sets a new state of the art in DRL\nsimulation benchmark, outperforming the previous best method by an absolute\nmargin of 63%. In extensive real-world evaluations, SPF outperforms strong\nbaselines by a large margin. We also conduct comprehensive ablation studies to\nhighlight the effectiveness of our design choice. Lastly, SPF shows remarkable\ngeneralization to different VLMs. Project page: https://spf-web.pages.dev"}
