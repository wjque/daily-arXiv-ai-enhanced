We therefore propose scaling along the temperature\ndimension, which enlarges the reasoning boundary of LLMs. Averaged over Qwen3\n(0.6B, 1.7B, 4B, 8B) and five representative reasoning benchmarks (AIME\n2024/2025, MATH500, LiveCodeBench, Hi-ToM), temperature scaling yields an\nadditional 7.3 points over single-temperature TTS.

Recently, radar technologies, such as ultra-wideband (UWB) have\nemerged as potential alternatives due to their ability to see through adverse\nenvironmental conditions (e.g. dust, smoke and rain). However, due to the small\napertures with low directivity, the UWB radars cannot reconstruct a detailed\nimage of its field of view (FOV) using a single scan. Hence, a virtual large\naperture is synthesized by moving the radar along a mobile robot path. The\nresulting synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image is a high-definition\nrepresentation of the surrounding environment. Hence, this paper proposes a\npipeline for mobile robots to incorporate UWB radar-based SAR imaging to map an\nunknown environment. Finally, we evaluated the performance of classical feature\ndetectors: SIFT, SURF, BRISK, AKAZE and ORB to identify loop closures using UWB\nSAR images.

We integrate\nthe modality tokens into the detection process via Multimodality Context\nAttention (MoCA), mixing object-query representations via self-attention to\npropagate modality context within the query set. This preserves DETR-style\narchitectures and adds negligible latency while injecting modality cues into\nobject queries. We further introduce QueryREPA, a short pretraining stage that\naligns query representations to their modality tokens using a task-specific\ncontrastive objective with modality-balanced batches. Together, MoCA and\nQueryREPA produce modality-aware, class-faithful queries that transfer\neffectively to downstream training. Across diverse modalities trained\naltogether, the proposed approach consistently improves AP with minimal\noverhead and no architectural modifications, offering a practical path toward\nrobust multimodality medical object detection.

While there are some theoretical and primary\nempirical results showing the advantages of latent reasoning with looped\ntransformers or continuous chain-of-thoughts, continuous diffusion models\ntypically underperform their discrete counterparts. In this paper, we argue\nthat diffusion language models do not necessarily need to be in the discrete\nspace. In particular, we prove that continuous diffusion models have stronger\nexpressivity than discrete diffusions and looped transformers. We attribute the\ncontradiction between the theoretical expressiveness and empirical performance\nto their practical trainability: while continuous diffusion provides\nintermediate supervision that looped transformers lack, they introduce\nadditional difficulty decoding tokens into the discrete token space from the\ncontinuous representation space. We therefore propose Coevolutionary Continuous\nDiscrete Diffusion (CCDD), which defines a joint multimodal diffusion process\non the union of a continuous representation space and a discrete token space,\nleveraging a single model to simultaneously denoise in the joint space. By\ncombining two modalities, CCDD is expressive with rich semantics in the latent\nspace, as well as good trainability and sample quality with the help of\nexplicit discrete tokens. We also propose effective architectures and advanced\ntraining/sampling techniques for CCDD, which reveals strong empirical\nperformance in extensive language modeling experiments on real-world tasks."}

Project page:\n  https://bb12346.github.io/GeoComplete/", "summary": "Reference-driven image completion, which restores missing regions in a target\nview using additional images, is particularly challenging when the target view\ndiffers significantly from the references. Existing generative methods rely\nsolely on diffusion priors and, without geometric cues such as camera pose or\ndepth, often produce misaligned or implausible content. We propose GeoComplete,\na novel framework that incorporates explicit 3D structural guidance to enforce\ngeometric consistency in the completed regions, setting it apart from prior\nimage-only approaches. GeoComplete introduces two key ideas: conditioning the\ndiffusion process on projected point clouds to infuse geometric information,\nand applying target-aware masking to guide the model toward relevant reference\ncues. The framework features a dual-branch diffusion architecture. One branch\nsynthesizes the missing regions from the masked target, while the other\nextracts geometric features from the projected point cloud. Joint\nself-attention across branches ensures coherent and accurate completion. To\naddress regions visible in references but absent in the target, we project the\ntarget view into each reference to detect occluded areas, which are then masked\nduring training. This target-aware masking directs the model to focus on useful\ncues, enhancing performance in difficult scenarios. By integrating a\ngeometry-aware dual-branch diffusion architecture with a target-aware masking\nstrategy, GeoComplete offers a unified and robust solution for\ngeometry-conditioned image completion. Experiments show that GeoComplete\nachieves a 17.1 PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods, significantly\nboosting geometric accuracy while maintaining high visual quality."}

Building on these findings, we propose REACT-Drive, a trajectory\nplanning framework that integrates VLMs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG). Specifically, REACT-Drive leverages VLMs to convert prior failure cases\ninto constraint rules and executable trajectory planning code, while RAG\nretrieves similar patterns in new scenarios to guide trajectory generation.\nExperimental results on the ROADWork dataset show that REACT-Drive yields a\nreduction of around $3\\times$ in average displacement error relative to VLM\nbaselines under evaluation with Qwen2.5-VL. In addition, REACT-Drive yields the\nlowest inference time ($0.58$s) compared with other methods such as fine-tuning\n($17.90$s). We further conduct experiments using a real vehicle in 15 work zone\nscenarios in the physical world, demonstrating the strong practicality of\nREACT-Drive."}

However,\noptical information of visual observations is difficult to be explicitly\nmodeled like LiDAR point clouds or depth maps, which subsequently requires\nintelligent models and large-scale data. To this end, we propose to leverage\nthe intelligence of the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model to learn diverse\nnavigation capabilities from synthetic expert data in a teacher-student manner.\nSpecifically, we implement the VLA model, MM-Nav, as a multi-view VLA (with 360\nobservations) based on pretrained large language models and visual foundation\nmodels. For large-scale navigation data, we collect expert data from three\nreinforcement learning (RL) experts trained with privileged depth information\nin three challenging tailor-made environments for different navigation\ncapabilities: reaching, squeezing, and avoiding. We iteratively train our VLA\nmodel using data collected online from RL experts, where the training ratio is\ndynamically balanced based on performance on individual capabilities. Through\nextensive experiments in synthetic environments, we demonstrate that our model\nachieves strong generalization capability. Moreover, we find that our student\nVLA model outperforms the RL teachers, demonstrating the synergistic effect of\nintegrating multiple capabilities. Extensive real-world experiments further\nconfirm the effectiveness of our method."}
