### [2] [Oracle-RLAIF: An Improved Fine-Tuning Framework for Multi-modal Video Models through Reinforcement Learning from Ranking Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02561)
*Derek Shi,Ruben Glatt,Christine Klymko,Shubham Mohole,Hongjun Choi,Shashank Kushwaha,Sam Sakla,Felipe Leno da Silva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Oracle-RLAIF框架，用通用Oracle排序器替代专门的奖励模型，结合基于排名的GRPO_rank损失函数，实现更高效的多模态视频模型对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视频语言模型参数规模扩大，收集人类反馈的成本增加。现有RLAIF框架依赖专门的奖励模型，训练成本高且限制性强。

Method: 使用Oracle排序器对候选模型响应进行排序而非打分，提出基于GRPO的GRPO_rank排名损失函数，直接优化序数反馈。

Result: Oracle-RLAIF在多个视频理解基准测试中持续优于现有微调方法的主流视频语言模型。

Conclusion: Oracle-RLAIF为使用排名而非分数的强化学习对齐大型多模态视频模型开辟了灵活且数据高效的路径。

Abstract: Recent advances in large video-language models (VLMs) rely on extensive
fine-tuning techniques that strengthen alignment between textual and visual
comprehension. Leading pipelines typically pair supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
with reinforcement learning from preference data to enhance video
comprehension. However, as VLMs scale in parameter size, so does the cost of
gathering enough human feedback. To make fine-tuning more cost-effective,
recent frameworks explore reinforcement learning with AI feedback (RLAIF),
which replace human preference with AI as a judge. Current RLAIF frameworks
rely on a specialized reward model trained with video narratives to create
calibrated scalar rewards-- an expensive and restrictive pipeline. We propose
Oracle-RLAIF, a novel framework that replaces the trained reward model with a
more general Oracle ranker which acts as a drop-in model ranking candidate
model responses rather than scoring them. Alongside Oracle-RLAIF, we introduce
$GRPO_{rank}$, a novel rank-based loss function based on Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) that directly optimizes ordinal feedback with rank-aware
advantages. Empirically, we demonstrate that Oracle-RLAIF consistently
outperforms leading VLMs using existing fine-tuning methods when evaluated
across various video comprehension benchmarks. Oracle-RLAIF paves the path to
creating flexible and data-efficient frameworks for aligning large multi-modal
video models with reinforcement learning from rank rather than score.

Conclusion: 该方法通过统一的视觉到动作学习框架，实现了物理基础和视觉对齐的运动重建，克服了传统两阶段方法的局限性。

Abstract: Reconstructing physically plausible human motion from monocular videos
remains a challenging problem in computer vision and graphics. Existing methods
primarily focus on kinematics-based pose estimation, often leading to
unrealistic results due to the lack of physical constraints. To address such
artifacts, prior methods have typically relied on physics-based post-processing
following the initial kinematics-based motion estimation. However, this
two-stage design introduces error accumulation, ultimately limiting the overall
reconstruction quality. In this paper, we present PhysHMR, a unified framework
that directly learns a visual-to-action policy for humanoid control in a
physics-based simulator, enabling motion reconstruction that is both physically
grounded and visually aligned with the input video. A key component of our
approach is the pixel-as-ray strategy, which lifts 2D keypoints into 3D spatial
rays and transforms them into global space. These rays are incorporated as
policy inputs, providing robust global pose guidance without depending on noisy
3D root predictions. This soft global grounding, combined with local visual
features from a pretrained encoder, allows the policy to reason over both
detailed pose and global positioning. To overcome the sample inefficiency of
reinforcement learning, we further introduce a distillation scheme that
transfers motion knowledge from a mocap-trained expert to the
vision-conditioned policy, which is then refined using physically motivated
reinforcement learning rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhysHMR
produces high-fidelity, physically plausible motion across diverse scenarios,
outperforming prior approaches in both visual accuracy and physical realism.

Conclusion: 人机协作在人脸识别中具有重要作用，智能人机融合能有效提高系统准确性并最小化低性能人类的影响，为AI在人脸识别中的智能使用提供了基于证据的路线图。

Abstract: Human review of consequential decisions by face recognition algorithms
creates a "collaborative" human-machine system. Individual differences between
people and machines, however, affect whether collaboration improves or degrades
accuracy in any given case. We establish the circumstances under which
combining human and machine face identification decisions improves accuracy.
Using data from expert and non-expert face identifiers, we examined the
benefits of human-human and human-machine collaborations. The benefits of
collaboration increased as the difference in baseline accuracy between
collaborators decreased-following the Proximal Accuracy Rule (PAR). This rule
predicted collaborative (fusion) benefit across a wide range of baseline
abilities, from people with no training to those with extensive training. Using
the PAR, we established a critical fusion zone, where humans are less accurate
than the machine, but fusing the two improves system accuracy. This zone was
surprisingly large. We implemented "intelligent human-machine fusion" by
selecting people with the potential to increase the accuracy of a
high-performing machine. Intelligent fusion was more accurate than the machine
operating alone and more accurate than combining all human and machine
judgments. The highest system-wide accuracy achievable with human-only
partnerships was found by graph theory. This fully human system approximated
the average performance achieved by intelligent human-machine collaboration.
However, intelligent human-machine collaboration more effectively minimized the
impact of low-performing humans on system-wide accuracy. The results
demonstrate a meaningful role for both humans and machines in assuring accurate
face identification. This study offers an evidence-based road map for the
intelligent use of AI in face identification.

### [5] [FSFSplatter: Build Surface and Novel Views with Sparse-Views within 3min](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02691)
*Yibin Zhao,Yihan Pan,Jun Nan,Jianjun Yi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FSFSplatter是一种从自由稀疏图像进行快速表面重建的新方法，通过集成端到端密集高斯初始化、相机参数估计和几何增强场景优化，解决了现有方法需要密集校准视图的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高斯泼溅方法大多需要密集校准视图，从自由稀疏图像重建时由于有限重叠和过拟合会导致表面质量差。

Method: 使用大型Transformer编码多视图图像，通过自分裂高斯头生成密集几何一致的高斯场景初始化，采用贡献度剪枝消除局部漂浮物，利用深度和多视图特征监督结合可微分相机参数缓解过拟合。

Result: FSFSplatter在广泛使用的DTU和Replica数据集上超越了当前最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够从自由稀疏图像实现高质量的表面重建，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has become a leading reconstruction technique, known for
its high-quality novel view synthesis and detailed reconstruction. However,
most existing methods require dense, calibrated views. Reconstructing from free
sparse images often leads to poor surface due to limited overlap and
overfitting. We introduce FSFSplatter, a new approach for fast surface
reconstruction from free sparse images. Our method integrates end-to-end dense
Gaussian initialization, camera parameter estimation, and geometry-enhanced
scene optimization. Specifically, FSFSplatter employs a large Transformer to
encode multi-view images and generates a dense and geometrically consistent
Gaussian scene initialization via a self-splitting Gaussian head. It eliminates
local floaters through contribution-based pruning and mitigates overfitting to
limited views by leveraging depth and multi-view feature supervision with
differentiable camera parameters during rapid optimization. FSFSplatter
outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on widely used DTU and Replica.

Method: 基于潜在空间建模，通过稳健秩相关估计评估校准度，提出S-QUBED黑盒方法分解预测不确定性为偶然性和认知性成分。

Result: 实验表明S-QUBED能计算校准的总不确定性估计，与任务准确度负相关，并能有效计算偶然性和认知性成分。

Conclusion: 这是首个视频生成模型不确定性量化工作，提出的框架能有效评估和分解不确定性，为视频模型的安全应用提供重要工具。

Abstract: Generative video models demonstrate impressive text-to-video capabilities,
spurring widespread adoption in many real-world applications. However, like
large language models (LLMs), video generation models tend to hallucinate,
producing plausible videos even when they are factually wrong. Although
uncertainty quantification (UQ) of LLMs has been extensively studied in prior
work, no UQ method for video models exists, raising critical safety concerns.
To our knowledge, this paper represents the first work towards quantifying the
uncertainty of video models. We present a framework for uncertainty
quantification of generative video models, consisting of: (i) a metric for
evaluating the calibration of video models based on robust rank correlation
estimation with no stringent modeling assumptions; (ii) a black-box UQ method
for video models (termed S-QUBED), which leverages latent modeling to
rigorously decompose predictive uncertainty into its aleatoric and epistemic
components; and (iii) a UQ dataset to facilitate benchmarking calibration in
video models. By conditioning the generation task in the latent space, we
disentangle uncertainty arising due to vague task specifications from that
arising from lack of knowledge. Through extensive experiments on benchmark
video datasets, we demonstrate that S-QUBED computes calibrated total
uncertainty estimates that are negatively correlated with the task accuracy and
effectively computes the aleatoric and epistemic constituents.

### [7] [ROGR: Relightable 3D Objects using Generative Relighting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03163)
*Jiapeng Tang,Matthew Lavine,Dor Verbin,Stephan J. Garbin,Matthias Nießner,Ricardo Martin Brualla,Pratul P. Srinivasan,Philipp Henzler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ROGR是一种新颖的可重光照3D重建方法，通过生成式重光照模型从多视角图像重建物体的可重光照3D模型，使用双分支架构的NeRF分别编码一般光照效果和镜面反射。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在任意环境光照下进行重光照时通常需要针对每种光照进行优化或复杂的光传输模拟，效率较低。ROGR旨在实现无需逐光照优化或光传输模拟的高效前馈重光照。

Method: 通过在不同光照环境下采样物体外观创建数据集，训练光照条件化NeRF。采用新颖的双分支架构分别编码一般光照效果和镜面反射，实现任意环境光照下的高效前馈重光照。

Result: 在TensoIR和Stanford-ORB数据集上的评估表明，ROGR在大多数指标上优于现有最先进方法，并在真实世界物体捕获上展示了良好效果。

Conclusion: ROGR提供了一种高效的可重光照3D重建方法，无需逐光照优化即可实现任意环境光照下的高质量重光照效果，在多个数据集上超越了现有技术水平。

Abstract: We introduce ROGR, a novel approach that reconstructs a relightable 3D model
of an object captured from multiple views, driven by a generative relighting
model that simulates the effects of placing the object under novel environment
illuminations. Our method samples the appearance of the object under multiple
lighting environments, creating a dataset that is used to train a
lighting-conditioned Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) that outputs the object's
appearance under any input environmental lighting. The lighting-conditioned
NeRF uses a novel dual-branch architecture to encode the general lighting
effects and specularities separately. The optimized lighting-conditioned NeRF
enables efficient feed-forward relighting under arbitrary environment maps
without requiring per-illumination optimization or light transport simulation.
We evaluate our approach on the established TensoIR and Stanford-ORB datasets,
where it improves upon the state-of-the-art on most metrics, and showcase our
approach on real-world object captures.

### [8] [PEO: Training-Free Aesthetic Quality Enhancement in Pre-Trained Text-to-Image Diffusion Models with Prompt Embedding Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02599)
*Hovhannes Margaryan,Bo Wan,Tinne Tuytelaars*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Prompt Embedding Optimization (PEO)方法，通过优化文本嵌入来提升预训练文本到图像扩散模型的美学质量，无需额外训练且与主干模型无关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决预训练文本到图像扩散模型在简单提示下生成图像美学质量不足的问题，无需重新训练模型或精心设计提示词。

Method: 使用三重目标函数优化文本嵌入：提升生成图像的美学保真度、确保与优化文本嵌入的一致性、通过提示保留项最小化与初始提示的差异。

Result: 定量和定性评估表明，该方法在美学质量上达到或超过了最先进的文本到图像和提示适应方法。

Conclusion: PEO是一种有效且实用的方法，能够显著提升简单提示下生成图像的美学质量，同时保持与原始提示的一致性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to aesthetic quality improvement in
pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models when given a simple prompt. Our
method, dubbed Prompt Embedding Optimization (PEO), leverages a pre-trained
text-to-image diffusion model as a backbone and optimizes the text embedding of
a given simple and uncurated prompt to enhance the visual quality of the
generated image. We achieve this by a tripartite objective function that
improves the aesthetic fidelity of the generated image, ensures adherence to
the optimized text embedding, and minimal divergence from the initial prompt.
The latter is accomplished through a prompt preservation term. Additionally,
PEO is training-free and backbone-independent. Quantitative and qualitative
evaluations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, exceeding or
equating the performance of state-of-the-art text-to-image and prompt
adaptation methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手部跟踪数据集主要在受控实验室环境中采集，限制了环境多样性和模型泛化能力，需要开发能在真实野外条件下工作的系统。

Method: 设计轻量级背戴式捕捉装置，包含8个外中心相机和Meta Quest 3头显提供的2个内中心视角，开发了内外中心跟踪流程来生成准确的3D手部姿态真值。

Result: 构建了包含同步多视角图像和精确3D手部姿态的标注数据集，显著降低了环境真实性与3D标注精度之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在真实野外条件下实现精确的3D手部跟踪，为无约束环境中的手部交互研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Accurate 3D tracking of hands and their interactions with the world in
unconstrained settings remains a significant challenge for egocentric computer
vision. With few exceptions, existing datasets are predominantly captured in
controlled lab setups, limiting environmental diversity and model
generalization. To address this, we introduce a novel marker-less multi-camera
system designed to capture precise 3D hands and objects, which allows for
nearly unconstrained mobility in genuinely in-the-wild conditions. We combine a
lightweight, back-mounted capture rig with eight exocentric cameras, and a
user-worn Meta Quest 3 headset, which contributes two egocentric views. We
design an ego-exo tracking pipeline to generate accurate 3D hand pose ground
truth from this system, and rigorously evaluate its quality. By collecting an
annotated dataset featuring synchronized multi-view images and precise 3D hand
poses, we demonstrate the capability of our approach to significantly reduce
the trade-off between environmental realism and 3D annotation accuracy.

### [10] [Input-Aware Sparse Attention for Real-Time Co-Speech Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02617)
*Beijia Lu,Ziyi Chen,Jing Xiao,Jun-Yan Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的视频蒸馏方法，将多步扩散模型压缩为少步学生模型，通过输入人体姿态条件引导注意力和损失函数，实现实时性能并提升视觉质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的语音驱动视频生成方法由于大量去噪步骤和昂贵注意力机制导致速度缓慢，无法实现实时部署

Method: 使用输入人体姿态关键点对应关系引导注意力到相关区域，提出输入感知稀疏注意力减少冗余计算；引入输入感知蒸馏损失提升唇部同步和手部运动真实性

Result: 方法实现了实时性能，相比最近的音频驱动和输入驱动方法具有更好的视觉质量

Conclusion: 通过输入感知稀疏注意力和蒸馏损失的集成，在保持高质量的同时显著提升了推理效率

Abstract: Diffusion models can synthesize realistic co-speech video from audio for
various applications, such as video creation and virtual agents. However,
existing diffusion-based methods are slow due to numerous denoising steps and
costly attention mechanisms, preventing real-time deployment. In this work, we
distill a many-step diffusion video model into a few-step student model.
Unfortunately, directly applying recent diffusion distillation methods degrades
video quality and falls short of real-time performance. To address these
issues, our new video distillation method leverages input human pose
conditioning for both attention and loss functions. We first propose using
accurate correspondence between input human pose keypoints to guide attention
to relevant regions, such as the speaker's face, hands, and upper body. This
input-aware sparse attention reduces redundant computations and strengthens
temporal correspondences of body parts, improving inference efficiency and
motion coherence. To further enhance visual quality, we introduce an
input-aware distillation loss that improves lip synchronization and hand motion
realism. By integrating our input-aware sparse attention and distillation loss,
our method achieves real-time performance with improved visual quality compared
to recent audio-driven and input-driven methods. We also conduct extensive
experiments showing the effectiveness of our algorithmic design choices.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出FunLoRA方法，通过使用秩1矩阵和精心选择的函数来增强低秩适应的表达能力，解决生成模型持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，无需重训练且仅需当前任务数据。

Motivation: 深度生成模型的持续适应具有巨大潜力，但增量训练面临灾难性遗忘的挑战。现有方法依赖合成数据进行重训练，存在训练时间不断增加和长期性能下降的问题。

Method: 设计基于低秩适应(LoRA)的新型条件机制FunLoRA，专门使用秩1矩阵，通过精心选择的函数增加重参数化矩阵的秩，实现动态条件调节。

Result: 实验表明FunLoRA在基于流匹配的模型上超越了基于扩散模型的最先进方法，达到更高的分类准确率，同时仅需部分内存成本和采样时间。

Conclusion: FunLoRA方法能够保证生成模型避免灾难性遗忘，仅需当前任务数据进行训练，在参数效率、内存成本和采样时间方面都表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Continual adaptation of deep generative models holds tremendous potential and
critical importance, given their rapid and expanding usage in text and vision
based applications. Incremental training, however, remains highly challenging
due to catastrophic forgetting phenomenon, which makes it difficult for neural
networks to effectively incorporate new knowledge. A common strategy consists
in retraining the generative model on its own synthetic data in order to
mitigate forgetting. Yet, such an approach faces two major limitations: (i) the
continually increasing training time eventually becomes intractable, and (ii)
reliance on synthetic data inevitably leads to long-term performance
degradation, since synthetic samples lack the richness of real training data.
In this paper, we attenuate these issues by designing a novel and more
expressive conditioning mechanism for generative models based on low rank
adaptation (LoRA), that exclusively employs rank 1 matrices, whose
reparametrized matrix rank is functionally increased using carefully selected
functions -- and dubbed functional LoRA: FunLoRA. Using this dynamic
conditioning, the generative model is guaranteed to avoid catastrophic
forgetting and needs only to be trained on data from the current task.
Extensive experiments using flow-matching based models trained from scratch,
showcase that our proposed parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method
surpasses prior state-of-the-art results based on diffusion models, reaching
higher classification accuracy scores, while only requiring a fraction of the
memory cost and sampling time.

### [12] [Sequence-Preserving Dual-FoV Defense for Traffic Sign and Light Recognition in Autonomous Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02642)
*Abhishek Joshi,Jahnavi Krishna Koda,Abhishek Phadke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个双视野、序列保持的鲁棒性框架，用于美国交通灯和标志识别，通过统一的三层防御堆栈框架提升自动驾驶车辆在数字和自然退化条件下的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆中的交通灯和标志识别错误直接影响导航和安全，现有方法缺乏对时间连续性、多静态视野感知以及数字和自然退化鲁棒性的考虑。

Method: 基于aiMotive、Udacity、Waymo和自录德克萨斯州视频构建多源数据集，采用双视野、序列保持的鲁棒性框架，结合特征压缩、防御性蒸馏和基于熵的异常检测的三层防御堆栈，以及序列时间投票增强。

Result: 统一防御堆栈实现了79.8mAP，将攻击成功率降低至18.2%，优于YOLOv8、YOLOv9和BEVFormer，同时将高风险误分类减少到32%。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在交通灯和标志识别中显著提高了对数字和自然退化的鲁棒性，为自动驾驶安全提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Traffic light and sign recognition are key for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs)
because perception mistakes directly influence navigation and safety. In
addition to digital adversarial attacks, models are vulnerable to existing
perturbations (glare, rain, dirt, or graffiti), which could lead to dangerous
misclassifications. The current work lacks consideration of temporal
continuity, multistatic field-of-view (FoV) sensing, and robustness to both
digital and natural degradation. This study proposes a dual FoV,
sequence-preserving robustness framework for traffic lights and signs in the
USA based on a multi-source dataset built on aiMotive, Udacity, Waymo, and
self-recorded videos from the region of Texas. Mid and long-term sequences of
RGB images are temporally aligned for four operational design domains (ODDs):
highway, night, rainy, and urban. Over a series of experiments on a real-life
application of anomaly detection, this study outlines a unified three-layer
defense stack framework that incorporates feature squeezing, defensive
distillation, and entropy-based anomaly detection, as well as sequence-wise
temporal voting for further enhancement. The evaluation measures included
accuracy, attack success rate (ASR), risk-weighted misclassification severity,
and confidence stability. Physical transferability was confirmed using probes
for recapture. The results showed that the Unified Defense Stack achieved
79.8mAP and reduced the ASR to 18.2%, which is superior to YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and
BEVFormer, while reducing the high-risk misclassification to 32%.

*Benjamin Yu,Jackie Liu,Justin Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Smart-GRPO是一种优化流匹配模型中噪声扰动的强化学习方法，通过迭代搜索策略改进噪声分布，提升奖励优化和视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流匹配模型的确定性特性使其不适合强化学习，而现有方法通过随机噪声扰动引入随机性效率低下且不稳定。

Method: 采用迭代搜索策略：解码候选扰动、用奖励函数评估、向高奖励区域优化噪声分布。

Result: 实验表明Smart-GRPO在奖励优化和视觉质量方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 为流匹配框架中的强化学习提供了实用路径，弥合了高效训练与人类对齐生成之间的差距。

Abstract: Recent advancements in flow-matching have enabled high-quality text-to-image
generation. However, the deterministic nature of flow-matching models makes
them poorly suited for reinforcement learning, a key tool for improving image
quality and human alignment. Prior work has introduced stochasticity by
perturbing latents with random noise, but such perturbations are inefficient
and unstable. We propose Smart-GRPO, the first method to optimize noise
perturbations for reinforcement learning in flow-matching models. Smart-GRPO
employs an iterative search strategy that decodes candidate perturbations,
evaluates them with a reward function, and refines the noise distribution
toward higher-reward regions. Experiments demonstrate that Smart-GRPO improves
both reward optimization and visual quality compared to baseline methods. Our
results suggest a practical path toward reinforcement learning in flow-matching
frameworks, bridging the gap between efficient training and human-aligned
generation.

*Junyu Shi,Yong Sun,Zhiyuan Zhang,Lijiang Liu,Zhengjie Zhang,Yuxin He,Qiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoGIC是一个统一的多模态运动生成框架，通过整合意图建模和视觉先验，解决了现有方法在捕捉动作执行因果逻辑和人类意图方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本驱动运动生成方法将合成视为语言和运动之间的双向映射，但难以捕捉动作执行的因果逻辑和驱动行为的人类意图。缺乏视觉基础进一步限制了精度和个性化。

Method: 提出MoGIC框架，联合优化多模态条件运动生成和意图预测，引入混合注意力机制实现条件标记与运动子序列的有效局部对齐。构建了440小时的Mo440H基准数据集。

Result: 微调后，MoGIC在HumanML3D和Mo440H上分别降低FID 38.6%和34.6%，在运动描述任务中超越基于LLM的方法，并支持意图预测和视觉条件生成。

Conclusion: MoGIC推进了可控运动合成和意图理解，展示了统一多模态生成能力。

Abstract: Existing text-driven motion generation methods often treat synthesis as a
bidirectional mapping between language and motion, but remain limited in
capturing the causal logic of action execution and the human intentions that
drive behavior. The absence of visual grounding further restricts precision and
personalization, as language alone cannot specify fine-grained spatiotemporal
details. We propose MoGIC, a unified framework that integrates intention
modeling and visual priors into multimodal motion synthesis. By jointly
optimizing multimodal-conditioned motion generation and intention prediction,
MoGIC uncovers latent human goals, leverages visual priors to enhance
generation, and exhibits versatile multimodal generative capability. We further
introduce a mixture-of-attention mechanism with adaptive scope to enable
effective local alignment between conditional tokens and motion subsequences.
To support this paradigm, we curate Mo440H, a 440-hour benchmark from 21
high-quality motion datasets. Experiments show that after finetuning, MoGIC
reduces FID by 38.6\% on HumanML3D and 34.6\% on Mo440H, surpasses LLM-based
methods in motion captioning with a lightweight text head, and further enables
intention prediction and vision-conditioned generation, advancing controllable

TL;DR: 提出基于运动自适应的3D重建框架，通过语义和运动先验优化控制点分配，在动态区域集中控制点，静态背景减少冗余，使用样条轨迹参数化实现更平滑的运动表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏控制方法仅基于几何分配控制点，导致静态区域冗余和动态区域不足，无法有效处理运动复杂性。

Method: 利用视觉基础模型获取语义和运动先验，建立补丁-标记-节点对应关系，应用运动自适应压缩，通过迭代体素化和运动趋势评分实现密度适应，使用基于样条的轨迹参数化替代MLP变形场。

Result: 在重建质量和效率上相比现有最先进方法有显著提升。

Conclusion: 运动自适应框架通过将控制密度与运动复杂度对齐，有效解决了控制点分配与运动复杂性不匹配的根本问题。

Abstract: Dynamic 3D reconstruction from monocular videos remains difficult due to the
ambiguity inferring 3D motion from limited views and computational demands of
modeling temporally varying scenes. While recent sparse control methods
alleviate computation by reducing millions of Gaussians to thousands of control
points, they suffer from a critical limitation: they allocate points purely by
geometry, leading to static redundancy and dynamic insufficiency. We propose a
motion-adaptive framework that aligns control density with motion complexity.
Leveraging semantic and motion priors from vision foundation models, we
establish patch-token-node correspondences and apply motion-adaptive
compression to concentrate control points in dynamic regions while suppressing
redundancy in static backgrounds. Our approach achieves flexible
representational density adaptation through iterative voxelization and motion
tendency scoring, directly addressing the fundamental mismatch between control
point allocation and motion complexity. To capture temporal evolution, we
introduce spline-based trajectory parameterization initialized by 2D tracklets,
replacing MLP-based deformation fields to achieve smoother motion
representation and more stable optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate
significant improvements in reconstruction quality and efficiency over existing
state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统去噪方法依赖手工先验，难以处理真实噪声复杂性；深度学习方法需要大量标注数据且泛化能力有限

Method: 结合无监督DIP网络（适应输入图像特定噪声）和监督预训练DRUNet网络（利用大规模数据学习表示），通过RED正则化构建混合框架

Result: 在基准数据集上的大量实验证明该方法在真实世界噪声去除方面具有优越性

Conclusion: Net2Net通过结合无监督和监督网络的优点，在有限训练数据情况下实现了更好的泛化能力和去噪性能

Abstract: Traditional denoising methods for noise removal have largely relied on
handcrafted priors, often perform well in controlled environments but struggle
to address the complexity and variability of real noise. In contrast, deep
learning-based approaches have gained prominence for learning noise
characteristics from large datasets, but these methods frequently require
extensive labeled data and may not generalize effectively across diverse noise
types and imaging conditions. In this paper, we present an innovative method,
termed as Net2Net, that combines the strengths of untrained and pre-trained
networks to tackle the challenges of real-world noise removal. The innovation
of Net2Net lies in its combination of unsupervised DIP and supervised
pre-trained model DRUNet by regularization by denoising (RED). The untrained
network adapts to the unique noise characteristics of each input image without
requiring labeled data, while the pre-trained network leverages learned
representations from large-scale datasets to deliver robust denoising
performance. This hybrid framework enhances generalization across varying noise
patterns and improves performance, particularly in scenarios with limited
training data. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the
superiority of our method for real-world noise removal.

TL;DR: Retrv-R1是首个专为多模态通用检索设计的R1风格MLLM，通过逐步推理提高检索准确性，解决了DeepSeek-R1直接应用于检索任务时的高计算成本和训练不稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DeepSeek-R1展示了强化学习提升LLM推理能力的潜力，但直接应用于检索任务不可行，主要因为多候选推理过程的高计算成本以及RL训练的不稳定性和次优结果。

Method: 引入信息压缩模块和细节检查机制减少token数量同时保留关键信息；提出新的训练范式，包括使用检索定制合成CoT数据集的激活阶段，以及采用课程奖励的强化学习。

Result: Retrv-R1在多个基准测试和任务中实现了SOTA性能、高效率和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: Retrv-R1通过创新的信息压缩和训练范式设计，成功解决了多模态检索中的计算效率和训练稳定性问题，为MLLM在检索任务中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The success of DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates the immense potential of using
reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities. This paper
introduces Retrv-R1, the first R1-style MLLM specifically designed for
multimodal universal retrieval, achieving higher performance by employing
step-by-step reasoning to produce more accurate retrieval results. We find that
directly applying the methods of DeepSeek-R1 to retrieval tasks is not
feasible, mainly due to (1) the high computational cost caused by the large
token consumption required for multiple candidates with reasoning processes,
and (2) the instability and suboptimal results when directly applying RL to
train for retrieval tasks. To address these issues, Retrv-R1 introduces an
information compression module with a details inspection mechanism, which
enhances computational efficiency by reducing the number of tokens while
ensuring that critical information for challenging candidates is preserved.
Furthermore, a new training paradigm is proposed, including an activation stage
using a retrieval-tailored synthetic CoT dataset for more effective
optimization, followed by RL with a novel curriculum reward to improve both
performance and efficiency. Incorporating these novel designs, Retrv-R1
achieves SOTA performance, high efficiency, and strong generalization ability,
as demonstrated by experiments across multiple benchmarks and tasks.

Motivation: 现有测试时自适应方法要么依赖计算昂贵的反向传播，要么只关注似然度适应而忽略了先验的重要性，限制了实时部署和性能提升。

Method: 引入动态缓存机制，存储和更新类别嵌入、空间尺度及自适应类别先验；将自适应建模为贝叶斯推理问题，融合初始VLM输出与基于缓存的预测；采用不确定性引导的融合策略。

Conclusion: BCA+通过双自适应机制和不确定性引导融合，有效校正模型的语义理解和上下文置信度，为视觉语言模型的测试时自适应提供了高效统一的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP and Grounding DINO have achieved
remarkable success in object recognition and detection. However, their
performance often degrades under real-world distribution shifts. Test-time
adaptation (TTA) aims to mitigate this issue by adapting models during
inference. Existing methods either rely on computationally expensive
backpropagation, which hinders real-time deployment, or focus solely on
likelihood adaptation, which overlooks the critical role of the prior. Our
prior work, Bayesian Class Adaptation (BCA), addressed these shortcomings for
object recognition by introducing a training-free framework that incorporates
adaptive priors. Building upon this foundation, we now present Bayesian Class
Adaptation plus (BCA+), a unified, training-free framework for TTA for both
object recognition and detection. BCA+ introduces a dynamic cache that
adaptively stores and updates class embeddings, spatial scales (for detection),
and, crucially, adaptive class priors derived from historical predictions. We
formulate adaptation as a Bayesian inference problem, where final predictions
are generated by fusing the initial VLM output with a cache-based prediction.
This cache-based prediction combines a dynamically updated likelihood
(measuring feature and scale similarity) and a prior (reflecting the evolving
class distribution). This dual-adaptation mechanism, coupled with
uncertainty-guided fusion, enables BCA+ to correct both the model's semantic
understanding and its contextual confidence. As a training-free method
requiring no backpropagation, BCA+ is highly efficient. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that BCA+ achieves state-of-the-art performance on both recognition
and detection benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有脑肿瘤分类方法局限于预定义类别，无法识别训练时未见过的肿瘤类型。GCD方法虽然能识别未知类别，但缺乏对脑肿瘤层次分类结构的考虑。

Method: 提出层次广义类别发现方法(HGCD-BT)，将半监督层次聚类损失整合到基于对比学习的GCD框架中，捕捉脑肿瘤分类的层次结构。

Result: 在OpenSRH数据集上，HGCD-BT在斑块级分类中比最先进GCD方法准确率提升28%，特别是在识别未见过的肿瘤类别方面表现优异。在Digital Brain Tumor Atlas的切片级分类中也验证了方法的通用性。

Conclusion: HGCD-BT能有效识别脑肿瘤图像中的已知和未知类别，考虑了肿瘤分类的层次结构，在多种成像模态中都具有良好的通用性。

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor classification is critical for intra-operative decision
making in neuro-oncological surgery. However, existing approaches are
restricted to a fixed set of predefined classes and are therefore unable to
capture patterns of tumor types not available during training. Unsupervised
learning can extract general-purpose features, but it lacks the ability to
incorporate prior knowledge from labelled data, and semi-supervised methods
often assume that all potential classes are represented in the labelled data.
Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to bridge this gap by categorizing
both known and unknown classes within unlabelled data. To reflect the
hierarchical structure of brain tumor taxonomies, in this work, we introduce
Hierarchical Generalized Category Discovery for Brain Tumor Classification
(HGCD-BT), a novel approach that integrates hierarchical clustering with
contrastive learning. Our method extends contrastive learning based GCD by
incorporating a novel semi-supervised hierarchical clustering loss. We evaluate
HGCD-BT on OpenSRH, a dataset of stimulated Raman histology brain tumor images,
achieving a +28% improvement in accuracy over state-of-the-art GCD methods for
patch-level classification, particularly in identifying previously unseen tumor
categories. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of HGCD-BT on
slide-level classification of hematoxylin and eosin stained whole-slide images
from the Digital Brain Tumor Atlas, confirming its utility across imaging
modalities.

Method: 提出最大化统一的相关性-多样性最大体积目标函数，结合查询条件相关性评分和对数行列式多样性组件，并采用轻量级相关性感知门控机制处理弱对齐查询。

Conclusion: AdaRD-Key是一种无需训练、计算高效且与现有视觉语言模型兼容的即插即用解决方案，能够有效提升长视频理解能力。

Abstract: Understanding long-form videos remains a significant challenge for
vision--language models (VLMs) due to their extensive temporal length and high
information density. Most current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) rely
on uniform sampling, which often overlooks critical moments, leading to
incorrect responses to queries. In parallel, many keyframe selection approaches
impose rigid temporal spacing: once a frame is chosen, an exclusion window
suppresses adjacent timestamps to reduce redundancy. While effective at
limiting overlap, this strategy frequently misses short, fine-grained cues near
important events. Other methods instead emphasize visual diversity but neglect
query relevance. We propose AdaRD-Key, a training-free keyframe sampling module
for query-driven long-form video understanding. AdaRD-Key maximizes a unified
Relevance--Diversity Max-Volume (RD-MV) objective, combining a
query-conditioned relevance score with a log-determinant diversity component to
yield informative yet non-redundant frames. To handle broad queries with weak
alignment to the video, AdaRD-Key employs a lightweight relevance-aware gating
mechanism; when the relevance distribution indicates weak alignment, the method
seamlessly shifts into a diversity-only mode, enhancing coverage without
additional supervision. Our pipeline is training-free, computationally
efficient (running in real time on a single GPU), and compatible with existing
VLMs in a plug-and-play manner. Extensive experiments on LongVideoBench and
Video-MME demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, particularly on long-form
videos. Code available at https://github.com/Xian867/AdaRD-Key.

Motivation: 虽然视觉语言模型在多模态任务中表现出色，但其在复杂横向思维挑战（如字谜）上的认知过程仍不透明。现有研究表明这些模型在解决字谜方面存在显著困难，但底层的推理过程和失败模式尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 研究构建了一个包含221个字谜的系统标注数据集，涵盖六个认知类别，并开发了一个将推理质量与答案正确性分离的评估框架。调查了三种提示策略以引出不同类型的解释过程。

Result: 研究发现推理质量在不同谜题类别间差异显著，模型在视觉组合方面表现出系统性优势，但在缺失解释和文化象征方面存在根本局限性。提示策略对认知方法和问题解决效果有显著影响。

Conclusion: 可解释性应被视为模型性能的组成部分而非事后考虑，提示策略显著影响模型的认知过程和问题解决能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet their
cognitive processes remain opaque on complex lateral thinking challenges like
rebus puzzles. While recent work has demonstrated these models struggle
significantly with rebus puzzle solving, the underlying reasoning processes and
failure patterns remain largely unexplored. We address this gap through a
comprehensive explainability analysis that moves beyond performance metrics to
understand how VLMs approach these complex lateral thinking challenges. Our
study contributes a systematically annotated dataset of 221 rebus puzzles
across six cognitive categories, paired with an evaluation framework that
separates reasoning quality from answer correctness. We investigate three
prompting strategies designed to elicit different types of explanatory
processes and reveal critical insights into VLM cognitive processes. Our
findings demonstrate that reasoning quality varies dramatically across puzzle
categories, with models showing systematic strengths in visual composition
while exhibiting fundamental limitations in absence interpretation and cultural
symbolism. We also discover that prompting strategy substantially influences
both cognitive approach and problem-solving effectiveness, establishing
explainability as an integral component of model performance rather than a
post-hoc consideration.

Conclusion: 提出的合成方法能够创建更真实和具有挑战性的文本移除基准，解决了现有数据集的局限性，有助于提升文本移除模型的跨域泛化能力。

Abstract: Text removal is a crucial task in computer vision with applications such as
privacy preservation, image editing, and media reuse. While existing research
has primarily focused on scene text removal in natural images, limitations in
current datasets hinder out-of-domain generalization or accurate evaluation. In
particular, widely used benchmarks such as SCUT-EnsText suffer from ground
truth artifacts due to manual editing, overly simplistic text backgrounds, and
evaluation metrics that do not capture the quality of generated results. To
address these issues, we introduce an approach to synthesizing a text removal
benchmark applicable to domains other than scene texts. Our dataset features
text rendered on complex backgrounds using object-aware placement and
vision-language model-generated content, ensuring clean ground truth and
challenging text removal scenarios. The dataset is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种简单、检测器无关的框架，通过模态上下文注意力(MoCA)和查询表示对齐预训练(QueryREPA)来对齐DETR风格对象查询与模态上下文，解决多模态医学目标检测中的统计异质性和表示空间不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单一检测器在混合医学模态(如CXR、CT、MRI)上训练时，由于统计异质性和不相交的表示空间而表现不佳，需要将不同来源的特征对齐到共享空间中。

Method: 定义模态标记作为紧凑的文本派生嵌入，通过MoCA将模态标记集成到检测过程中，使用自注意力混合对象查询表示以传播模态上下文；引入QueryREPA预训练阶段，使用任务特定的对比目标在模态平衡批次中对齐查询表示与模态标记。

Result: 该方法在多种模态联合训练时持续提高AP，具有最小开销且无需架构修改，为稳健的多模态医学目标检测提供了实用路径。

Conclusion: MoCA和QueryREPA共同产生模态感知、类别忠实的查询，能有效迁移到下游训练，显著提升多模态医学目标检测性能。

Abstract: Medical object detection suffers when a single detector is trained on mixed
medical modalities (e.g., CXR, CT, MRI) due to heterogeneous statistics and
disjoint representation spaces. To address this challenge, we turn to
representation alignment, an approach that has proven effective for bringing
features from different sources into a shared space. Specifically, we target
the representations of DETR-style object queries and propose a simple,
detector-agnostic framework to align them with modality context. First, we
define modality tokens: compact, text-derived embeddings encoding imaging
modality that are lightweight and require no extra annotations. We integrate
the modality tokens into the detection process via Multimodality Context
Attention (MoCA), mixing object-query representations via self-attention to
propagate modality context within the query set. This preserves DETR-style
architectures and adds negligible latency while injecting modality cues into
object queries. We further introduce QueryREPA, a short pretraining stage that
aligns query representations to their modality tokens using a task-specific
contrastive objective with modality-balanced batches. Together, MoCA and
QueryREPA produce modality-aware, class-faithful queries that transfer
effectively to downstream training. Across diverse modalities trained
altogether, the proposed approach consistently improves AP with minimal
overhead and no architectural modifications, offering a practical path toward
robust multimodality medical object detection. Project page:

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-7b和Qwen-VL-7b上的评估显示，MaskCD在CHAIR、POPE、AMBER和MME等基准测试中有效缓解幻觉现象。

Conclusion: MaskCD能够有效减轻大视觉语言模型的幻觉问题，同时保持模型的通用能力。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
visual-language understanding for downstream multimodal tasks. While their
capabilities are improving, problems emerge simultaneously. Among those
problems, the hallucinations have attracted much attention, which stands for
the phenomenon where LVLMs generate contradictory content to their input visual
and text contents. Many approaches have been proposed to deal with this issue,
such as contrastive decoding and attention manipulation. However, contrastive
decoding methods struggle in constructing appropriate contrastive samples, and
attention manipulation methods are highly sensitive, lacking stability. In this
work, we propose image head Masked Contrastive Decoding (MaskCD). Our approach
utilizes the "image heads" in LVLMs, masking them to construct contrastive
samples for contrastive decoding. We evaluated MaskCD on LLaVA-1.5-7b and
Qwen-VL-7b, using various benchmarks such as CHAIR, POPE, AMBER and MME. The
results demonstrate that MaskCD effectively alleviates the phenomenon of
hallucinations and retains the general capabilities of LVLMs. Corresponding

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 压缩视频动作识别虽然降低了存储和计算成本，但存在动态信息粗糙噪声大、RGB和运动模态融合不足的问题

Method: 采用双流架构，运动流使用多尺度块和去噪模块增强表示学习，通过SMC和CMA模块加强模态间交互

Result: 在UCF-101、HMDB-51和Kinetics-400基准测试上表现出有效性和效率

Conclusion: MEACI-Net通过运动增强和跨模态交互有效提升了压缩视频动作识别的性能

Abstract: Compressed video action recognition has recently drawn growing attention,
since it remarkably reduces the storage and computational cost via replacing
raw videos by sparsely sampled RGB frames and compressed motion cues (e.g.,
motion vectors and residuals). However, this task severely suffers from the
coarse and noisy dynamics and the insufficient fusion of the heterogeneous RGB
and motion modalities. To address the two issues above, this paper proposes a
novel framework, namely Attentive Cross-modal Interaction Network with Motion
Enhancement (MEACI-Net). It follows the two-stream architecture, i.e. one for
the RGB modality and the other for the motion modality. Particularly, the
motion stream employs a multi-scale block embedded with a denoising module to
enhance representation learning. The interaction between the two streams is
then strengthened by introducing the Selective Motion Complement (SMC) and
Cross-Modality Augment (CMA) modules, where SMC complements the RGB modality
with spatio-temporally attentive local motion features and CMA further combines
the two modalities with selective feature augmentation. Extensive experiments
on the UCF-101, HMDB-51 and Kinetics-400 benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of MEACI-Net.

Abstract: Pose estimation is still a challenge at the small scales. Few solutions exist
to capture the 6 degrees of freedom of an object with nanometric and
microradians resolutions over relatively large ranges. Over the years, we have
proposed several fiducial marker and pattern designs to achieve reliable
performance for various microscopy applications. Centimeter ranges are possible
using pattern encoding methods, while nanometer resolutions can be achieved
using phase processing of the periodic frames. This paper presents VERNIER, an
open source phase processing software designed to provide fast and reliable
pose measurement based on pseudo-periodic patterns. Thanks to a phase-based
local thresholding algorithm, the software has proven to be particularly robust
to noise, defocus and occlusion. The successive steps of the phase processing
are presented, as well as the different types of patterns that address
different application needs. The implementation procedure is illustrated with
synthetic and experimental images. Finally, guidelines are given for selecting
the appropriate pattern design and microscope magnification lenses as a
function of the desired performance.

Method: 将多模态医学数据视为带质量驱动选择机制的序列帧，设计三个协作模块：PreWeightNet（全局贡献评估）、ThresholdNet（自适应过滤）、EffiWeightNet（有效权重计算），并提出因果模态身份模块（CMIM）保持模态一致性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Med-K2N显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 通过渐进增强和质量驱动选择机制，Med-K2N有效解决了多模态医学图像合成中的关键挑战，取得了优越性能。

Abstract: Cross-modal medical image synthesis research focuses on reconstructing
missing imaging modalities from available ones to support clinical diagnosis.
Driven by clinical necessities for flexible modality reconstruction, we explore
K to N medical generation, where three critical challenges emerge: How can we
model the heterogeneous contributions of different modalities to various target
tasks? How can we ensure fusion quality control to prevent degradation from
noisy information? How can we maintain modality identity consistency in
multi-output generation? Driven by these clinical necessities, and drawing
inspiration from SAM2's sequential frame paradigm and clinicians' progressive
workflow of incrementally adding and selectively integrating multi-modal
information, we treat multi-modal medical data as sequential frames with
quality-driven selection mechanisms. Our key idea is to "learn" adaptive
weights for each modality-task pair and "memorize" beneficial fusion patterns
through progressive enhancement. To achieve this, we design three collaborative
modules: PreWeightNet for global contribution assessment, ThresholdNet for
adaptive filtering, and EffiWeightNet for effective weight computation.
Meanwhile, to maintain modality identity consistency, we propose the Causal
Modality Identity Module (CMIM) that establishes causal constraints between
generated images and target modality descriptions using vision-language
modeling. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Med-K2N
outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant margins on multiple
benchmarks. Source code is available.

Result: 多模态方法显著优于仅使用图像或仅使用表格特征的基线，在等级分类和新鲜度预测中分别达到86.57%和70.83%的准确率。

Conclusion: 该研究首次证明仅使用外部非侵入性特征就能有效评估鸡蛋内部质量，为鸡蛋质量无损检测提供了新方法。

Abstract: Accurate, non-destructive assessment of egg quality is critical for ensuring
food safety, maintaining product standards, and operational efficiency in
commercial poultry production. This paper introduces ELMF4EggQ, an ensemble
learning framework that employs multimodal feature fusion to classify egg grade
and freshness using only external attributes - image, shape, and weight. A
novel, publicly available dataset of 186 brown-shelled eggs was constructed,
with egg grade and freshness levels determined through laboratory-based expert
assessments involving internal quality measurements, such as yolk index and
Haugh unit. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply
machine learning methods for internal egg quality assessment using only
external, non-invasive features, and the first to release a corresponding
labeled dataset. The proposed framework integrates deep features extracted from
external egg images with structural characteristics such as egg shape and
weight, enabling a comprehensive representation of each egg. Image feature
extraction is performed using top-performing pre-trained CNN models (ResNet152,
DenseNet169, and ResNet152V2), followed by PCA-based dimensionality reduction,
SMOTE augmentation, and classification using multiple machine learning
algorithms. An ensemble voting mechanism combines predictions from the
best-performing classifiers to enhance overall accuracy. Experimental results
demonstrate that the multimodal approach significantly outperforms image-only
and tabular (shape and weight) only baselines, with the multimodal ensemble
approach achieving 86.57% accuracy in grade classification and 70.83% in
freshness prediction. All code and data are publicly available at

transparency, reproducibility, and further research in this domain.

*Lorenzo Bianchi,Giacomo Pacini,Fabio Carrara,Nicola Messina,Giuseppe Amato,Fabrizio Falchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一的零样本图像描述框架，从图像中心转向补丁中心范式，无需区域级监督即可描述任意图像区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本描述模型仅限于全局表示和整图描述，无法描述图像中的特定区域。

Method: 将单个图像补丁作为原子描述单元，通过聚合补丁特征来描述从单个补丁到非连续区域和整个图像的任意区域。

Result: 使用DINO等生成有意义的密集视觉特征的主干网络，在多个基于区域的描述任务中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 补丁级语义表示对于可扩展的描述生成非常有效，在密集描述、区域集描述和新引入的轨迹描述任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Zero-shot captioners are recently proposed models that utilize common-space
vision-language representations to caption images without relying on paired
image-text data. To caption an image, they proceed by textually decoding a
text-aligned image feature, but they limit their scope to global
representations and whole-image captions. We present \frameworkName{}, a
unified framework for zero-shot captioning that shifts from an image-centric to
a patch-centric paradigm, enabling the captioning of arbitrary regions without
the need of region-level supervision. Instead of relying on global image
representations, we treat individual patches as atomic captioning units and
aggregate them to describe arbitrary regions, from single patches to
non-contiguous areas and entire images. We analyze the key ingredients that
enable current latent captioners to work in our novel proposed framework.
Experiments demonstrate that backbones producing meaningful, dense visual
features, such as DINO, are key to achieving state-of-the-art performance in
multiple region-based captioning tasks. Compared to other baselines and
state-of-the-art competitors, our models achieve better performance on
zero-shot dense, region-set, and a newly introduced trace captioning task,
highlighting the effectiveness of patch-wise semantic representations for
scalable caption generation. Project page at https://paciosoft.com/Patch-ioner/ .

*Laith Nayal,Hadi Salloum,Ahmad Taha,Yaroslav Kholodov,Alexander Gasnikov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的方法，利用InternImage骨干网络特征和K-Means聚类结合置信度阈值来检测语义分割中的未知对象，在多个基准测试中表现优于有监督和无监督基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义分割中的未知对象检测对自动驾驶等安全关键应用至关重要。虽然大型视觉基础模型在闭集语义任务中表现出色，但它们在检测分布外区域的能力尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 使用InternImage骨干网络提取特征，应用K-Means聚类并结合原始解码器logits的置信度阈值来识别分布外聚类，整个过程无需训练。

Result: 在RoadAnomaly基准测试上达到50.02平均精度，在ADE-OoD基准测试上达到48.77平均精度，超越了多个有监督和无监督基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为通用分布外分割方法提供了一个有前景的方向，只需要最少的假设或额外数据。

Abstract: Detecting unknown objects in semantic segmentation is crucial for
safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. Large vision
foundation models, includ- ing DINOv2, InternImage, and CLIP, have advanced
visual representation learn- ing by providing rich features that generalize
well across diverse tasks. While their strength in closed-set semantic tasks is
established, their capability to detect out- of-distribution (OoD) regions in
semantic segmentation remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate
whether foundation models fine-tuned on segmen- tation datasets can inherently
distinguish in-distribution (ID) from OoD regions without any outlier
supervision. We propose a simple, training-free approach that utilizes features
from the InternImage backbone and applies K-Means clustering alongside
confidence thresholding on raw decoder logits to identify OoD clusters. Our
method achieves 50.02 Average Precision on the RoadAnomaly benchmark and 48.77
on the benchmark of ADE-OoD with InternImage-L, surpassing several supervised
and unsupervised baselines. These results suggest a promising direc- tion for
generic OoD segmentation methods that require minimal assumptions or additional
data.

*Xin Zou,Di Lu,Yizhou Wang,Yibo Yan,Yuanhuiyi Lyu,Xu Zheng,Linfeng Zhang,Xuming Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HoloV是一个简单有效的视觉token剪枝框架，通过从整体视角重新思考token保留策略，在不同空间裁剪中自适应分配剪枝预算，解决了现有基于注意力的剪枝方法在高剪枝率下性能下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型依赖大量视觉token导致计算开销巨大，现有基于注意力机制的token剪枝方法在高剪枝率下会保留语义相似的token，导致性能显著下降。

Method: 提出HoloV框架，从整体视角重新思考token保留策略，通过在不同空间裁剪中自适应分配剪枝预算，确保保留的token能够捕捉全局视觉上下文而非孤立的显著特征。

Result: 实验结果显示HoloV在各种任务、MLLM架构和剪枝率下均优于现有方法。例如，LLaVA1.5使用HoloV在剪枝88.9%视觉token后仍能保持95.8%的原始性能。

Conclusion: HoloV通过整体视角的token剪枝策略，最小化了表示崩溃，在激进剪枝下仍能保持任务相关信息，实现了优越的效率-精度权衡。

Abstract: Despite their powerful capabilities, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
suffer from considerable computational overhead due to their reliance on
massive visual tokens. Recent studies have explored token pruning to alleviate
this problem, which typically uses text-vision cross-attention or
[\texttt{CLS}] attention to assess and discard redundant visual tokens. In this
work, we identify a critical limitation of such attention-first pruning
approaches, i.e., they tend to preserve semantically similar tokens, resulting
in pronounced performance drops under high pruning ratios. To this end, we
propose {HoloV}, a simple yet effective, plug-and-play visual token pruning
framework for efficient inference. Distinct from previous attention-first
schemes, HoloV rethinks token retention from a holistic perspective. By
adaptively distributing the pruning budget across different spatial crops,
HoloV ensures that the retained tokens capture the global visual context rather
than isolated salient features. This strategy minimizes representational
collapse and maintains task-relevant information even under aggressive pruning.
Experimental results demonstrate that our HoloV achieves superior performance
across various tasks, MLLM architectures, and pruning ratios compared to SOTA
methods. For instance, LLaVA1.5 equipped with HoloV preserves 95.8\% of the
original performance after pruning 88.9\% of visual tokens, achieving superior
efficiency-accuracy trade-offs.

*Nikoo Naghavian,Mostafa Tavassolipour*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Confidence-Aware Weighting (CAW)方法增强视觉语言模型的零样本鲁棒性，通过置信度感知损失和特征对齐正则化来提升清洁和对抗精度，在多个数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型如CLIP在零样本泛化方面表现出色，但对对抗攻击高度脆弱，需要提升其鲁棒性。

Method: CAW包含两个组件：置信度感知损失（通过缩放清洁和对抗预测的KL散度来优先处理不确定的对抗样本）和特征对齐正则化（通过最小化冻结和微调图像编码器在对抗输入上的特征距离来保持语义一致性）。

Result: 在TinyImageNet和14个额外数据集上的广泛实验表明，CAW在AutoAttack等强攻击下优于PMG-AFT和TGA-ZSR等最新方法，同时使用更少内存。

Conclusion: CAW能够在不牺牲泛化能力的情况下同时提高清洁精度和鲁棒精度，为视觉语言模型的零样本鲁棒性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models like CLIP demonstrate impressive zero-shot
generalization but remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this
work, we propose Confidence-Aware Weighting (CAW) to enhance zero-shot
robustness in vision-language models. CAW consists of two components: (1) a
Confidence-Aware loss that prioritizes uncertain adversarial examples by
scaling the KL divergence between clean and adversarial predictions, and (2) a
feature alignment regularization that preserves semantic consistency by
minimizing the distance between frozen and fine-tuned image encoder features on
adversarial inputs. These components work jointly to improve both clean and
robust accuracy without sacrificing generalization. Extensive experiments on
TinyImageNet and 14 additional datasets show that CAW outperforms recent
methods such as PMG-AFT and TGA-ZSR under strong attacks like AutoAttack, while
using less memory.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了大型视觉语言模型在整合超声成像和临床数据用于颈动脉粥样硬化风险评估中的表现，发现现有模型在风险分类方面表现不佳，但通过领域适应和多模态数据整合可以显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 颈动脉粥样硬化疾病的风险评估需要整合多样化的临床和影像信息，且需要透明和可解释的方法供临床医生使用，但目前缺乏有效的多模态评估工具。

Method: 提出了一个模拟真实诊断场景的框架，比较了多种开源LVLMs，包括通用模型和医学专用模型。使用零样本实验评估模型性能，然后通过低秩适应（LoRA）对LLaVa-NeXT-Vicuna进行超声领域适应，并整合多模态表格数据。

Result: 零样本实验显示，并非所有LVLMs都能准确识别成像模态和解剖结构，所有模型在准确风险分类方面表现不佳。经过领域适应后，中风风险分层性能显著提升，整合多模态表格数据进一步提高了特异性和平衡准确率，性能与先前在同一数据集上训练的CNN基线相当。

Conclusion: LVLMs在基于超声的心血管风险预测中既有前景也有局限性，强调了多模态整合、模型校准和领域适应对于临床转化的重要性。

Abstract: Reliable risk assessment for carotid atheromatous disease remains a major
clinical challenge, as it requires integrating diverse clinical and imaging
information in a manner that is transparent and interpretable to clinicians.
This study investigates the potential of state-of-the-art and recent large
vision-language models (LVLMs) for multimodal carotid plaque assessment by
integrating ultrasound imaging (USI) with structured clinical, demographic,
laboratory, and protein biomarker data. A framework that simulates realistic
diagnostic scenarios through interview-style question sequences is proposed,
comparing a range of open-source LVLMs, including both general-purpose and
medically tuned models. Zero-shot experiments reveal that even if they are very
powerful, not all LVLMs can accurately identify imaging modality and anatomy,
while all of them perform poorly in accurate risk classification. To address
this limitation, LLaVa-NeXT-Vicuna is adapted to the ultrasound domain using
low-rank adaptation (LoRA), resulting in substantial improvements in stroke
risk stratification. The integration of multimodal tabular data in the form of
text further enhances specificity and balanced accuracy, yielding competitive
performance compared to prior convolutional neural network (CNN) baselines
trained on the same dataset. Our findings highlight both the promise and
limitations of LVLMs in ultrasound-based cardiovascular risk prediction,
underscoring the importance of multimodal integration, model calibration, and
domain adaptation for clinical translation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用深度自编码器生成器参数效率低，缺乏可解释的训练策略，需要改进多期相增强MRI合成中的特征分离。

Method: 使用Flip Distribution Alignment变分自编码器，将输入和目标图像编码为关于标准正态分布对称的两个潜在分布，采用Y形双向训练策略增强特征分离可解释性。

Result: 相比现有深度自编码器端到端合成方法，FDA-VAE显著减少模型参数和推理时间，同时有效提高合成质量。

Conclusion: FDA-VAE为多期相增强MRI合成提供了一种轻量级且可解释的特征解耦解决方案。

Abstract: Separating shared and independent features is crucial for multi-phase
contrast-enhanced (CE) MRI synthesis. However, existing methods use deep
autoencoder generators with low parameter efficiency and lack interpretable
training strategies. In this paper, we propose Flip Distribution Alignment
Variational Autoencoder (FDA-VAE), a lightweight feature-decoupled VAE model
for multi-phase CE MRI synthesis. Our method encodes input and target images
into two latent distributions that are symmetric concerning a standard normal
distribution, effectively separating shared and independent features. The
Y-shaped bidirectional training strategy further enhances the interpretability
of feature separation. Experimental results show that compared to existing deep
autoencoder-based end-to-end synthesis methods, FDA-VAE significantly reduces
model parameters and inference time while effectively improving synthesis
quality. The source code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了LPG-Bench基准测试和TIT评估方法，用于评估长提示文本到图像生成的性能，解决了现有模型对长提示理解不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在短提示下表现良好，但在处理长而详细的提示时存在理解不一致的问题，需要专门的评估基准和方法。

Method: 构建包含200个平均长度超过250词的长提示基准LPG-Bench，并提出了基于文本-图像-文本一致性的TIT评估框架，包括TIT-Score和TIT-Score-LLM两种实现方式。

Result: 在13个先进模型上生成2600张图像，TIT-Score-LLM在人类偏好一致性方面比最强基线提高了7.31%的绝对准确率。

Conclusion: LPG-Bench和TIT方法为文本到图像模型的基准测试和发展提供了更深入的视角，所有资源将公开可用。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large multimodal models (LMMs), recent
text-to-image (T2I) models can generate high-quality images and demonstrate
great alignment to short prompts. However, they still struggle to effectively
understand and follow long and detailed prompts, displaying inconsistent
generation. To address this challenge, we introduce LPG-Bench, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating long-prompt-based text-to-image generation. LPG-Bench
features 200 meticulously crafted prompts with an average length of over 250
words, approaching the input capacity of several leading commercial models.
Using these prompts, we generate 2,600 images from 13 state-of-the-art models
and further perform comprehensive human-ranked annotations. Based on LPG-Bench,
we observe that state-of-the-art T2I alignment evaluation metrics exhibit poor
consistency with human preferences on long-prompt-based image generation. To
address the gap, we introduce a novel zero-shot metric based on
text-to-image-to-text consistency, termed TIT, for evaluating
long-prompt-generated images. The core concept of TIT is to quantify T2I
alignment by directly comparing the consistency between the raw prompt and the
LMM-produced description on the generated image, which includes an efficient
score-based instantiation TIT-Score and a large-language-model (LLM) based
instantiation TIT-Score-LLM. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework achieves superior alignment with human judgment compared to
CLIP-score, LMM-score, etc., with TIT-Score-LLM attaining a 7.31% absolute
improvement in pairwise accuracy over the strongest baseline. LPG-Bench and TIT
methods together offer a deeper perspective to benchmark and foster the
development of T2I models. All resources will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 探索在辐射场语义蒸馏中，几何基础语义特征是否比纯视觉特征更有优势，特别是在空间任务如姿态估计中的表现。

Method: 提出SPINE框架，包含基于蒸馏语义的粗反演和基于光度优化的细反演两个核心组件，用于无初始猜测的辐射场反演。

Result: 几何基础特征包含更精细的结构细节，但在语义目标定位任务中无显著差异，在姿态估计任务中精度反而下降。

Conclusion: 纯视觉特征在更广泛的下游任务中具有更大通用性，未来需要研究更有效的几何基础策略来增强预训练语义特征的通用性和性能。

Abstract: Semantic distillation in radiance fields has spurred significant advances in
open-vocabulary robot policies, e.g., in manipulation and navigation, founded
on pretrained semantics from large vision models. While prior work has
demonstrated the effectiveness of visual-only semantic features (e.g., DINO and
CLIP) in Gaussian Splatting and neural radiance fields, the potential benefit
of geometry-grounding in distilled fields remains an open question. In
principle, visual-geometry features seem very promising for spatial tasks such
as pose estimation, prompting the question: Do geometry-grounded semantic
features offer an edge in distilled fields? Specifically, we ask three critical
questions: First, does spatial-grounding produce higher-fidelity geometry-aware
semantic features? We find that image features from geometry-grounded backbones
contain finer structural details compared to their counterparts. Secondly, does
geometry-grounding improve semantic object localization? We observe no
significant difference in this task. Thirdly, does geometry-grounding enable
higher-accuracy radiance field inversion? Given the limitations of prior work
and their lack of semantics integration, we propose a novel framework SPINE for
inverting radiance fields without an initial guess, consisting of two core
components: coarse inversion using distilled semantics, and fine inversion
using photometric-based optimization. Surprisingly, we find that the pose
estimation accuracy decreases with geometry-grounded features. Our results
suggest that visual-only features offer greater versatility for a broader range
of downstream tasks, although geometry-grounded features contain more geometric
detail. Notably, our findings underscore the necessity of future research on
effective strategies for geometry-grounding that augment the versatility and
performance of pretrained semantic features.

Motivation: 解决现有3D编辑方法存在的速度慢、几何失真、依赖手动3D掩码等问题，提升3D编辑的跨视图一致性、结构保真度和细粒度可控性。

Method: 构建了116,309个高质量训练对的3DEditVerse数据集，并提出3DEditFormer模型，采用双引导注意力和时间自适应门控机制来保持3D结构，实现精确编辑。

Result: 在广泛实验中，该框架在定量和定性评估上都优于现有最先进方法，为实用和可扩展的3D编辑设立了新标准。

Conclusion: 通过数据和模型的双重创新，实现了无需辅助3D掩码的高质量3D编辑，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: 3D editing - the task of locally modifying the geometry or appearance of a 3D
asset - has wide applications in immersive content creation, digital
entertainment, and AR/VR. However, unlike 2D editing, it remains challenging
due to the need for cross-view consistency, structural fidelity, and
fine-grained controllability. Existing approaches are often slow, prone to
geometric distortions, or dependent on manual and accurate 3D masks that are
error-prone and impractical. To address these challenges, we advance both the
data and model fronts. On the data side, we introduce 3DEditVerse, the largest
paired 3D editing benchmark to date, comprising 116,309 high-quality training
pairs and 1,500 curated test pairs. Built through complementary pipelines of
pose-driven geometric edits and foundation model-guided appearance edits,
3DEditVerse ensures edit locality, multi-view consistency, and semantic
alignment. On the model side, we propose 3DEditFormer, a
3D-structure-preserving conditional transformer. By enhancing image-to-3D
generation with dual-guidance attention and time-adaptive gating, 3DEditFormer
disentangles editable regions from preserved structure, enabling precise and
consistent edits without requiring auxiliary 3D masks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines both
quantitatively and qualitatively, establishing a new standard for practical and
scalable 3D editing. Dataset and code will be released. Project:

Motivation: 现有方法难以建模复杂动态交互，且密集精确的掩码标注在现实应用中获取困难，需要一种无需密集掩码输入但能保持灵活控制的交互视频生成方法。

Method: 采用解耦的两阶段流程：首先预测执行者和对象的合理运动轨迹，然后基于这些轨迹生成视频。支持通过动作描述或空间位置线索来引导运动轨迹。

Result: 在两个涵盖人机交互和机器人操作场景的基准测试中，方法在视觉真实性和可控性方面优于现有基线。

Conclusion: Mask2IV框架成功解决了交互视频生成中密集掩码依赖的问题，实现了高质量且可控的交互视频生成，适用于机器人学习和操作策略训练。

Abstract: Generating interaction-centric videos, such as those depicting humans or
robots interacting with objects, is crucial for embodied intelligence, as they
provide rich and diverse visual priors for robot learning, manipulation policy
training, and affordance reasoning. However, existing methods often struggle to
model such complex and dynamic interactions. While recent studies show that
masks can serve as effective control signals and enhance generation quality,
obtaining dense and precise mask annotations remains a major challenge for
real-world use. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Mask2IV, a novel
framework specifically designed for interaction-centric video generation. It
adopts a decoupled two-stage pipeline that first predicts plausible motion
trajectories for both actor and object, then generates a video conditioned on
these trajectories. This design eliminates the need for dense mask inputs from
users while preserving the flexibility to manipulate the interaction process.
Furthermore, Mask2IV supports versatile and intuitive control, allowing users
to specify the target object of interaction and guide the motion trajectory
through action descriptions or spatial position cues. To support systematic
training and evaluation, we curate two benchmarks covering diverse action and
object categories across both human-object interaction and robotic manipulation
scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior
visual realism and controllability compared to existing baselines.

Result: 在DFC2020数据集上，NDI注入使U-Net性能提升1.99%，DeepLabV3提升2.78%；在云覆盖条件下，结合Sentinel-1数据相比仅使用光学数据在所有模型上均获得显著性能提升。

Conclusion: NDI注入方法能有效增强土地覆盖分割性能，Sentinel-1雷达数据在云覆盖条件下能有效补充光学图像，雷达-光学融合在挑战性大气场景中具有显著效果。

Abstract: Supervised deep learning for land cover semantic segmentation (LCS) relies on
labeled satellite data. However, most existing Sentinel-2 datasets are
cloud-free, which limits their usefulness in tropical regions where clouds are
common. To properly evaluate the extent of this problem, we developed a cloud
injection algorithm that simulates realistic cloud cover, allowing us to test
how Sentinel-1 radar data can fill in the gaps caused by cloud-obstructed
optical imagery. We also tackle the issue of losing spatial and/or spectral
details during encoder downsampling in deep networks. To mitigate this loss, we
propose a lightweight method that injects Normalized Difference Indices (NDIs)
into the final decoding layers, enabling the model to retain key spatial
features with minimal additional computation. Injecting NDIs enhanced land
cover segmentation performance on the DFC2020 dataset, yielding improvements of
1.99% for U-Net and 2.78% for DeepLabV3 on cloud-free imagery. Under
cloud-covered conditions, incorporating Sentinel-1 data led to significant
performance gains across all models compared to using optical data alone,
highlighting the effectiveness of radar-optical fusion in challenging
atmospheric scenarios.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation has surged in response to challenging
questions, especially when a long video must depict multiple sequential events
with temporal coherence and controllable content. Existing methods that extend
to multi-event generation omit an inspection of the intrinsic factor in event
shifting. The paper aims to answer the central question: When and where
multi-event prompts control event transition during T2V generation. This work
introduces MEve, a self-curated prompt suite for evaluating multi-event
text-to-video (T2V) generation, and conducts a systematic study of two
representative model families, i.e., OpenSora and CogVideoX. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the importance of early intervention in denoising steps
and block-wise model layers, revealing the essential factor for multi-event
video generation and highlighting the possibilities for multi-event
conditioning in future models.

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (RealSR) aims to enhance the visual quality
of in-the-wild images, such as those captured by mobile phones. While existing
methods leveraging large generative models demonstrate impressive results, the
high computational cost and latency make them impractical for edge deployment.
In this paper, we introduce PocketSR, an ultra-lightweight, single-step model
that brings generative modeling capabilities to RealSR while maintaining high
fidelity. To achieve this, we design LiteED, a highly efficient alternative to
the original computationally intensive VAE in SD, reducing parameters by 97.5%
while preserving high-quality encoding and decoding. Additionally, we propose
online annealing pruning for the U-Net, which progressively shifts generative
priors from heavy modules to lightweight counterparts, ensuring effective
knowledge transfer and further optimizing efficiency. To mitigate the loss of
prior knowledge during pruning, we incorporate a multi-layer feature
distillation loss. Through an in-depth analysis of each design component, we
provide valuable insights for future research. PocketSR, with a model size of
146M parameters, processes 4K images in just 0.8 seconds, achieving a
remarkable speedup over previous methods. Notably, it delivers performance on
par with state-of-the-art single-step and even multi-step RealSR models, making
it a highly practical solution for edge-device applications.

TL;DR: 该论文系统研究了视觉生成模型中影响组合泛化的设计选择，发现训练目标的离散/连续性质以及条件信息在训练中的提供程度是关键因素。通过在离散模型MaskGIT中引入连续JEPA目标，可以改善组合性能。


<details>

Motivation: 理解视觉生成模型中促进或抑制组合泛化（生成已知概念的新组合的能力）的机制，目前尚未完全清楚。

Method: 通过受控实验系统研究各种设计选择对图像和视频生成中组合泛化的影响，重点关注训练目标的离散/连续性质以及条件信息的提供程度。

Result: 识别出两个关键因素：(i)训练目标在离散还是连续分布上操作，(ii)条件在训练期间提供关于组成概念信息的程度。基于这些发现，在离散模型MaskGIT中引入连续JEPA目标可以改善组合性能。

Conclusion: 训练目标的离散/连续性质以及条件信息的提供程度是影响视觉生成模型组合泛化的关键因素，在离散模型中引入连续目标可以提升组合泛化能力。

Abstract: Compositional generalization, the ability to generate novel combinations of
known concepts, is a key ingredient for visual generative models. Yet, not all
mechanisms that enable or inhibit it are fully understood. In this work, we
conduct a systematic study of how various design choices influence
compositional generalization in image and video generation in a positive or
negative way. Through controlled experiments, we identify two key factors: (i)
whether the training objective operates on a discrete or continuous
distribution, and (ii) to what extent conditioning provides information about
the constituent concepts during training. Building on these insights, we show
that relaxing the MaskGIT discrete loss with an auxiliary continuous JEPA-based
objective can improve compositional performance in discrete models like
MaskGIT.

TL;DR: HAVIR模型通过分离视觉皮层的两个层次区域，分别提取结构信息和语义特征，结合潜在扩散先验和CLIP嵌入，使用Versatile Diffusion模型合成图像，在复杂场景中提升了重建的结构和语义质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在准确重建高度复杂视觉刺激方面面临挑战，主要因为自然场景的低级特征具有异质性，而高级特征由于上下文重叠而存在语义纠缠。

Method: 将视觉皮层分为两个层次区域：结构生成器从空间处理体素提取结构信息并转换为潜在扩散先验；语义提取器将语义处理体素转换为CLIP嵌入；通过Versatile Diffusion模型集成这些组件合成最终图像。

Result: 实验结果表明HAVIR在复杂场景中提升了重建的结构和语义质量，优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 基于视觉皮层层次表示理论提出的HAVIR模型，通过分离结构信息和语义特征，成功解决了复杂视觉刺激重建的挑战。

Abstract: The reconstruction of visual information from brain activity fosters
interdisciplinary integration between neuroscience and computer vision.
However, existing methods still face challenges in accurately recovering highly
complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from the characteristics of
natural scenes: low-level features exhibit heterogeneity, while high-level
features show semantic entanglement due to contextual overlaps. Inspired by the
hierarchical representation theory of the visual cortex, we propose the HAVIR
model, which separates the visual cortex into two hierarchical regions and
extracts distinct features from each. Specifically, the Structural Generator
extracts structural information from spatial processing voxels and converts it
into latent diffusion priors, while the Semantic Extractor converts semantic
processing voxels into CLIP embeddings. These components are integrated via the
Versatile Diffusion model to synthesize the final image. Experimental results
demonstrate that HAVIR enhances both the structural and semantic quality of
reconstructions, even in complex scenes, and outperforms existing models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面部表情识别在情感计算中很重要，但现有方法面临遮挡、光照变化、姿态变化、类内细微差异和数据集不平衡等挑战，特别是少数类别表情识别困难。

Method: 使用EfficientNetV2-S架构进行迁移学习，应用标准化、分层分割和数据增强，通过类别加权损失函数处理不平衡分布，微调轻量级分类头。

Conclusion: 高效架构结合针对性的不平衡处理可以提供实用、透明且可复现的面部表情识别解决方案。

Abstract: Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is a key task in affective computing,
enabling applications in human-computer interaction, e-learning, healthcare,
and safety systems. Despite advances in deep learning, FER remains challenging
due to occlusions, illumination and pose variations, subtle intra-class
differences, and dataset imbalance that hinders recognition of minority
emotions. We present InsideOut, a reproducible FER framework built on
EfficientNetV2-S with transfer learning, strong data augmentation, and
imbalance-aware optimization. The approach standardizes FER2013 images, applies
stratified splitting and augmentation, and fine-tunes a lightweight
classification head with class-weighted loss to address skewed distributions.
InsideOut achieves 62.8% accuracy with a macro averaged F1 of 0.590 on FER2013,
showing competitive results compared to conventional CNN baselines. The novelty
lies in demonstrating that efficient architectures, combined with tailored
imbalance handling, can provide practical, transparent, and reproducible FER
solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脊柱疾病影响全球6.19亿人，但AI辅助诊断受限于缺乏椎体层面感知的多模态数据集和标准化评估基准。

Method: 与脊柱外科医生合作设计，采用两阶段LLM生成方法（草稿和修订）创建高质量、可追溯的指令数据，涵盖X光、CT和MRI等多种影像模态。

Result: 在SpineBench评估中，现有LVLMs在椎体层面推理存在系统性弱点，而基于SpineMed-450k微调的模型在所有任务上都表现出显著改进。

Conclusion: SpineMed为脊柱AI诊断提供了首个大规模椎体层面推理数据集和临床评估框架，经临床医生评估证实其诊断清晰度和实用价值。

Abstract: Spine disorders affect 619 million people globally and are a leading cause of
disability, yet AI-assisted diagnosis remains limited by the lack of
level-aware, multimodal datasets. Clinical decision-making for spine disorders
requires sophisticated reasoning across X-ray, CT, and MRI at specific
vertebral levels. However, progress has been constrained by the absence of
traceable, clinically-grounded instruction data and standardized,
spine-specific benchmarks. To address this, we introduce SpineMed, an ecosystem
co-designed with practicing spine surgeons. It features SpineMed-450k, the
first large-scale dataset explicitly designed for vertebral-level reasoning
across imaging modalities with over 450,000 instruction instances, and
SpineBench, a clinically-grounded evaluation framework. SpineMed-450k is
curated from diverse sources, including textbooks, guidelines, open datasets,
and ~1,000 de-identified hospital cases, using a clinician-in-the-loop pipeline
with a two-stage LLM generation method (draft and revision) to ensure
high-quality, traceable data for question-answering, multi-turn consultations,
and report generation. SpineBench evaluates models on clinically salient axes,
including level identification, pathology assessment, and surgical planning.
Our comprehensive evaluation of several recently advanced large vision-language
models (LVLMs) on SpineBench reveals systematic weaknesses in fine-grained,
level-specific reasoning. In contrast, our model fine-tuned on SpineMed-450k
demonstrates consistent and significant improvements across all tasks.
Clinician assessments confirm the diagnostic clarity and practical utility of
our model's outputs.

TL;DR: UniShield是一个基于多智能体的统一伪造图像检测和定位系统，能够跨多个领域（图像篡改、文档篡改、DeepFake和AI生成图像）进行检测，通过感知智能体和检测智能体的协同工作实现动态模型选择和统一检测框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着图像生成技术的快速发展，合成图像越来越逼真，带来了严重的社会风险，如虚假信息和欺诈。现有领域特定的检测方法虽然性能出色，但实际应用受限，主要因为专业化程度过高、跨领域泛化能力差，且缺乏集成自适应框架。

Method: 提出UniShield系统，创新性地集成感知智能体和检测智能体。感知智能体智能分析图像特征以动态选择合适的检测模型，检测智能体将各种专家检测器整合到统一框架中并生成可解释的报告。

Result: 大量实验表明，UniShield取得了最先进的结果，超越了现有的统一方法和领域特定检测器，突显了其优越的实用性、自适应性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: UniShield通过多智能体统一框架有效解决了伪造图像检测中的跨领域泛化和自适应问题，为维护信息完整性和社会安全提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in image generation, synthetic images have become
increasingly realistic, posing significant societal risks, such as
misinformation and fraud. Forgery Image Detection and Localization (FIDL) thus
emerges as essential for maintaining information integrity and societal
security. Despite impressive performances by existing domain-specific detection
methods, their practical applicability remains limited, primarily due to their
narrow specialization, poor cross-domain generalization, and the absence of an
integrated adaptive framework. To address these issues, we propose UniShield,
the novel multi-agent-based unified system capable of detecting and localizing
image forgeries across diverse domains, including image manipulation, document
manipulation, DeepFake, and AI-generated images. UniShield innovatively
integrates a perception agent with a detection agent. The perception agent
intelligently analyzes image features to dynamically select suitable detection
models, while the detection agent consolidates various expert detectors into a
unified framework and generates interpretable reports. Extensive experiments
show that UniShield achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing both existing
unified approaches and domain-specific detectors, highlighting its superior
practicality, adaptiveness, and scalability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于扩散模型潜在空间的图像扰动方法，通过改变去噪轨迹起点来生成难以被下游模型学习和复制的图像，在保护视觉质量的同时有效防御未经授权的模型个性化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对文本到图像扩散模型在个性化应用中可能引发的数据隐私、知识产权保护和未经授权使用等问题，现有像素空间扰动方法存在视觉质量差的问题，需要开发更隐蔽的保护方法。

Method: 在潜在扩散模型的潜在空间中操作，交替进行去噪和反转过程，修改去噪轨迹的起点，通过轨迹偏移采样生成难以被逆向工程和个性化的图像。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在感知指标（PSNR、SSIM、FID）上提升约8%-10%，在五种对抗设置下平均鲁棒性提升约10%，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法成功将不可学习性集成到潜在扩散模型框架中，提供了一种实用且难以察觉的防御机制，有效保护敏感数据免受未经授权的模型适应。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in
rapid and high-fidelity personalization, even when provided with only a few
user images. However, the effectiveness of personalization techniques has lead
to concerns regarding data privacy, intellectual property protection, and
unauthorized usage. To mitigate such unauthorized usage and model replication,
the idea of generating ``unlearnable'' training samples utilizing image
poisoning techniques has emerged. Existing methods for this have limited
imperceptibility as they operate in the pixel space which results in images
with noise and artifacts. In this work, we propose a novel model-based
perturbation strategy that operates within the latent space of diffusion
models. Our method alternates between denoising and inversion while modifying
the starting point of the denoising trajectory: of diffusion models. This
trajectory-shifted sampling ensures that the perturbed images maintain high
visual fidelity to the original inputs while being resistant to inversion and
personalization by downstream generative models. This approach integrates
unlearnability into the framework of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), enabling a
practical and imperceptible defense against unauthorized model adaptation. We
validate our approach on four benchmark datasets to demonstrate robustness
against state-of-the-art inversion attacks. Results demonstrate that our method
achieves significant improvements in imperceptibility ($\sim 8 \% -10\%$ on
perceptual metrics including PSNR, SSIM, and FID) and robustness ( $\sim 10\%$
on average across five adversarial settings), highlighting its effectiveness in
safeguarding sensitive data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法依赖特征过滤或平滑处理，容易导致信息损失，需要一种既能增强鲁棒性又最小化信息损失的方法

Method: 通过引入小的平移扰动，对齐变换后的特征嵌入并聚合它们，然后映射回原始参考图像，采用闭式公式实现

Result: 在图像分类中恢复高达68.1%的准确率损失，在立体匹配中恢复71.9%，在光流中恢复29.2%，在各种对抗攻击下表现优异

Conclusion: 该方法首次为密集预测任务建立了通用的测试时防御机制，具有多功能性和实用性

Abstract: We propose a test-time defense mechanism against adversarial attacks:
imperceptible image perturbations that significantly alter the predictions of a
model. Unlike existing methods that rely on feature filtering or smoothing,
which can lead to information loss, we propose to "combat noise with noise" by
leveraging stochastic resonance to enhance robustness while minimizing
information loss. Our approach introduces small translational perturbations to
the input image, aligns the transformed feature embeddings, and aggregates them
before mapping back to the original reference image. This can be expressed in a
closed-form formula, which can be deployed on diverse existing network
architectures without introducing additional network modules or fine-tuning for
specific attack types. The resulting method is entirely training-free,
architecture-agnostic, and attack-agnostic. Empirical results show
state-of-the-art robustness on image classification and, for the first time,
establish a generic test-time defense for dense prediction tasks, including
stereo matching and optical flow, highlighting the method's versatility and
practicality. Specifically, relative to clean (unperturbed) performance, our
method recovers up to 68.1% of the accuracy loss on image classification, 71.9%
on stereo matching, and 29.2% on optical flow under various types of
adversarial attacks.

TL;DR: GeoComplete是一个用于参考驱动图像补全的新框架，通过引入显式3D结构指导来增强几何一致性，解决了现有方法在目标视图与参考图像差异较大时产生错位内容的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散先验的生成方法缺乏几何线索（如相机姿态或深度），在目标视图与参考图像差异较大时经常产生错位或不合理的内容，需要引入几何一致性指导。

Method: 采用双分支扩散架构：一个分支从掩码目标合成缺失区域，另一个分支从投影点云提取几何特征；通过联合自注意力确保一致性；引入目标感知掩码来引导模型关注相关参考线索。

Result: 实验显示GeoComplete在PSNR指标上比最先进方法提升了17.1，显著提高了几何准确性同时保持高视觉质量。

Conclusion: 通过结合几何感知的双分支扩散架构和目标感知掩码策略，GeoComplete为几何条件图像补全提供了统一且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Reference-driven image completion, which restores missing regions in a target
view using additional images, is particularly challenging when the target view
differs significantly from the references. Existing generative methods rely
solely on diffusion priors and, without geometric cues such as camera pose or
depth, often produce misaligned or implausible content. We propose GeoComplete,
a novel framework that incorporates explicit 3D structural guidance to enforce
geometric consistency in the completed regions, setting it apart from prior
image-only approaches. GeoComplete introduces two key ideas: conditioning the
diffusion process on projected point clouds to infuse geometric information,
and applying target-aware masking to guide the model toward relevant reference
cues. The framework features a dual-branch diffusion architecture. One branch
synthesizes the missing regions from the masked target, while the other
extracts geometric features from the projected point cloud. Joint
self-attention across branches ensures coherent and accurate completion. To
address regions visible in references but absent in the target, we project the
target view into each reference to detect occluded areas, which are then masked
during training. This target-aware masking directs the model to focus on useful
cues, enhancing performance in difficult scenarios. By integrating a
geometry-aware dual-branch diffusion architecture with a target-aware masking
strategy, GeoComplete offers a unified and robust solution for
geometry-conditioned image completion. Experiments show that GeoComplete
achieves a 17.1 PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods, significantly
boosting geometric accuracy while maintaining high visual quality.

TL;DR: 提出RULER tokens和I-MRoPE两种创新方法，解决GUI grounding任务中VLM在高分辨率显示上的坐标映射问题，显著提升定位精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLM在GUI grounding任务中面临核心瓶颈：可靠的patch-to-pixel映射在训练未见的高分辨率显示上失效，导致坐标生成不准确。

Method: 1. RULER tokens作为显式坐标标记，让模型能够参考位置而非从头生成坐标；2. Interleaved MRoPE改进空间编码，确保宽度和高度维度对称表示。

Result: 在ScreenSpot、ScreenSpot-V2和ScreenSpot-Pro数据集上的实验显示定位精度持续提升，在高分辨率界面上改进最大。

Conclusion: 通过提供显式空间指导而非依赖隐式学习，该方法能够在不同分辨率和平台上实现更可靠的GUI自动化。

Abstract: GUI grounding, the task of mapping natural-language instructions to pixel
coordinates, is crucial for autonomous agents, yet remains difficult for
current VLMs. The core bottleneck is reliable patch-to-pixel mapping, which
breaks when extrapolating to high-resolution displays unseen during training.
Current approaches generate coordinates as text tokens directly from visual
features, forcing the model to infer complex position-to-pixel mappings
implicitly; as a result, accuracy degrades and failures proliferate on new
resolutions. We address this with two complementary innovations. First, RULER
tokens serve as explicit coordinate markers, letting the model reference
positions similar to gridlines on a map and adjust rather than generate
coordinates from scratch. Second, Interleaved MRoPE (I-MRoPE) improves spatial
encoding by ensuring that width and height dimensions are represented equally,
addressing the asymmetry of standard positional schemes. Experiments on
ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-V2, and ScreenSpot-Pro show consistent gains in
grounding accuracy, with the largest improvements on high-resolution
interfaces. By providing explicit spatial guidance rather than relying on
implicit learning, our approach enables more reliable GUI automation across
diverse resolutions and platforms.

Conclusion: 该方法为未来的文本到声音视频生成任务提供了关键见解，所有代码和检查点将公开发布。

Abstract: This study focuses on a challenging yet promising task,
Text-to-Sounding-Video (T2SV) generation, which aims to generate a video with
synchronized audio from text conditions, meanwhile ensuring both modalities are
aligned with text. Despite progress in joint audio-video training, two critical
challenges still remain unaddressed: (1) a single, shared text caption where
the text for video is equal to the text for audio often creates modal
interference, confusing the pretrained backbones, and (2) the optimal mechanism
for cross-modal feature interaction remains unclear. To address these
challenges, we first propose the Hierarchical Visual-Grounded Captioning (HVGC)
framework that generates pairs of disentangled captions, a video caption, and
an audio caption, eliminating interference at the conditioning stage. Based on
HVGC, we further introduce BridgeDiT, a novel dual-tower diffusion transformer,
which employs a Dual CrossAttention (DCA) mechanism that acts as a robust
``bridge" to enable a symmetric, bidirectional exchange of information,
achieving both semantic and temporal synchronization. Extensive experiments on
three benchmark datasets, supported by human evaluations, demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art results on most metrics. Comprehensive
ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our contributions,
offering key insights for the future T2SV task. All the codes and checkpoints
will be publicly released.

individual- and population-level mobility structures within a probabilistic

capture both consistency and variability in daily life. Evaluations on the
Urban Anomalies dataset (Atlanta and Berlin subsets) using the Jensen-Shannon
Divergence (JSD) across population- and agent-level metrics demonstrate that
the proposed method achieves strong fidelity while remaining data- and
compute-efficient. These results position Markovian Reeb Graphs as a scalable
framework for trajectory simulation with broad applicability across diverse

Abstract: Interactive 3D biomedical image segmentation requires efficient models that

Method: 提出PQGAN，将产品量化集成到VQGAN的向量量化框架中，深入分析码书大小、嵌入维度和子空间分解之间的相互作用，将向量和标量量化作为特例。

Result: PSNR达到37dB（先前工作为27dB），FID、LPIPS和CMMD分数降低高达96%。分析发现VQ和PQ在扩展嵌入维度时表现相反，为超参数选择提供指导。

Conclusion: PQGAN在图像重建方面显著优于现有方法，并能无缝集成到预训练扩散模型中，实现更高效生成或更高分辨率输出，证明PQ是图像合成中离散潜在表示的强大扩展。

Abstract: Product quantisation (PQ) is a classical method for scalable vector encoding,
yet it has seen limited usage for latent representations in high-fidelity image
generation. In this work, we introduce PQGAN, a quantised image autoencoder
that integrates PQ into the well-known vector quantisation (VQ) framework of
VQGAN. PQGAN achieves a noticeable improvement over state-of-the-art methods in
terms of reconstruction performance, including both quantisation methods and
their continuous counterparts. We achieve a PSNR score of 37dB, where prior
work achieves 27dB, and are able to reduce the FID, LPIPS, and CMMD score by up
to 96%. Our key to success is a thorough analysis of the interaction between
codebook size, embedding dimensionality, and subspace factorisation, with
vector and scalar quantisation as special cases. We obtain novel findings, such
that the performance of VQ and PQ behaves in opposite ways when scaling the
embedding dimension. Furthermore, our analysis shows performance trends for PQ
that help guide optimal hyperparameter selection. Finally, we demonstrate that
PQGAN can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained diffusion models. This
enables either a significantly faster and more compute-efficient generation, or
a doubling of the output resolution at no additional cost, positioning PQ as a
strong extension for discrete latent representation in image synthesis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Memory Forcing学习框架，通过几何索引空间记忆和混合训练策略，解决自回归视频扩散模型在有限计算预算下长期空间一致性与新场景生成质量之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归视频扩散模型在游戏模拟中需要平衡新场景生成的自然性和已探索区域的空间一致性，但有限上下文窗口导致时间记忆缺乏长期空间一致性，而空间记忆可能过度依赖不足的上下文而降低新场景生成质量。

Method: Memory Forcing框架包含：混合训练区分探索和重访模式；链式前向训练通过模型滚动创建更大姿态变化；点对帧检索高效映射可见点到源帧；增量3D重建维护显式3D缓存。

Result: 实验表明Memory Forcing在多样化环境中实现了优越的长期空间一致性和生成质量，同时在扩展序列中保持计算效率。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了自回归视频扩散模型在有限计算预算下长期空间一致性与生成质量之间的权衡，为游戏模拟等应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Autoregressive video diffusion models have proved effective for world
modeling and interactive scene generation, with Minecraft gameplay as a
representative application. To faithfully simulate play, a model must generate
natural content while exploring new scenes and preserve spatial consistency
when revisiting explored areas. Under limited computation budgets, it must
compress and exploit historical cues within a finite context window, which
exposes a trade-off: Temporal-only memory lacks long-term spatial consistency,
whereas adding spatial memory strengthens consistency but may degrade new scene
generation quality when the model over-relies on insufficient spatial context.
We present Memory Forcing, a learning framework that pairs training protocols
with a geometry-indexed spatial memory. Hybrid Training exposes distinct
gameplay regimes, guiding the model to rely on temporal memory during
exploration and incorporate spatial memory for revisits. Chained Forward
Training extends autoregressive training with model rollouts, where chained
predictions create larger pose variations and encourage reliance on spatial
memory for maintaining consistency. Point-to-Frame Retrieval efficiently
retrieves history by mapping currently visible points to their source frames,
while Incremental 3D Reconstruction maintains and updates an explicit 3D cache.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Memory Forcing achieves superior
long-term spatial consistency and generative quality across diverse
environments, while maintaining computational efficiency for extended
sequences.

TL;DR: MonSTeR是首个运动-场景-文本检索模型，通过构建统一潜空间来捕捉模态间复杂依赖关系，在多种任务中实现灵活且鲁棒的检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究缺乏评估骨骼运动、意图和周围环境之间对齐关系的工具，而人类运动在复杂环境中需要意图驱动且环境支持。

Method: 利用单模态和跨模态表示构建统一潜空间，通过建模高阶关系来捕捉模态间复杂依赖。

Result: MonSTeR优于仅依赖单模态表示的三模态模型，检索分数与人类偏好对齐，并在零样本场景物体放置和运动描述任务中展现多功能性。

Conclusion: MonSTeR成功建立了运动、场景和文本之间的对齐关系，为多模态检索提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Intention drives human movement in complex environments, but such movement
can only happen if the surrounding context supports it. Despite the intuitive
nature of this mechanism, existing research has not yet provided tools to
evaluate the alignment between skeletal movement (motion), intention (text),
and the surrounding context (scene). In this work, we introduce MonSTeR, the
first MOtioN-Scene-TExt Retrieval model. Inspired by the modeling of
higher-order relations, MonSTeR constructs a unified latent space by leveraging
unimodal and cross-modal representations. This allows MonSTeR to capture the
intricate dependencies between modalities, enabling flexible but robust
retrieval across various tasks. Our results show that MonSTeR outperforms
trimodal models that rely solely on unimodal representations. Furthermore, we
validate the alignment of our retrieval scores with human preferences through a
dedicated user study. We demonstrate the versatility of MonSTeR's latent space
on zero-shot in-Scene Object Placement and Motion Captioning. Code and
pre-trained models are available at github.com/colloroneluca/MonSTeR.

Motivation: 现有随机神经网络方法主要关注改进跨信息预测，未对整体网络架构进行重大改进。

Method: 利用超球面随机嵌入结合双分支学习模块，捕捉通道内外关系，并通过新制定的优化问题构建丰富的纹理表示。

Result: 在多个具有不同特征和挑战的纯纹理基准测试中显示出有趣的结果。

Abstract: Randomized neural networks for representation learning have consistently
achieved prominent results in texture recognition tasks, effectively combining
the advantages of both traditional techniques and learning-based approaches.
However, existing approaches have so far focused mainly on improving
cross-information prediction, without introducing significant advancements to
the overall randomized network architecture. In this paper, we propose Mixer, a
novel randomized neural network for texture representation learning. At its
core, the method leverages hyperspherical random embeddings coupled with a
dual-branch learning module to capture both intra- and inter-channel
relationships, further enhanced by a newly formulated optimization problem for
building rich texture representations. Experimental results have shown the
interesting results of the proposed approach across several pure texture
benchmarks, each with distinct characteristics and challenges. The source code
will be available upon publication.

Result: 在胃肠道内窥镜和体育VQA实验中，LEAML在最小监督下持续优于标准微调方法。

Conclusion: LEAML框架在标签稀缺的专业领域任务中表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on
general visual benchmarks but struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks in
specialized domains such as medical imaging, where labeled data is limited and
expensive. We introduce LEAML, a label-efficient adaptation framework that
leverages both scarce labeled VQA samples and abundant unlabeled images. Our
approach generates domain-relevant pseudo question-answer pairs for unlabeled
data using a QA generator regularized by caption distillation. Importantly, we
selectively update only those neurons most relevant to question-answering,
enabling the QA Generator to efficiently acquire domain-specific knowledge
during distillation. Experiments on gastrointestinal endoscopy and sports VQA
demonstrate that LEAML consistently outperforms standard fine-tuning under
minimal supervision, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed LEAML
framework.

TL;DR: BrowserArena是一个开放的网页代理评估平台，通过收集用户提交的任务、进行Arena式对比测试和使用步骤级人工反馈来识别代理失败模式。研究发现三个主要失败模式：验证码识别、弹窗横幅移除和直接URL导航。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前网页代理评估局限于沙盒环境或人工任务，需要真实的开放网页环境来评估代理的实际表现和失败模式。

Method: 构建BrowserArena平台，收集用户提交的真实任务，进行Arena式对比测试，使用步骤级人工反馈分析代理轨迹，并针对发现的失败模式构建专门数据集进行深入研究。

Result: 识别出三个一致的失败模式：验证码解决、弹窗横幅移除和直接URL导航。不同语言模型在这些任务上表现各异，例如o4-mini使用更多策略绕过验证码，而DeepSeek-R1在验证码解决上误导用户。

Conclusion: 当前网页代理存在多样性和脆弱性，BrowserArena的基准测试方法为大规模评估和理解网页代理失败模式提供了有效途径。

Abstract: LLM web agents now browse and take actions on the open web, yet current agent
evaluations are constrained to sandboxed environments or artificial tasks. We
introduce BrowserArena, a live open-web agent evaluation platform that collects
user-submitted tasks, runs Arena-style head-to-head comparisons, and uses
step-level human feedback to surface failure modes. Collecting and analyzing
step-level annotations on the agent traces, we identify three consistent
failure modes: captcha resolution, pop-up banner removal, and direct navigation
to URLs. By constructing targeted datasets to further study these tasks, we
discover variations in how different language models navigate these failure
modes. We find, for example, that o4-mini deploys a wider variety of strategies
to circumvent captcha resolution than other models and DeepSeek-R1 consistently
misleads users about captcha resolution. Our findings surface both the
diversity and brittleness of current web agents. More broadly, our benchmarking
methodology provides an approach to evaluating and understanding web agent
failure modes at scale.

Motivation: ShotBench作为电影摄影理解任务的综合基准存在评估可靠性问题，包括模糊的选项设计和模型推理不一致性，这限制了公平比较和未来进展。

Method: 通过一致的选项重构系统改进ShotBench，对ShotVL进行首次关键推理行为分析，并引入联合评估任务准确性和核心模型能力的扩展评估协议。

Conclusion: RefineShot基准解决了ShotBench的局限性，为电影摄影理解任务提供了更可靠和全面的评估框架，有助于推动该领域的进步。

Abstract: Cinematography understanding refers to the ability to recognize not only the
visual content of a scene but also the cinematic techniques that shape
narrative meaning. This capability is attracting increasing attention, as it
enhances multimodal understanding in real-world applications and underpins
coherent content creation in film and media. As the most comprehensive
benchmark for this task, ShotBench spans a wide range of cinematic concepts and
VQA-style evaluations, with ShotVL achieving state-of-the-art results on it.
However, our analysis reveals that ambiguous option design in ShotBench and
ShotVL's shortcomings in reasoning consistency and instruction adherence
undermine evaluation reliability, limiting fair comparison and hindering future
progress. To overcome these issues, we systematically refine ShotBench through
consistent option restructuring, conduct the first critical analysis of
ShotVL's reasoning behavior, and introduce an extended evaluation protocol that
jointly assesses task accuracy and core model competencies. These efforts lead
to RefineShot, a refined and expanded benchmark that enables more reliable
assessment and fosters future advances in cinematography understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs虽然能从少量上下文示例中学习新任务，但这种灵活性带来了安全隐患——恶意示例可能被注入而影响模型行为，需要内置防御机制。

Method: 定义零样本安全基线行为，应用分布自由风险控制，采用动态早期退出预测机制，忽略关注不安全输入的注意力头。

Result: 理论分析和实证结果表明，该方法能有效控制有害上下文示例的风险，同时在有益示例上实现显著的计算效率提升。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够在防御恶意输入的同时，保持对有益输入的效率优势，为LLM安全提供了有效的技术保障。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate a remarkable ability to learn new
tasks from a few in-context examples. However, this flexibility introduces
safety concerns: LLMs can be influenced by incorrect or malicious
demonstrations -- for example, if an adversary tampers with or injects harmful
examples without a human supervisor noticing. This motivates principled designs
in which the system itself includes built-in mechanisms to guard against such
attacks. We propose a novel approach to limit the degree to which harmful
demonstrations can degrade model performance. First, we define a baseline
``safe'' behavior for the model -- the model's performance given no in-context
demonstrations (zero-shot). Next, we apply distribution-free risk control
(DFRC) to control the extent to which in-context samples can decay performance
below zero-shot. We achieve this by leveraging dynamic early exit prediction,
ignoring later attention heads that attend the most to the unsafe inputs.
Finally, we propose modifications to DFRC that allow it to both control risk
for harmful inputs \textit{and} leverage performance and efficiency gains on
helpful inputs. We present both theoretical and empirical results showing that
our approach can effectively control risk for harmful in-context demonstrations
while simultaneously achieving substantial computational efficiency gains with
helpful demonstrations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型多模态模型展现出令人印象深刻的情境学习能力，但其支持任务学习的内在机制仍然不透明。研究旨在揭示这些模型如何处理空间关系知识。

Method: 使用因果中介分析识别影响关系预测的注意力头，提取多模态功能向量，并在保持模型参数冻结的情况下对这些向量进行微调。

Result: 提取的功能向量能提高零样本推理准确率，经过少量数据微调后显著优于情境学习基线，并能线性组合解决涉及未训练空间关系的类比问题。

Conclusion: 大型多模态模型在局部内部结构中编码空间关系知识，这些知识可以被系统提取和优化，有助于理解模型模块化并增强对关系推理的控制。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) demonstrate impressive in-context learning
abilities from limited multimodal demonstrations, yet the internal mechanisms
supporting such task learning remain opaque. Building on prior work of large
language models, we show that a small subset of attention heads in the
vision-language model OpenFlamingo-4B is responsible for transmitting
representations of spatial relations. The activations of these attention heads,
termed function vectors, can be extracted and manipulated to alter an LMM's
performance on relational tasks. First, using both synthetic and real image
datasets, we apply causal mediation analysis to identify attention heads that
strongly influence relational predictions, and extract multimodal function
vectors that improve zero-shot accuracy at inference time. We further
demonstrate that these multimodal function vectors can be fine-tuned with a
modest amount of training data, while keeping LMM parameters frozen, to
significantly outperform in-context learning baselines. Finally, we show that
relation-specific function vectors can be linearly combined to solve analogy
problems involving novel and untrained spatial relations, highlighting the
strong generalization ability of this approach. Our results show that LMMs
encode spatial relational knowledge within localized internal structures, which
can be systematically extracted and optimized, thereby advancing our
understanding of model modularity and enhancing control over relational
reasoning in LMMs.

Abstract: While agentic AI has advanced in automating individual tasks, managing
complex multi-agent workflows remains a challenging problem. This paper
presents a research vision for autonomous agentic systems that orchestrate
collaboration within dynamic human-AI teams. We propose the Autonomous Manager
Agent as a core challenge: an agent that decomposes complex goals into task
graphs, allocates tasks to human and AI workers, monitors progress, adapts to
changing conditions, and maintains transparent stakeholder communication. We
formalize workflow management as a Partially Observable Stochastic Game and
identify four foundational challenges: (1) compositional reasoning for
hierarchical decomposition, (2) multi-objective optimization under shifting
preferences, (3) coordination and planning in ad hoc teams, and (4) governance
and compliance by design. To advance this agenda, we release MA-Gym, an
open-source simulation and evaluation framework for multi-agent workflow
orchestration. Evaluating GPT-5-based Manager Agents across 20 workflows, we
find they struggle to jointly optimize for goal completion, constraint
adherence, and workflow runtime - underscoring workflow management as a
difficult open problem. We conclude with organizational and ethical
implications of autonomous management systems.

Abstract: Agentic systems enable the intelligent use of research tooling, augmenting a
researcher's ability to investigate and propose novel solutions to existing

extensive knowledge base to dispatch tool calls via Model Context Protocol
(MCP) to perform actions such as Thermo-Calc property diagram calculations and
lack of fusion process map generation. In addition, the multi-agent system
developed in this work is able to effectively reason through complex user
prompts and provide analysis on the printability of proposed alloys. These
agents can dynamically adjust their task trajectory to the outcomes of tool
call results, effectively enabling autonomous decision-making in practical

accelerate the task of alloy discovery within the field of additive
manufacturing and showcase the benefits of adopting this multi-agent system.

Conclusion: 本文为CSPP提供了多个RL方法的基准测试，同时提供了可重用的带起重机调度的Gym环境，为未来研究和实际部署奠定基础。

Abstract: Container stowage planning (CSPP) is a critical component of maritime
transportation and terminal operations, directly affecting supply chain
efficiency. Owing to its complexity, CSPP has traditionally relied on human
expertise. While reinforcement learning (RL) has recently been applied to CSPP,
systematic benchmark comparisons across different algorithms remain limited. To
address this gap, we develop a Gym environment that captures the fundamental
features of CSPP and extend it to include crane scheduling in both multi-agent
and single-agent formulations. Within this framework, we evaluate five RL
algorithms: DQN, QR-DQN, A2C, PPO, and TRPO under multiple scenarios of varying
complexity. The results reveal distinct performance gaps with increasing
complexity, underscoring the importance of algorithm choice and problem
formulation for CSPP. Overall, this paper benchmarks multiple RL methods for
CSPP while providing a reusable Gym environment with crane scheduling, thus
offering a foundation for future research and practical deployment in maritime
logistics.

Abstract: The integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into smart grids presents unique
opportunities to enhance both transportation systems and energy networks.
However, ensuring safe and interpretable interactions between drivers,
vehicles, and the surrounding environment remains a critical challenge. This
paper presents a multi-modal large language model (LLM)-based framework to
process multimodal sensor data - such as object detection, semantic
segmentation, and vehicular telemetry - and generate natural-language alerts
for drivers. The framework is validated using real-world data collected from
instrumented vehicles driving on urban roads, ensuring its applicability to
real-world scenarios. By combining visual perception (YOLOv8), geocoded
positioning, and CAN bus telemetry, the framework bridges raw sensor data and
driver comprehension, enabling safer and more informed decision-making in urban
driving scenarios. Case studies using real data demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in generating context-aware alerts for critical situations, such
as proximity to pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles. This paper
highlights the potential of LLMs as assistive tools in e-mobility, benefiting
both transportation systems and electric networks by enabling scalable fleet
coordination, EV load forecasting, and traffic-aware energy planning.

Motivation: 研究基础模型在处理需要同时推理多个模态的任务时的能力，特别是当不同模态之间存在冲突证据时，模型是否能进行联合推理来调和这些冲突。

Method: 通过设计跨模态冲突场景来测试模型表现，分析跨模态注意力不平衡现象，并提出通过在每个训练实例中显式组合多个模态的简单可扩展方法来缓解此问题。

Result: 模型在单模态冲突识别中达到90%准确率，但在跨模态冲突中降至3%。提出的方法显著减少了注意力不平衡，并在多个视觉语言基准测试中提升了性能。

Conclusion: 系统性地解决跨模态上下文对于构建可靠的基础模型至关重要，当前模型存在严重的跨模态注意力不平衡问题，需要通过显式的跨模态训练来改善。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) deployed in real-world tasks such as computer-use
agents must integrate diverse modalities. How good are FMs at performing joint
reasoning, simultaneously reasoning over multiple modalities, especially when
the modalities interact and relate to each other to form cross-modal context?
To better understand this problem, we study FMs on cross-modal conflicts:
scenarios where conflicting evidence is presented across modalities. This
allows us to examine whether FMs prioritize one modality over another or reason
jointly to reconcile the conflict. Our experiments reveal that FMs can
recognize conflicts in unimodal contexts, composed of a single modality, 90% of
the time, but the ratio falls as low as 3% when evidence is split across
modalities -- similar observations hold in cross-lingual contexts, composed of
multiple languages. We trace this failure to cross-modal attention imbalance,
showing that FMs exhibit extreme asymmetry in attention scores,
disproportionately prioritizing certain modalities. We show that cross-modal
attention imbalance does not go away by simply scaling up multimodal or
multilingual datasets blindly, since they lack training examples that
explicitly require cross-modal reasoning. We demonstrate that even a simple and
scalable method of explicitly combining multiple modalities within each
training instance significantly reduces attention imbalance. Reduced attention
imbalance directly translates to improved downstream performance on several
vision-language benchmarks. Our findings underscore the importance of
systematically addressing cross-modal contexts to build reliable foundation
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时扩展方法仅增加样本数量，但存在收益递减问题。发现不同温度能探索模型的不同推理潜力，需要更全面的扩展策略。

Method: 提出温度维度扩展方法，在不同采样温度下生成推理轨迹，并使用多温度投票机制来降低计算开销。

Result: 在多个模型和推理基准测试中，温度扩展相比单温度TTS额外提升7.3分，使基础模型性能接近RL训练模型水平。

Conclusion: 测试时扩展的潜力被低估，温度扩展是解锁基础模型潜在能力的简单有效方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can improve reasoning at inference time through
test-time scaling (TTS), where multiple reasoning traces are generated and the
best one is selected. Prior work shows that increasing the number of samples K
steadily improves accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that this trend does
not hold indefinitely: at large K, further scaling yields no gains, and certain
hard questions remain unsolved regardless of the number of traces.
Interestingly, we find that different sampling temperatures solve different
subsets of problems, implying that single-temperature scaling explores only
part of a model's potential. We therefore propose scaling along the temperature
dimension, which enlarges the reasoning boundary of LLMs. Averaged over Qwen3
(0.6B, 1.7B, 4B, 8B) and five representative reasoning benchmarks (AIME
2024/2025, MATH500, LiveCodeBench, Hi-ToM), temperature scaling yields an
additional 7.3 points over single-temperature TTS. Temperature scaling also
enables base models to reach performance comparable to reinforcement learning
(RL)-trained counterparts, without additional post-training. We further provide
a comprehensive analysis of this phenomenon and design a multi-temperature
voting method that reduces the overhead of temperature scaling. Overall, our
findings suggest that TTS is more powerful than previously thought, and that
temperature scaling offers a simple and effective way to unlock the latent
potential of base models.

### [70] [A Concept of Possibility for Real-World Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02655)
*Daniel G. Schwartz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的可能性概念作为Zadeh经典概念的替代，专注于现实事件的可能性计算，基于前提条件和约束条件的概率函数，适用于规划问题中的可行性评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 替代Zadeh于1978年提出的标准可能性概念，专注于现实事件的可能性建模，特别是规划问题中的可行性分析。

Method: 将事件视为具有促进发生的前提条件和阻碍发生的约束条件，通过前提条件成立概率和约束条件不成立概率的函数来计算事件可能性。

Result: 开发了一种新的可能性理论框架，能够评估多个规划方案中哪个最容易或最可行完成，并通过车辆路径规划示例进行了说明。

Conclusion: 这种新的可能性模型可能正确捕捉了人类关于规划的正常推理过程，具有在规划问题中应用的潜力，并提出了未来应用方向。

Abstract: This paper offers a new concept of {\it possibility} as an alternative to the
now-a-days standard concept originally introduced by L.A. Zadeh in 1978. This
new version was inspired by the original but, formally, has nothing in common
with it other than that they both adopt the {\L}ukasiewicz multivalent
interpretation of the logical connectives. Moreover, rather than seeking to
provide a general notion of possibility, this focuses specifically on the
possibility of a real-world event. An event is viewed as having prerequisites
that enable its occurrence and constraints that may impede its occurrence, and
the possibility of the event is computed as a function of the probabilities
that the prerequisites hold and the constraints do not. This version of
possibility might appropriately be applied to problems of planning. When there
are multiple plans available for achieving a goal, this theory can be used to
determine which plan is most possible, i.e., easiest or most feasible to
complete. It is speculated that this model of reasoning correctly captures
normal human reasoning about plans. The theory is elaborated and an
illustrative example for vehicle route planning is provided. There is also a
suggestion of potential future applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoMaAS是一个自进化的多智能体架构搜索框架，利用神经架构搜索原理自动发现最优智能体配置，通过动态操作员生命周期管理和自动化机器学习技术实现资源自适应分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多智能体系统自动化设计方法寻求单一解决方案，无法根据查询复杂度和领域需求自适应分配资源。

Method: 采用四个关键创新：基于性能-成本分析的自动操作员生成、融合和消除；动态成本感知优化与实时参数调整；在线反馈集成实现持续架构优化；通过决策追踪机制增强可解释性。

Result: 在六个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，AutoMaAS相比最先进方法实现了1.0-7.1%的性能提升，同时将推理成本降低了3-5%。

Conclusion: 该框架在数据集和LLM骨干网络上展现出优异的可迁移性，为大语言模型时代的自动化多智能体系统设计建立了新范式。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems powered by large language models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse domains, yet existing automated design
approaches seek monolithic solutions that fail to adapt resource allocation
based on query complexity and domain requirements. This paper introduces
AutoMaAS, a self-evolving multi-agent architecture search framework that
leverages neural architecture search principles to automatically discover
optimal agent configurations through dynamic operator lifecycle management and
automated machine learning techniques. Our approach incorporates four key
innovations: (1) automatic operator generation, fusion, and elimination based
on performance-cost analysis, (2) dynamic cost-aware optimization with
real-time parameter adjustment, (3) online feedback integration for continuous
architecture refinement, and (4) enhanced interpretability through decision
tracing mechanisms. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate
that AutoMaAS achieves 1.0-7.1\% performance improvement while reducing
inference costs by 3-5\% compared to state-of-the-art methods. The framework
shows superior transferability across datasets and LLM backbones, establishing
a new paradigm for automated multi-agent system design in the era of large
language models.

*Zhaorun Chen,Xun Liu,Mintong Kang,Jiawei Zhang,Minzhou Pan,Shuang Yang,Bo Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ARMs是一个自适应红队代理，通过推理增强的多步骤编排自动优化多样化红队策略，有效引发目标VLM的有害输出，在基准测试中攻击成功率平均超过基线52.1%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型(VLMs)的普及，其多模态接口引入了新的安全漏洞，现有红队方法要么局限于有限的对抗模式，要么依赖人工工程，缺乏对新兴真实世界VLM漏洞的可扩展探索。

Method: 提出11种新颖的多模态攻击策略，涵盖VLM的多样化对抗模式，通过模型上下文协议(MCP)集成17种红队算法，设计分层记忆和epsilon-greedy攻击探索算法来平衡攻击的多样性和有效性。

Result: 在实例和策略基准测试中达到最先进的攻击成功率，平均超过基线52.1%，在Claude-4-Sonnet上超过90%。构建了ARMs-Bench，包含30K+红队实例，涵盖51个风险类别。

Conclusion: ARMs显著提高了红队实例的多样性，揭示了VLM的新兴漏洞。使用ARMs-Bench进行安全微调可显著提高VLM的鲁棒性，同时保持其通用效用，为改进多模态安全对齐提供了可行指导。

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) gain prominence, their multimodal interfaces
also introduce new safety vulnerabilities, making the safety evaluation
challenging and critical. Existing red-teaming efforts are either restricted to
a narrow set of adversarial patterns or depend heavily on manual engineering,
lacking scalable exploration of emerging real-world VLM vulnerabilities. To
bridge this gap, we propose ARMs, an adaptive red-teaming agent that
systematically conducts comprehensive risk assessments for VLMs. Given a target
harmful behavior or risk definition, ARMs automatically optimizes diverse
red-teaming strategies with reasoning-enhanced multi-step orchestration, to
effectively elicit harmful outputs from target VLMs. We propose 11 novel
multimodal attack strategies, covering diverse adversarial patterns of VLMs
(e.g., reasoning hijacking, contextual cloaking), and integrate 17 red-teaming
algorithms into ARMs via model context protocol (MCP). To balance the diversity
and effectiveness of the attack, we design a layered memory with an
epsilon-greedy attack exploration algorithm. Extensive experiments on instance-
and policy-based benchmarks show that ARMs achieves SOTA attack success rates,
exceeding baselines by an average of 52.1% and surpassing 90% on
Claude-4-Sonnet. We show that the diversity of red-teaming instances generated
by ARMs is significantly higher, revealing emerging vulnerabilities in VLMs.
Leveraging ARMs, we construct ARMs-Bench, a large-scale multimodal safety
dataset comprising over 30K red-teaming instances spanning 51 diverse risk
categories, grounded in both real-world multimodal threats and regulatory
risks. Safety fine-tuning with ARMs-Bench substantially improves the robustness
of VLMs while preserving their general utility, providing actionable guidance
to improve multimodal safety alignment against emerging threats.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种约束中心架构，通过层级化结构空间和领域特定表示来规范LLMs，实现生产调度中可靠的自动化约束规范，显著优于纯LLM方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代制造业中APS系统至关重要，但将制造需求转化为正式约束仍依赖人工且劳动密集。虽然生成模型特别是LLMs在从异构制造数据自动生成约束方面有潜力，但直接应用面临自然语言歧义、非确定性输出和领域知识有限等挑战。

Method: 提出约束中心架构，通过三个层级的层级化结构空间组织，使用领域特定表示确保精度和可靠性，同时设计并部署自动化生产场景适配算法来为特定制造配置高效定制架构。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法成功平衡了LLMs的生成能力和制造系统的可靠性要求，在约束规范任务中显著优于纯LLM方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的约束中心架构能够有效规范LLMs，实现生产调度中可靠且自动化的约束规范，解决了纯LLM方法在制造领域应用的限制。

Abstract: Advanced Planning and Scheduling (APS) systems have become indispensable for
modern manufacturing operations, enabling optimized resource allocation and
production efficiency in increasingly complex and dynamic environments. While
algorithms for solving abstracted scheduling problems have been extensively
investigated, the critical prerequisite of specifying manufacturing
requirements into formal constraints remains manual and labor-intensive.
Although recent advances of generative models, particularly Large Language
Models (LLMs), show promise in automating constraint specification from
heterogeneous raw manufacturing data, their direct application faces challenges
due to natural language ambiguity, non-deterministic outputs, and limited
domain-specific knowledge. This paper presents a constraint-centric
architecture that regulates LLMs to perform reliable automated constraint
specification for production scheduling. The architecture defines a
hierarchical structural space organized across three levels, implemented
through domain-specific representation to ensure precision and reliability
while maintaining flexibility. Furthermore, an automated production scenario
adaptation algorithm is designed and deployed to efficiently customize the
architecture for specific manufacturing configurations. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed approach successfully balances the generative
capabilities of LLMs with the reliability requirements of manufacturing
systems, significantly outperforming pure LLM-based approaches in constraint
specification tasks.

TL;DR: 提出Node-wise Consistency Verification (NCV)框架，通过节点级一致性检查来验证大语言模型的多步推理，提高错误定位精度并减少token消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在验证多步推理时存在错误定位不精确和token成本高的问题，要么评估整个推理链导致注意力稀释，要么依赖昂贵的多重采样。

Method: 将推理链分解为相互连接的验证节点，通过轻量级二进制一致性检查在节点层面进行验证，避免不必要的长文本生成。

Result: 在公共数据集上，NCV相比基线方法F1分数提升10%到25%，同时比传统方法（如基于CoT的验证器）减少6到58倍的token使用量。

Conclusion: NCV提供了一个可扩展的解决方案，提高了LLM推理验证的可解释性和效率。

Abstract: Verifying multi-step reasoning in large language models is difficult due to
imprecise error localization and high token costs. Existing methods either
assess entire reasoning chains, suffering attention dilution, or rely on
expensive multi-sampling. We introduce Node-wise Consistency Verification
(NCV), a training-free framework that recasts verification as lightweight
binary consistency checks at the node level. By decomposing the chain of
thought into interconnected verification nodes, NCV precisely localizes errors
and avoids unnecessary long-form generation. Experiments demonstrate that our
approach enhances interpretability and efficiency, presenting a scalable
solution for reliable LLM reasoning verification. On public datasets, NCV
achieves a 10\% to 25\% improvement in F1 scores over baselines while utilizing
$6\times$~$58\times$ fewer tokens than traditional methods like CoT-based
verifiers.

TL;DR: TRACE是一个用于评估工具增强LLM代理性能的多维评估框架，通过证据库积累推理步骤知识，能够有效评估代理的推理轨迹，包括效率、幻觉和适应性等方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具增强基准测试主要依赖答案匹配评估，但随着解决用户请求所需步骤增加，需要超越最终答案来评估问题解决轨迹，包括效率、幻觉和适应性等被忽视的方面。

Method: 引入TRACE框架，通过证据库积累先前推理步骤的知识，实现代理推理轨迹的多方面分析和评估。创建元评估数据集，在现有基准上添加多样且有缺陷的轨迹，并标注多方面性能分数。

Result: TRACE能够准确评估复杂行为，具有可扩展性和成本效益，即使使用小型开源LLM也能有效工作。应用该方法评估代理在解决工具增强任务时产生的轨迹，提供了之前未报告的观察和见解。

Conclusion: TRACE框架为工具增强LLM代理提供了有效的多维评估方法，能够超越简单的答案匹配，全面评估代理的推理轨迹性能。

Abstract: Although recent tool-augmented benchmarks incorporate complex user requests
and diverse tools, the evaluation methods for most of them remain limited to
answer matching. However, as the number of steps required to resolve a user
request increases, a proper evaluation of an agent's performance must go beyond
the final answer to also assess the problem-solving trajectory, including
previously ignored aspects such as efficiency, hallucination, and adaptivity.
The most straightforward method for evaluating these aspects is to compare an
agent's trajectory with the ground-truth trajectory, but this approach is
fundamentally limited since annotating all valid ground-truth trajectories is
prohibitively expensive. However, a simple LLM-based evaluator struggles to
assess trajectories in detail without ground truth. To effectively evaluate the
agents in this manner, we introduce TRACE, a framework for the
multi-dimensional evaluation of tool-augmented LLM agent performance. By
incorporating an evidence bank, which accumulates knowledge gathered from
preceding reasoning steps, TRACE enables a multi-faceted analysis and
evaluation of an agent's reasoning trajectory effectively. To validate our
framework, we develop a new meta-evaluation dataset by augmenting existing
benchmarks with diverse and flawed trajectories, each labeled with
multi-faceted performance scores. Our results confirm that TRACE accurately
evaluates these complex behaviors in a scalable and cost-effective manner, even
with small open-source LLMs. Furthermore, we apply our method to evaluate the
trajectories that agents produce while solving tool-augmented tasks, presenting
previously unreported observations and their corresponding insights.

TL;DR: 论文质疑机器学习中的目标满足假设(OSA)，指出在现实条件下由于近似、估计和优化误差，模型无法完全满足指定目标函数，且开发者意图无法完美转化为形式化目标，导致目标错误指定不可避免。基于数学结果，这些差距在强优化压力下会引发Goodhart定律失效，因此需要对通用AI系统的优化设定原则性限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战机器学习中普遍但未经检验的目标满足假设，揭示在现实条件下模型无法完全满足指定目标函数的问题，并探讨这对AI系统安全性的影响。

Method: 采用学习范式无关的框架，分析近似误差、估计误差和优化误差如何导致系统性偏离预期目标，结合数学结果证明这些差距在强优化下会引发Goodhart定律失效。

Result: 证明目标满足假设在现实条件下必然失败，目标错误指定不可避免，且这些差距在强优化压力下会导致可预测且不可逆的失控风险。

Conclusion: 由于无法事先确定Goodhart失效点，必须对通用AI系统的优化设定原则性限制，否则持续优化将导致系统失控。

Abstract: A common but rarely examined assumption in machine learning is that training
yields models that actually satisfy their specified objective function. We call
this the Objective Satisfaction Assumption (OSA). Although deviations from OSA
are acknowledged, their implications are overlooked. We argue, in a
learning-paradigm-agnostic framework, that OSA fails in realistic conditions:
approximation, estimation, and optimization errors guarantee systematic
deviations from the intended objective, regardless of the quality of its
specification. Beyond these technical limitations, perfectly capturing and
translating the developer's intent, such as alignment with human preferences,
into a formal objective is practically impossible, making misspecification
inevitable. Building on recent mathematical results, absent a mathematical
characterization of these gaps, they are indistinguishable from those that
collapse into Goodhart's law failure modes under strong optimization pressure.
Because the Goodhart breaking point cannot be located ex ante, a principled
limit on the optimization of General-Purpose AI systems is necessary. Absent
such a limit, continued optimization is liable to push systems into predictable
and irreversible loss of control.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出BayesianRouter框架，通过结合离线RM强度学习和在线贝叶斯选择，动态选择奖励模型来提升大语言模型对齐质量，解决现有路由方法的冷启动和探索不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RLHF/RLAIF流程依赖单一奖励模型，限制了对齐质量并可能导致过拟合。现有RM路由方法存在冷启动和探索不足的问题。

Method: 提出混合路由框架：离线阶段训练多任务路由器估计每个RM的可靠性；在线阶段使用贝叶斯Thompson采样进行逐查询RM选择，用离线嵌入作为高斯先验初始化权重向量，并通过在线奖励自适应更新后验分布。

Result: 在指令跟随和推理基准测试中，BayesianRouter持续优于单个RM、RM集成和现有路由方法。

Conclusion: BayesianRouter通过有效结合离线和在线学习，显著提升了奖励模型路由的性能，为大语言模型对齐提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human or AI feedback (RLHF / RLAIF) has become
the standard paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs). However, most
pipelines rely on a single reward model (RM), limiting alignment quality and
risking overfitting. Recent work explores RM routing--dynamically selecting an
RM from a candidate pool to exploit complementary strengths while maintaining
$O(1)$ RM calls--but existing methods suffer from cold-start and insufficient
exploration. We propose BayesianRouter, a hybrid routing framework that
combines offline RM strengths learning with online Bayesian selection. In the
offline stage, a multi-task router is trained on preference data to estimate
per-RM reliability. In the online stage, a Bayesian Thompson sampling router
performs per-query RM selection, initializing RM-specific weight vectors with
offline embeddings as Gaussian priors and adaptively updating their posteriors
with online rewards to adapt to the evolving policy distribution. Extensive
experiments on instruction-following (AlpacaEval-2, Arena-Hard, MT-Bench) and
reasoning (GSM8K, MMLU) benchmarks show that BayesianRouter consistently
outperforms individual RMs, RM ensembling, and existing routing methods.

Motivation: 离散扩散模型（DDM）的优化面临挑战：非自回归范式使得重要性采样难以处理且rollout复杂，这困扰了如GRPO等强化学习方法。

Method: 首先澄清DDM的理论基础，构建能够捕捉有价值token波动的重要性估计器；然后为视觉序列精心定制rollout方法，产生多样化的完成结果和可靠的优化梯度。

Result: 在数学推理、编码和视觉生成基准测试中，MaskGRPO带来了更稳定和高效的更新，导致更强的推理性能和更好的生成质量。

Conclusion: 本研究确立了MaskGRPO作为一个系统性的策略优化方法，并且是离散化视觉扩散的首个实用方法。

Abstract: Optimizing discrete diffusion model (DDM) with rewards remains a challenge:
the non-autoregressive paradigm makes importance sampling intractable and
rollout complex, puzzling reinforcement learning methods such as Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this study, we introduce MaskGRPO, the first
viable approach to enable scalable multimodal reinforcement learning in
discrete diffusion with effective importance sampling and modality-specific
adaptations. To this end, we first clarify the theoretical foundation for DDMs,
which facilitates building an importance estimator that captures valuable token
fluctuation for gradient updates. We then delicately tailored the rollout
method for visual sequences, which yields diverse completions and reliable
optimization gradients. Upon math reasoning, coding, and visual generation
benchmarks, MaskGRPO brings more stable and efficient updates, leading to
stronger reasoning performance and better generation quality. This study
establishes MaskGRPO as a systematic policy optimization approach and the first
practical way for discretized visual diffusion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流的深度学习方法是黑盒系统，缺乏对其推理过程的解释，这限制了其可信度和采用。XAI方法旨在通过提供模型决策过程的解释来克服这一挑战，但这些方法往往基于技术背景开发者的假设，而这些假设可能存在问题。

Method: 研究可解释性方法在应用于AI系统时的本体论和认识论假设，即关于解释存在性和我们获取这些解释知识能力的假设。分析XAI方法中看似微小的技术变化如何对应于解释基础假设的重要差异。

Result: 分析显示，XAI方法中的技术选择反映了重要的哲学假设，忽略这些基础的本体-认识论范式在选择XAI方法时会带来风险。

Conclusion: 在选择XAI方法时需要考虑其基础的本体论和认识论假设，并根据不同应用领域的特点来选择和调整适当的方法，以确保解释的有效性和适用性。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is being applied in almost every field. At the
same time, the currently dominant deep learning methods are fundamentally
black-box systems that lack explanations for their inferences, significantly
limiting their trustworthiness and adoption. Explainable AI (XAI) methods aim
to overcome this challenge by providing explanations of the models' decision
process. Such methods are often proposed and developed by engineers and
scientists with a predominantly technical background and incorporate their
assumptions about the existence, validity, and explanatory utility of different
conceivable explanatory mechanisms. However, the basic concept of an
explanation -- what it is, whether we can know it, whether it is absolute or
relative -- is far from trivial and has been the subject of deep philosophical
debate for millennia. As we point out here, the assumptions incorporated into
different XAI methods are not harmless and have important consequences for the
validity and interpretation of AI explanations in different domains. We
investigate ontological and epistemological assumptions in explainability
methods when they are applied to AI systems, meaning the assumptions we make
about the existence of explanations and our ability to gain knowledge about
those explanations. Our analysis shows how seemingly small technical changes to
an XAI method may correspond to important differences in the underlying
assumptions about explanations. We furthermore highlight the risks of ignoring
the underlying onto-epistemological paradigm when choosing an XAI method for a
given application, and we discuss how to select and adapt appropriate XAI
methods for different domains of application.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然反事实解释在可解释AI中是强大工具，但在基于规则的智能环境领域尚无成熟的生成方法，需要开发专门的反事实解释框架。

Method: 开发了一个插件来扩展现有的智能环境解释引擎，实现了反事实解释的形式化和实现，并通过用户研究(N=17)评估反事实解释与传统因果解释的效果。

Result: 用户偏好高度依赖情境：因果解释因其语言简洁性和在时间压力情境下的优势而受青睐；反事实解释因其可操作内容，在用户想要解决问题时更受欢迎。

Conclusion: 本文为智能环境贡献了一种新的解释类型实践框架，并提供了经验证据来指导何时选择每种解释类型最有效。

Abstract: Explainability is increasingly seen as an essential feature of rule-based
smart environments. While counterfactual explanations, which describe what
could have been done differently to achieve a desired outcome, are a powerful
tool in eXplainable AI (XAI), no established methods exist for generating them
in these rule-based domains. In this paper, we present the first formalization
and implementation of counterfactual explanations tailored to this domain. It
is implemented as a plugin that extends an existing explanation engine for
smart environments. We conducted a user study (N=17) to evaluate our generated
counterfactuals against traditional causal explanations. The results show that
user preference is highly contextual: causal explanations are favored for their
linguistic simplicity and in time-pressured situations, while counterfactuals
are preferred for their actionable content, particularly when a user wants to
resolve a problem. Our work contributes a practical framework for a new type of
explanation in smart environments and provides empirical evidence to guide the
choice of when each explanation type is most effective.

Motivation: 评估AI系统是否真正具备类比推理能力，还是仅仅依赖统计捷径。通过故意省略训练数据中的结构规则，测试模型在遇到新规则时的泛化表现。

Method: 在Impartial-RAVEN数据集上，故意省略多个结构规则进行训练，然后评估序列到序列transformer模型和基于视觉的架构（如CoPINet和Dual-Contrast Network）在完整测试集上的表现。

Result: transformer模型在熟悉规则上表现强劲，但在面对新颖或省略规则时准确率急剧下降。token级准确率与完整答案准确率之间的差距凸显了当前方法的局限性。

Conclusion: 当前深度学习模型在抽象推理方面存在根本限制，需要超越模式识别、发展具备稳健抽象推理能力的架构。

Abstract: Analogical reasoning lies at the core of human cognition and remains a
fundamental challenge for artificial intelligence. Raven's Progressive Matrices
(RPM) serve as a widely used benchmark to assess abstract reasoning by
requiring the inference of underlying structural rules. While many vision-based
and language-based models have achieved success on RPM tasks, it remains
unclear whether their performance reflects genuine reasoning ability or
reliance on statistical shortcuts. This study investigates the generalization
capacity of modern AI systems under conditions of incomplete training by
deliberately omitting several structural rules during training. Both
sequence-to-sequence transformer models and vision-based architectures such as
CoPINet and the Dual-Contrast Network are evaluated on the Impartial-RAVEN
(I-RAVEN) dataset. Experiments reveal that although transformers demonstrate
strong performance on familiar rules, their accuracy declines sharply when
faced with novel or omitted rules. Moreover, the gap between token-level
accuracy and complete answer accuracy highlights fundamental limitations in
current approaches. These findings provide new insights into the reasoning
mechanisms underlying deep learning models and underscore the need for
architectures that move beyond pattern recognition toward robust abstract
reasoning.

We enhance CoELA, a framework designed for building Collaborative Embodied

our research by integrating speech capabilities, enabling seamless
collaborative voice-based interactions. Our findings highlight the
effectiveness of prompt optimisation in enhancing collaborative agent
performance; for example, our best combination improved the efficiency of the
system running with Gemma3 by 22% compared to the original CoELA system. In
addition, the speech integration provides a more engaging user interface for
iterative system development and demonstrations.

TL;DR: CoDA是一个多智能体系统，通过专门的LLM智能体进行元数据分析、任务规划、代码生成和自我反思，显著提升了自然语言查询到可视化的自动化效果。

Abstract: Deep research has revolutionized data analysis, yet data scientists still
devote substantial time to manually crafting visualizations, highlighting the
need for robust automation from natural language queries. However, current
systems struggle with complex datasets containing multiple files and iterative
refinement. Existing approaches, including simple single- or multi-agent
systems, often oversimplify the task, focusing on initial query parsing while
failing to robustly manage data complexity, code errors, or final visualization
quality. In this paper, we reframe this challenge as a collaborative
multi-agent problem. We introduce CoDA, a multi-agent system that employs
specialized LLM agents for metadata analysis, task planning, code generation,
and self-reflection. We formalize this pipeline, demonstrating how
metadata-focused analysis bypasses token limits and quality-driven refinement
ensures robustness. Extensive evaluations show CoDA achieves substantial gains
in the overall score, outperforming competitive baselines by up to 41.5%. This
work demonstrates that the future of visualization automation lies not in
isolated code generation but in integrated, collaborative agentic workflows.

Motivation: 连续扩散模型理论上比离散扩散模型和循环变换器具有更强的表达能力，但在实践中表现不佳，主要原因是连续表示空间到离散标记空间的解码困难。

Method: 提出CCDD方法，在连续表示空间和离散标记空间的联合空间上定义多模态扩散过程，使用单一模型同时进行联合空间去噪，结合两种模态的优势。

Result: CCDD在真实世界语言建模任务中展现出强大的实证性能，具有丰富的潜在空间语义和良好的训练性与样本质量。

Conclusion: 通过联合连续和离散空间的扩散过程，CCDD成功解决了连续扩散模型在语言建模中的训练挑战，实现了理论表达能力与实证性能的统一。

Abstract: Diffusion language models, especially masked discrete diffusion models, have
achieved great success recently. While there are some theoretical and primary
empirical results showing the advantages of latent reasoning with looped
transformers or continuous chain-of-thoughts, continuous diffusion models
typically underperform their discrete counterparts. In this paper, we argue
that diffusion language models do not necessarily need to be in the discrete
space. In particular, we prove that continuous diffusion models have stronger
expressivity than discrete diffusions and looped transformers. We attribute the
contradiction between the theoretical expressiveness and empirical performance
to their practical trainability: while continuous diffusion provides
intermediate supervision that looped transformers lack, they introduce
additional difficulty decoding tokens into the discrete token space from the
continuous representation space. We therefore propose Coevolutionary Continuous
Discrete Diffusion (CCDD), which defines a joint multimodal diffusion process
on the union of a continuous representation space and a discrete token space,
leveraging a single model to simultaneously denoise in the joint space. By
combining two modalities, CCDD is expressive with rich semantics in the latent
space, as well as good trainability and sample quality with the help of
explicit discrete tokens. We also propose effective architectures and advanced
training/sampling techniques for CCDD, which reveals strong empirical
performance in extensive language modeling experiments on real-world tasks.

Abstract: We propose the Extended Reality Universal Planning Toolkit (ERUPT), an
extended reality (XR) system for interactive motion planning. Our system allows
users to create and dy- namically reconfigure environments while they plan
robot paths. In immersive three-dimensional XR environments, users gain a
greater spatial understanding. XR also unlocks a broader range of natural
interaction capabilities, allowing users to grab and adjust objects in the
environment similarly to the real world, rather than using a mouse and keyboard
with the scene projected onto a two-dimensional computer screen. Our system
integrates with MoveIt, a manipulation planning framework, allowing users to
send motion planning requests and visualize the resulting robot paths in
virtual or augmented reality. We provide a broad range of interaction
modalities, allowing users to modify objects in the environment and interact
with a virtual robot. Our system allows operators to visualize robot motions,
ensuring desired behavior as it moves throughout the environment, without risk
of collisions within a virtual space, and to then deploy planned paths on
physical robots in the real world.

Abstract: Driving scene manipulation with sensor data is emerging as a promising
alternative to traditional virtual driving simulators. However, existing
frameworks struggle to generate realistic scenarios efficiently due to limited
editing capabilities. To address these challenges, we present SIMSplat, a
predictive driving scene editor with language-aligned Gaussian splatting. As a
language-controlled editor, SIMSplat enables intuitive manipulation using
natural language prompts. By aligning language with Gaussian-reconstructed
scenes, it further supports direct querying of road objects, allowing precise
and flexible editing. Our method provides detailed object-level editing,
including adding new objects and modifying the trajectories of both vehicles
and pedestrians, while also incorporating predictive path refinement through
multi-agent motion prediction to generate realistic interactions among all
agents in the scene. Experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate SIMSplat's
extensive editing capabilities and adaptability across a wide range of

TL;DR: U-LAG是一个中间执行目标重定向层，能够在感知延迟、噪声或过时的情况下重新调整任务目标，而无需改变底层控制器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人在变化环境中操作时，必须处理延迟、噪声或过时的感知信息，这会影响任务执行的准确性。

Method: 提出UAR-PF不确定性感知重定向器，维护物体姿态分布以应对感知延迟，并选择最大化预期进展的目标。

Result: 在0-10厘米偏移和0-400毫秒延迟的测试中，UAR-PF和ICP相比无重定向基线表现更好，成功率高且末端执行器移动距离短。

Conclusion: U-LAG提供了一个可插拔的重定向接口，能够有效处理感知延迟问题，提高机器人在动态环境中的操作性能。

Abstract: Robots manipulating in changing environments must act on percepts that are
late, noisy, or stale. We present U-LAG, a mid-execution goal-retargeting layer
that leaves the low-level controller unchanged while re-aiming task goals
(pre-contact, contact, post) as new observations arrive. Unlike motion
retargeting or generic visual servoing, U-LAG treats in-flight goal re-aiming
as a first-class, pluggable module between perception and control. Our main
technical contribution is UAR-PF, an uncertainty-aware retargeter that
maintains a distribution over object pose under sensing lag and selects goals
that maximize expected progress. We instantiate a reproducible Shift x Lag
stress test in PyBullet/PandaGym for pick, push, stacking, and peg insertion,
where the object undergoes abrupt in-plane shifts while synthetic perception
lag is injected during approach. Across 0-10 cm shifts and 0-400 ms lags,
UAR-PF and ICP degrade gracefully relative to a no-retarget baseline, achieving
higher success with modest end-effector travel and fewer aborts; simple
operational safeguards further improve stability. Contributions: (1) UAR-PF for
lag-adaptive, uncertainty-aware goal retargeting; (2) a pluggable retargeting
interface; and (3) a reproducible Shift x Lag benchmark with evaluation on
pick, push, stacking, and peg insertion.

online imitation pretraining with offline finetuning. By leveraging online

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Koopman方法仅关注系统动力学的线性化，而本文旨在为包含非线性机器人动力学和避障约束的最优路径规划问题寻找全局线性表示，以提高计算效率。

Method: 使用扩展动态模式分解从输入状态数据中识别线性和双线性Koopman实现，在提升空间中制定二次规划问题，并在MPC框架中确定最优机器人动作。

Result: 开环分析表明只有双线性Koopman模型能准确捕捉非线性状态-输入耦合和避障所需的二次项，计算速度比传统非线性MPC快320倍。

Conclusion: 双线性Koopman实现对于具有非线性状态和输入约束的高度非线性最优控制问题的线性化具有重要潜力，可实现接近线性问题的计算效率。

Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven model predictive control framework for
mobile robots navigating in dynamic environments, leveraging Koopman operator
theory. Unlike the conventional Koopman-based approaches that focus on the
linearization of system dynamics only, our work focuses on finding a global
linear representation for the optimal path planning problem that includes both
the nonlinear robot dynamics and collision-avoidance constraints. We deploy
extended dynamic mode decomposition to identify linear and bilinear Koopman
realizations from input-state data. Our open-loop analysis demonstrates that
only the bilinear Koopman model can accurately capture nonlinear state-input
couplings and quadratic terms essential for collision avoidance, whereas linear
realizations fail to do so. We formulate a quadratic program for the robot path
planning in the presence of moving obstacles in the lifted space and determine
the optimal robot action in an MPC framework. Our approach is capable of
finding the safe optimal action 320 times faster than a nonlinear MPC
counterpart that solves the path planning problem in the original state space.
Our work highlights the potential of bilinear Koopman realizations for
linearization of highly nonlinear optimal control problems subject to nonlinear
state and input constraints to achieve computational efficiency similar to
linear problems.

Method: 提出SubSense框架，集成非侵入式反馈接口到1-DOF机械臂，与操作者手套配对提供触觉反馈和抓取状态，并开发端到端软件管理控制输入和通过VR平台显示沉浸式摄像头视图。

Result: 通过综合实验和用户研究验证了系统有效性，相比传统远程操作界面，在精细操作任务中表现更佳。

Conclusion: 多感官反馈在沉浸式虚拟环境中具有显著潜力，能够显著改善远程情境感知和任务性能，为现场ROV操作提供更直观和易用的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of haptic feedback and virtual
reality (VR) control interfaces to enhance teleoperation and telemanipulation
of underwater ROVs (remotely operated vehicles). Traditional ROV teleoperation
relies on low-resolution 2D camera feeds and lacks immersive and sensory
feedback, which diminishes situational awareness in complex subsea
environments. We propose SubSense -- a novel VR-Haptic framework incorporating
a non-invasive feedback interface to an otherwise 1-DOF (degree of freedom)
manipulator, which is paired with the teleoperator's glove to provide haptic
feedback and grasp status. Additionally, our framework integrates end-to-end
software for managing control inputs and displaying immersive camera views
through a VR platform. We validate the system through comprehensive experiments
and user studies, demonstrating its effectiveness over conventional
teleoperation interfaces, particularly for delicate manipulation tasks. Our
results highlight the potential of multisensory feedback in immersive virtual
environments to significantly improve remote situational awareness and mission
performance, offering more intuitive and accessible ROV operations in the
field.

Motivation: 解决将通用视觉运动策略转移到受约束机器人系统时，由于控制和机器人动力学不匹配导致的分布外行为和执行效果差的问题。

Method: 提出Embodiment-Aware Diffusion Policy (EADP)，在推理时将高层UMI策略与低层特定机器人控制器耦合，通过控制器跟踪成本的梯度反馈引导扩散采样过程生成动态可行的轨迹。

Conclusion: 该方法为在不同（甚至是高度受约束的）机器人系统上扩展通用操作技能提供了一条实用途径。

Abstract: We introduce UMI-on-Air, a framework for embodiment-aware deployment of
embodiment-agnostic manipulation policies. Our approach leverages diverse,
unconstrained human demonstrations collected with a handheld gripper (UMI) to
train generalizable visuomotor policies. A central challenge in transferring
these policies to constrained robotic embodiments-such as aerial
manipulators-is the mismatch in control and robot dynamics, which often leads
to out-of-distribution behaviors and poor execution. To address this, we
propose Embodiment-Aware Diffusion Policy (EADP), which couples a high-level
UMI policy with a low-level embodiment-specific controller at inference time.
By integrating gradient feedback from the controller's tracking cost into the
diffusion sampling process, our method steers trajectory generation towards
dynamically feasible modes tailored to the deployment embodiment. This enables
plug-and-play, embodiment-aware trajectory adaptation at test time. We validate
our approach on multiple long-horizon and high-precision aerial manipulation
tasks, showing improved success rates, efficiency, and robustness under
disturbances compared to unguided diffusion baselines. Finally, we demonstrate
deployment in previously unseen environments, using UMI demonstrations
collected in the wild, highlighting a practical pathway for scaling
generalizable manipulation skills across diverse-and even highly
constrained-embodiments. All code, data, and checkpoints will be publicly
released after acceptance. Result videos can be found at umi-on-air.github.io.

Conclusion: 提出的模块化框架在ROS平台上实现，能够有效处理动态环境，提供竞争性的定位精度，同时保持近实时运行。

Abstract: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) plays an important role in many
robotics fields, including social robots. Many of the available visual SLAM
methods are based on the assumption of a static world and struggle in dynamic
environments. In the current study, we introduce a real-time semantic RGBD SLAM
approach designed specifically for dynamic environments. Our proposed system
can effectively detect moving objects and maintain a static map to ensure
robust camera tracking. The key innovation of our approach is the incorporation
of deep learning-based semantic information into SLAM systems to mitigate the
impact of dynamic objects. Additionally, we enhance the semantic segmentation
process by integrating an Extended Kalman filter to identify dynamic objects
that may be temporarily idle. We have also implemented a generative network to
fill in the missing regions of input images belonging to dynamic objects. This
highly modular framework has been implemented on the ROS platform and can
achieve around 22 fps on a GTX1080. Benchmarking the developed pipeline on
dynamic sequences from the TUM dataset suggests that the proposed approach
delivers competitive localization error in comparison with the state-of-the-art
methods, all while operating in near real-time. The source code is publicly

Abstract: This paper proposes an algorithm capable of driving a system to follow a
piecewise linear trajectory without prior knowledge of the system dynamics.
Motivated by a critical failure scenario in which a system can experience an
abrupt change in its dynamics, we demonstrate that it is possible to follow a
set of waypoints comprised of states analytically proven to be reachable
despite not knowing the system dynamics. The proposed algorithm first applies
small perturbations to locally learn the system dynamics around the current
state, then computes the set of states that are provably reachable using the
locally learned dynamics and their corresponding maximum growth-rate bounds,
and finally synthesizes a control action that navigates the system to a
guaranteed reachable state.

Abstract: Rigid-formation navigation of multiple robots is essential for applications
such as cooperative transportation. This process involves a team of
collaborative robots maintaining a predefined geometric configuration, such as
a square, while in motion. For untethered collaborative motion, inter-robot
communication must be conducted through a wireless network. Notably, few
existing works offer a comprehensive solution for multi-robot formation
navigation executable on microprocessor platforms via wireless networks,
particularly for formations that must traverse complex curvilinear paths. To
address this gap, we introduce a novel "hold-and-hit" communication-control
framework designed to work seamlessly with the widely-used Robotic Operating
System (ROS) platform. The hold-and-hit framework synchronizes robot movements
in a manner robust against wireless network delays and packet loss. It operates
over discrete-time communication-control cycles, making it suitable for
implementation on contemporary microprocessors. Complementary to hold-and-hit,
we propose an intra-cycle optimization approach that enables rigid formations
to closely follow desired curvilinear paths, even under the nonholonomic
movement constraints inherent to most vehicular robots. The combination of
hold-and-hit and intra-cycle optimization ensures precise and reliable
navigation even in challenging scenarios. Simulations in a virtual environment
demonstrate the superiority of our method in maintaining a four-robot square
formation along an S-shaped path, outperforming two existing approaches.
Furthermore, real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of our
framework: the robots maintained an inter-distance error within $\pm 0.069m$
and an inter-angular orientation error within $\pm19.15^{\circ}$ while
navigating along an S-shaped path at a fixed linear velocity of $0.1 m/s$.

TL;DR: 提出一种新的轨迹生成框架，通过结构化网格表示和基于行为的生成机制，增强场景密度和行为多样性，解决现有数据集长尾分布问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轨迹预测基准数据集存在明显的长尾分布问题，大部分样本来自低密度场景和简单直线驾驶行为，缺乏高密度场景和安全关键操作（如变道、超车、转弯）的充分表示，这阻碍了模型泛化能力并导致过于乐观的评估。

Result: 在大规模Argoverse 1和Argoverse 2数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著提高了智能体密度和行为多样性，同时保持了运动真实性和场景级安全性；合成数据有利于下游轨迹预测模型，并增强了在挑战性高密度场景中的性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的轨迹生成框架能够合成现实的高密度场景和复杂交互的罕见行为，有效解决了现有数据集的长尾分布问题，为自动驾驶轨迹预测提供了更全面的训练和评估数据。

Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction is fundamental to autonomous driving, as it
underpins safe motion planning and collision avoidance in complex environments.
However, existing benchmark datasets suffer from a pronounced long-tail
distribution problem, with most samples drawn from low-density scenarios and
simple straight-driving behaviors. This underrepresentation of high-density
scenarios and safety critical maneuvers such as lane changes, overtaking and
turning is an obstacle to model generalization and leads to overly optimistic
evaluations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel trajectory
generation framework that simultaneously enhances scenarios density and
enriches behavioral diversity. Specifically, our approach converts continuous
road environments into a structured grid representation that supports
fine-grained path planning, explicit conflict detection, and multi-agent
coordination. Built upon this representation, we introduce behavior-aware
generation mechanisms that combine rule-based decision triggers with
Frenet-based trajectory smoothing and dynamic feasibility constraints. This
design allows us to synthesize realistic high-density scenarios and rare
behaviors with complex interactions that are often missing in real data.
Extensive experiments on the large-scale Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets
demonstrate that our method significantly improves both agent density and
behavior diversity, while preserving motion realism and scenario-level safety.
Our synthetic data also benefits downstream trajectory prediction models and
enhances performance in challenging high-density scenarios.

variants, work well for small-scale maps but fail to address large-scale ones
due to high search time and memory consumption. Recently, Large Language Models
(LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in path planning but still suffer from
spatial illusion and poor planning performance. Among all the works, LLM-A*
\cite{meng2024llm} leverages LLM to generate a series of waypoints and then
uses A* to plan the paths between the neighboring waypoints. In this way, the
complete path is constructed. However, LLM-A* still suffers from high
computational time for large-scale maps. To fill this gap, we conducted a deep
investigation into LLM-A* and found its bottleneck, resulting in limited
performance. Accordingly, we design an innovative LLM-enhanced algorithm, abbr.
as iLLM-A*. iLLM-A* includes 3 carefully designed mechanisms, including the
optimization of A*, an incremental learning method for LLM to generate
high-quality waypoints, and the selection of the appropriate waypoints for A*
for path planning. Finally, a comprehensive evaluation on various grid maps
shows that, compared with LLM-A*, iLLM-A* \textbf{1) achieves more than
$1000\times$ speedup on average, and up to $2349.5\times$ speedup in the
extreme case, 2) saves up to $58.6\%$ of the memory cost, 3) achieves both
obviously shorter path length and lower path length standard deviation.}

TL;DR: 提出了一种两阶段检索优化方法CGRS，通过智能重排序增强基线模型的粗粒度排名，在RoboSense 2025挑战赛中取得TOP-2成绩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决跨模态无人机导航中自然语言描述与视觉内容之间的细粒度语义匹配问题，特别是在复杂空中场景下，现有基线方法难以实现精确的语义匹配。

Method: 首先使用基线模型获取前20个最相关图像的初始粗排名，然后利用视觉语言模型为候选图像生成详细描述，最后通过多模态相似度计算框架进行细粒度重排序。

Result: 在所有关键指标（Recall@1、Recall@5、Recall@10）上相比基线方法实现了5%的稳定提升。

Conclusion: 该方法通过语义细化策略在实际机器人导航场景中具有实用价值，证明了语义桥接在跨模态检索中的有效性。

Abstract: Cross-modal drone navigation remains a challenging task in robotics,
requiring efficient retrieval of relevant images from large-scale databases
based on natural language descriptions. The RoboSense 2025 Track 4 challenge
addresses this challenge, focusing on robust, natural language-guided
cross-view image retrieval across multiple platforms (drones, satellites, and
ground cameras). Current baseline methods, while effective for initial
retrieval, often struggle to achieve fine-grained semantic matching between
text queries and visual content, especially in complex aerial scenes. To
address this challenge, we propose a two-stage retrieval refinement method:
Caption-Guided Retrieval System (CGRS) that enhances the baseline coarse
ranking through intelligent reranking. Our method first leverages a baseline
model to obtain an initial coarse ranking of the top 20 most relevant images
for each query. We then use Vision-Language-Model (VLM) to generate detailed
captions for these candidate images, capturing rich semantic descriptions of
their visual content. These generated captions are then used in a multimodal
similarity computation framework to perform fine-grained reranking of the
original text query, effectively building a semantic bridge between the visual
content and natural language descriptions. Our approach significantly improves
upon the baseline, achieving a consistent 5\% improvement across all key
metrics (Recall@1, Recall@5, and Recall@10). Our approach win TOP-2 in the
challenge, demonstrating the practical value of our semantic refinement
strategy in real-world robotic navigation scenarios.

Motivation: 当前视觉运动策略在处理接触丰富的机器人操作任务时忽视顺应性和力信息，导致接触力过大或行为脆弱。引入力信息可改善接触感知，但需要大量数据，而仿真数据生成又面临Sim2Real差距问题

Method: 开发了一个框架，通过单次人类演示生成力信息仿真数据，并与顺应性策略耦合来训练视觉运动策略

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效利用仿真生成的数据提升视觉运动策略在接触丰富任务中的性能，解决了数据稀缺和Sim2Real差距问题

Abstract: While visuomotor policy has made advancements in recent years, contact-rich
tasks still remain a challenge. Robotic manipulation tasks that require
continuous contact demand explicit handling of compliance and force. However,
most visuomotor policies ignore compliance, overlooking the importance of
physical interaction with the real world, often leading to excessive contact
forces or fragile behavior under uncertainty. Introducing force information
into vision-based imitation learning could help improve awareness of contacts,
but could also require a lot of data to perform well. One remedy for data
scarcity is to generate data in simulation, yet computationally taxing
processes are required to generate data good enough not to suffer from the
Sim2Real gap. In this work, we introduce a framework for generating
force-informed data in simulation, instantiated by a single human
demonstration, and show how coupling with a compliant policy improves the
performance of a visuomotor policy learned from synthetic data. We validate our
approach on real-robot tasks, including non-prehensile block flipping and a
bi-manual object moving, where the learned policy exhibits reliable contact
maintenance and adaptation to novel conditions. Project Website:

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究了视觉语言模型在工作区轨迹规划中的表现，发现主流VLMs在68.0%的情况下无法生成正确轨迹，并提出了REACT-Drive框架，通过检索增强生成技术将失败案例转化为约束规则，显著提升了轨迹规划性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型(VLMs)在自动驾驶中逐渐应用，但其在工作区(包含不规则布局、临时交通控制和动态几何结构)的轨迹规划能力尚未探索。工作区环境复杂多变，现有VLMs在此类场景中的表现存在明显不足。

Method: 提出REACT-Drive框架，结合检索增强生成(RAG)技术：1)通过子图挖掘和聚类分析识别失败模式；2)将先前的失败案例转化为约束规则和可执行代码；3)在新场景中检索相似模式来指导轨迹生成。

Result: 在ROADWork数据集上，REACT-Drive相比VLM基线将平均位移误差降低了约3倍，推理时间仅为0.58秒(远低于微调的17.90秒)。在15个真实工作区场景的实车实验中验证了其强实用性。

Conclusion: REACT-Drive通过将失败案例知识化并利用RAG技术，有效解决了VLMs在工作区轨迹规划中的局限性，显著提升了规划准确性和效率，具有重要的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs), with powerful multimodal reasoning
capabilities, are gradually integrated into autonomous driving by several
automobile manufacturers to enhance planning capability in challenging
environments. However, the trajectory planning capability of VLMs in work
zones, which often include irregular layouts, temporary traffic control, and
dynamically changing geometric structures, is still unexplored. To bridge this
gap, we conduct the \textit{first} systematic study of VLMs for work zone
trajectory planning, revealing that mainstream VLMs fail to generate correct
trajectories in $68.0%$ of cases. To better understand these failures, we first
identify candidate patterns via subgraph mining and clustering analysis, and
then confirm the validity of $8$ common failure patterns through human
verification. Building on these findings, we propose REACT-Drive, a trajectory
planning framework that integrates VLMs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG). Specifically, REACT-Drive leverages VLMs to convert prior failure cases
into constraint rules and executable trajectory planning code, while RAG
retrieves similar patterns in new scenarios to guide trajectory generation.
Experimental results on the ROADWork dataset show that REACT-Drive yields a
reduction of around $3\times$ in average displacement error relative to VLM
baselines under evaluation with Qwen2.5-VL. In addition, REACT-Drive yields the
lowest inference time ($0.58$s) compared with other methods such as fine-tuning
($17.90$s). We further conduct experiments using a real vehicle in 15 work zone
scenarios in the physical world, demonstrating the strong practicality of
REACT-Drive.

Motivation: 传统开环FES控制器使用固定刺激强度，存在过度刺激导致肌肉疲劳或刺激不足增加跌倒风险的问题。

Method: 开发闭环FES控制器，根据实时脚趾间隙动态调整刺激强度，在健康参与者中诱导足下垂，比较闭环与开环控制器在不同行走条件下的效果。

Result: 闭环控制器在保持足够脚趾间隙的同时，显著降低刺激强度，且不影响髋、膝、踝关节角度。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅匹配现有系统的有效性，还提供了减少肌肉疲劳、改善长期用户舒适度和依从性的潜力。

Abstract: Foot drop is commonly managed using Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES),
typically delivered via open-loop controllers with fixed stimulation
intensities. While users may manually adjust the intensity through external
controls, this approach risks overstimulation, leading to muscle fatigue and
discomfort, or understimulation, which compromises dorsiflexion and increases
fall risk. In this study, we propose a novel closed-loop FES controller that
dynamically adjusts the stimulation intensity based on real-time toe clearance,
providing "assistance as needed". We evaluate this system by inducing foot drop
in healthy participants and comparing the effects of the closed-loop controller
with a traditional open-loop controller across various walking conditions,
including different speeds and surface inclinations. Kinematic data reveal that
our closed-loop controller maintains adequate toe clearance without
significantly affecting the joint angles of the hips, the knees, and the
ankles, and while using significantly lower stimulation intensities compared to
the open-loop controller. These findings suggest that the proposed method not
only matches the effectiveness of existing systems but also offers the
potential for reduced muscle fatigue and improved long-term user comfort and
adherence.

Conclusion: 动作偏差感知混合推理能有效降低分布式AI推理的通信和计算开销，同时保持接近目标模型的性能，适用于延迟敏感的嵌入式AI应用。

Abstract: To support latency-sensitive AI applications ranging from autonomous driving
to industrial robot manipulation, 6G envisions distributed ML, connecting
distributed computational resources in edge and cloud over hyper-reliable
low-latency communication (HRLLC). In this setting, speculative decoding can
facilitate collaborative inference of models distributively deployed: an
on-device draft model locally generates drafts and a remote server-based target
model verifies and corrects them, resulting lower latency. However, unlike
autoregressive text generation, behavior cloning policies, typically used for
embodied AI applications like robot manipulation and autonomous driving, cannot
parallelize verification and correction for multiple drafts as each action
depends on observation which needs to be updated by a previous action. To this
end, we propose Action Deviation-Aware Hybrid Inference, wherein the draft
model estimates an action's need for verification and correction by the target
model and selectively skips communication and computation for server
operations. Action deviation shows a strong correlation with action's rejection
probability by the target model, enabling selective skipping. We derive the
path deviation threshold that balances the transmission rate and the inference
performance, and we empirically show that action deviation-aware hybrid
inference reduces uplink transmission and server operation by 40%, while
lowering end-to-end latency by 33.32% relative to hybrid inference without
skipping and achieving task success rate up to 97.03% of that of target model
only inference.

Motivation: 传统外部传感器（如激光雷达和相机）在恶劣能见度条件下感知环境困难，而超宽带雷达能够穿透不利环境条件（如灰尘、烟雾和雨水），但单次扫描无法重建详细图像。

Method: 通过移动机器人路径移动雷达合成虚拟大孔径，生成高分辨率合成孔径雷达图像，并评估SIFT、SURF、BRISK、AKAZE和ORB等经典特征检测器在UWB SAR图像上的回环检测性能。

Conclusion: UWB SAR成像能够为机器人感知系统提供更强大和可靠的解决方案，特别是在恶劣环境条件下。

Abstract: Traditional exteroceptive sensors in mobile robots, such as LiDARs and
cameras often struggle to perceive the environment in poor visibility
conditions. Recently, radar technologies, such as ultra-wideband (UWB) have
emerged as potential alternatives due to their ability to see through adverse
environmental conditions (e.g. dust, smoke and rain). However, due to the small
apertures with low directivity, the UWB radars cannot reconstruct a detailed
image of its field of view (FOV) using a single scan. Hence, a virtual large
aperture is synthesized by moving the radar along a mobile robot path. The
resulting synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image is a high-definition
representation of the surrounding environment. Hence, this paper proposes a
pipeline for mobile robots to incorporate UWB radar-based SAR imaging to map an
unknown environment. Finally, we evaluated the performance of classical feature
detectors: SIFT, SURF, BRISK, AKAZE and ORB to identify loop closures using UWB
SAR images. The experiments were conducted emulating adverse environmental
conditions. The results demonstrate the viability and effectiveness of UWB SAR
imaging for high-resolution environmental mapping and loop closure detection
toward more robust and reliable robotic perception systems.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel motion planning algorithm to facilitate
safety-critical navigation for autonomous mobile robots. The proposed algorithm
integrates a real-time dynamic obstacle tracking and mapping system that
categorizes point clouds into dynamic and static components. For dynamic point
clouds, the Kalman filter is employed to estimate and predict their motion
states. Based on these predictions, we extrapolate the future states of dynamic
point clouds, which are subsequently merged with static point clouds to
construct the forward-time-domain (FTD) map. By combining control barrier
functions (CBFs) with nonlinear model predictive control, the proposed
algorithm enables the robot to effectively avoid both static and dynamic
obstacles. The CBF constraints are formulated based on risk points identified
through collision detection between the predicted future states and the FTD
map. Experimental results from both simulated and real-world scenarios
demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm in complex environments. In
simulation experiments, the proposed algorithm is compared with two baseline
approaches, showing superior performance in terms of safety and robustness in
obstacle avoidance. The source code is released for the reference of the
robotics community.

Result: 当前指标能捕捉机器人导航行为的某些方面，但重要主观因素仍未被充分代表，需要新指标。

Abstract: Social, also called human-aware, navigation is a key challenge for the
integration of mobile robots into human environments. The evaluation of such
systems is complex, as factors such as comfort, safety, and legibility must be
considered. Human-centered assessments, typically conducted through surveys,
provide reliable insights but are costly, resource-intensive, and difficult to
reproduce or compare across systems. Alternatively, numerical social navigation
metrics are easy to compute and facilitate comparisons, yet the community lacks
consensus on a standard set of metrics.
  This work explores the relationship between numerical metrics and
human-centered evaluations to identify potential correlations. If specific
quantitative measures align with human perceptions, they could serve as
standardized evaluation tools, reducing the dependency on surveys. Our results
indicate that while current metrics capture some aspects of robot navigation
behavior, important subjective factors remain insufficiently represented and
new metrics are necessary.

Abstract: A complete mechatronic design of a minimal configuration brachiation robot is
presented. The robot consists of a single rigid rod with gripper mechanisms
attached to both ends. The grippers are used to hang the robot on a horizontal
bar on which it swings or rotates. The motion is imposed by repositioning the
robot's center of mass, which is performed using a crank-slide mechanism. Based
on a non-linear model, an optimal control strategy is proposed, for
repositioning the center of mass in a bang-bang manner. Consequently, utilizing
the concept of input-output linearization, a continuous control strategy is
proposed that takes into account the limited torque of the crank-slide
mechanism and its geometry. An increased attention is paid to energy
accumulation towards the subsequent jump stage of the brachiation. These two
strategies are validated and compared in simulations. The continuous control
strategy is then also implemented within a low-cost STM32-based control system,
and both the swing and rotation stages of the brachiation motion are
experimentally validated.

Abstract: Achieving precise lateral motion modeling and decoupled control in hover
remains a significant challenge for tail-sitter Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs), primarily due to complex aerodynamic couplings and the absence of
welldefined lateral dynamics. This paper presents a novel modeling and control
strategy that enhances yaw authority and lateral motion by introducing a
sideslip force model derived from differential propeller slipstream effects
acting on the fuselage under differential thrust. The resulting lateral force
along the body y-axis enables yaw-based lateral position control without
inducing roll coupling. The control framework employs a YXZ Euler rotation
formulation to accurately represent attitude and incorporate gravitational
components while directly controlling yaw in the yaxis, thereby improving
lateral dynamic behavior and avoiding singularities. The proposed approach is
validated through trajectory-tracking simulations conducted in a Unity-based
environment. Tests on both rectangular and circular paths in hover mode
demonstrate stable performance, with low mean absolute position errors and yaw
deviations constrained within 5.688 degrees. These results confirm the
effectiveness of the proposed lateral force generation model and provide a
foundation for the development of agile, hover-capable tail-sitter UAVs.

inertial measurement units (IMUs), optimized and calibrated with ground truth

angles estimated from accelerometer and gyroscope measurements acquired by
cost-effective IMUs. A complementary filter is employed to fuse the

(PSO) to mitigate noise and delay. To further improve estimation accuracy,
residual errors in position and orientation are compensated using radial basis
function neural networks (RBFNN). Experimental results validate the
effectiveness of the proposed intelligent multi-IMU kinematic estimation
method, achieving root mean square errors (RMSE) of 0.00021~m, 0.00041~m, and

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for real-time optimal controlling of a
heavy-duty skid-steered mobile platform for trajectory tracking. The importance
of accurate real-time performance of the controller lies in safety
considerations of situations where the dynamic system under control is affected
by uncertainties and disturbances, and the controller should compensate for
such phenomena in order to provide stable performance. A multiple-shooting
nonlinear model-predictive control framework is proposed in this paper. This
framework benefits from suitable algorithm along with readings from various
sensors for genuine real-time performance with extremely high accuracy. The
controller is then tested for tracking different trajectories where it
demonstrates highly desirable performance in terms of both speed and accuracy.
This controller shows remarkable improvement when compared to existing
nonlinear model-predictive controllers in the literature that were implemented
on skid-steered mobile platforms.

Abstract: Diffusion models, as a class of deep generative models, have recently emerged
as powerful tools for robot skills by enabling stable training with reliable
convergence. In this paper, we present an end-to-end framework for generating
long, smooth trajectories that explicitly target high surface coverage across
various industrial tasks, including polishing, robotic painting, and spray
coating. The conventional methods are always fundamentally constrained by their
predefined functional forms, which limit the shapes of the trajectories they
can represent and make it difficult to handle complex and diverse tasks.
Moreover, their generalization is poor, often requiring manual redesign or
extensive parameter tuning when applied to new scenarios. These limitations
highlight the need for more expressive generative models, making
diffusion-based approaches a compelling choice for trajectory generation. By
iteratively denoising trajectories with carefully learned noise schedules and
conditioning mechanisms, diffusion models not only ensure smooth and consistent
motion but also flexibly adapt to the task context. In experiments, our method
improves trajectory continuity, maintains high coverage, and generalizes to
unseen shapes, paving the way for unified end-to-end trajectory learning across
industrial surface-processing tasks without category-specific models. On
average, our approach improves Point-wise Chamfer Distance by 98.2\% and
smoothness by 97.0\%, while increasing surface coverage by 61\% compared to
prior methods. The link to our code can be found

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: HumanoidExo是一个将人类运动转换为全身人形机器人数据的新系统，解决了人形机器人策略学习中大规模数据集获取困难的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人形机器人策略学习面临大规模多样化数据集获取困难的问题，收集真实世界数据既困难又昂贵。

Method: 通过将人类运动转换为全身人形机器人数据，最小化人类演示者与机器人之间的体现差距，从而解决全身人形数据稀缺问题。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的真实世界任务中评估：桌面操作、结合站立-蹲下动作的操作以及全身操作。结果表明HumanoidExo能够使人形策略泛化到新环境，仅用5个真实机器人演示就能学习复杂的全身控制，甚至仅从HumanoidExo数据就能学习新技能（如行走）。

Conclusion: HumanoidExo是对真实机器人数据的重要补充，能够显著提升人形机器人在动态真实场景中的性能。

Abstract: A significant bottleneck in humanoid policy learning is the acquisition of
large-scale, diverse datasets, as collecting reliable real-world data remains
both difficult and cost-prohibitive. To address this limitation, we introduce
HumanoidExo, a novel system that transfers human motion to whole-body humanoid
data. HumanoidExo offers a high-efficiency solution that minimizes the
embodiment gap between the human demonstrator and the robot, thereby tackling
the scarcity of whole-body humanoid data. By facilitating the collection of
more voluminous and diverse datasets, our approach significantly enhances the
performance of humanoid robots in dynamic, real-world scenarios. We evaluated
our method across three challenging real-world tasks: table-top manipulation,
manipulation integrated with stand-squat motions, and whole-body manipulation.
Our results empirically demonstrate that HumanoidExo is a crucial addition to
real-robot data, as it enables the humanoid policy to generalize to novel
environments, learn complex whole-body control from only five real-robot
demonstrations, and even acquire new skills (i.e., walking) solely from
HumanoidExo data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于动态地图(MoDs)的长期人体运动预测框架，支持多种MoD类型并引入时间条件MoD，在60秒预测范围内显著优于基于学习的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长期人体运动预测对自主机器人和车辆在共享环境中的安全高效运行至关重要，需要准确预测来支持运动规划、人机交互等应用。

Method: 利用动态地图(MoDs)编码空间或时空运动模式作为环境特征，提出MoD-informed LHMP框架，支持多种MoD类型，包括时间条件MoD，并包含排序方法输出最可能的预测轨迹。

Result: 在两个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，MoD-informed方法优于基于学习的方法，平均位移误差改善高达50%，时间条件变体达到最高准确率。

Conclusion: 动态地图是长期人体运动预测的有效方法，时间条件MoD能捕捉不同时间段的变化模式，显著提升预测性能。

Abstract: Long-term human motion prediction (LHMP) is important for the safe and
efficient operation of autonomous robots and vehicles in environments shared
with humans. Accurate predictions are important for applications including
motion planning, tracking, human-robot interaction, and safety monitoring. In
this paper, we exploit Maps of Dynamics (MoDs), which encode spatial or
spatio-temporal motion patterns as environment features, to achieve LHMP for
horizons of up to 60 seconds. We propose an MoD-informed LHMP framework that
supports various types of MoDs and includes a ranking method to output the most
likely predicted trajectory, improving practical utility in robotics. Further,
a time-conditioned MoD is introduced to capture motion patterns that vary
across different times of day. We evaluate MoD-LHMP instantiated with three
types of MoDs. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that MoD-informed
method outperforms learning-based ones, with up to 50\% improvement in average
displacement error, and the time-conditioned variant achieves the highest
accuracy overall. Project code is available at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文主张在人形机器人中采用控制策略与物理结构的协同设计机制，通过模拟生物进化过程，使机器人能够同时优化形态和行为以适应特定任务和资源约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究主要关注固定结构机器人的控制策略优化，而忽略了物理形态的适应性。本文认为要实现真正的具身智能，必须同时进化控制策略和物理结构。

Method: 提出基于策略探索、Sim2Real迁移和元策略学习的实用协同设计方法，从方法论、应用驱动和社区导向三个角度分析协同设计的必要性。

Result: 确立了协同设计作为开发下一代智能自适应人形机器人基石的定位，提出了从短期创新到长期目标的开放研究问题。

Conclusion: 协同设计是实现真正具身智能和开发下一代智能自适应人形机器人的关键途径，需要学术界和工业界的共同努力。

Abstract: Humanoid robots, as general-purpose physical agents, must integrate both
intelligent control and adaptive morphology to operate effectively in diverse
real-world environments. While recent research has focused primarily on
optimizing control policies for fixed robot structures, this position paper
argues for evolving both control strategies and humanoid robots' physical
structure under a co-design mechanism. Inspired by biological evolution, this
approach enables robots to iteratively adapt both their form and behavior to
optimize performance within task-specific and resource-constrained contexts.
Despite its promise, co-design in humanoid robotics remains a relatively
underexplored domain, raising fundamental questions about its feasibility and
necessity in achieving true embodied intelligence. To address these challenges,
we propose practical co-design methodologies grounded in strategic exploration,
Sim2Real transfer, and meta-policy learning. We further argue for the essential
role of co-design by analyzing it from methodological, application-driven, and
community-oriented perspectives. Striving to guide and inspire future studies,
we present open research questions, spanning from short-term innovations to
long-term goals. This work positions co-design as a cornerstone for developing
the next generation of intelligent and adaptable humanoid agents.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 研究人员开发了一种仅重3.2克的胡须式触觉传感装置，使微型无人机能够在完全黑暗等恶劣环境中通过触觉感知进行导航和探索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微型飞行机器人在搜救、安全检查和环境监测方面潜力巨大，但小尺寸限制了传统传感能力，特别是在光线差、烟雾、灰尘或反光障碍物等条件下。受自然界启发，希望为微型无人机提供类似老鼠和鼹鼠胡须的触觉感知能力。

Method: 使用基于气压计的胡须传感器检测障碍物位置，同时最小化对飞行稳定性的影响。开发了触觉深度估计方法以解决传感器噪声和漂移问题，实现了亚6毫米精度。系统完全在192KB RAM的微控制器上运行，支持自主触觉飞行。

Result: 该系统使无人机能够在完全黑暗条件下仅通过触觉进行导航、轮廓障碍物和探索受限空间，无论是软表面还是刚性表面都能正常工作。在仿真和真实世界测试中均得到验证。

Conclusion: 这种仿生方法重新定义了无视觉导航，为微型飞行器在极端环境中的应用开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Tiny flying robots hold great potential for search-and-rescue, safety
inspections, and environmental monitoring, but their small size limits
conventional sensing-especially with poor-lighting, smoke, dust or reflective
obstacles. Inspired by nature, we propose a lightweight, 3.2-gram,
whisker-based tactile sensing apparatus for tiny drones, enabling them to
navigate and explore through gentle physical interaction. Just as rats and
moles use whiskers to perceive surroundings, our system equips drones with
tactile perception in flight, allowing obstacle sensing even in pitch-dark
conditions. The apparatus uses barometer-based whisker sensors to detect
obstacle locations while minimising destabilisation. To address sensor noise
and drift, we develop a tactile depth estimation method achieving sub-6 mm
accuracy. This enables drones to navigate, contour obstacles, and explore
confined spaces solely through touch-even in total darkness along both soft and
rigid surfaces. Running fully onboard a 192-KB RAM microcontroller, the system
supports autonomous tactile flight and is validated in both simulation and
real-world tests. Our bio-inspired approach redefines vision-free navigation,
opening new possibilities for micro aerial vehicles in extreme environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种从轨迹数据直接学习李雅普诺夫函数的新框架，无需系统动力学模型即可验证自主系统的稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统稳定性证书需要系统动力学知识，对于复杂未知系统难以实现。本文旨在开发数据驱动的稳定性认证方法。

Method: 使用神经网络参数化李雅普诺夫候选函数，通过Cholesky分解确保正定性，允许稳定性条件的受控违反以处理噪声数据。

Result: 框架能够提供数据驱动的稳定性保证，即使在系统行为不透明或专有的情况下也能应用。

Conclusion: 该方法为动态现实环境中的机器人系统安全认证提供了鲁棒方法，相关工具已开源。

Abstract: Stability certificates play a critical role in ensuring the safety and
reliability of robotic systems. However, deriving these certificates for
complex, unknown systems has traditionally required explicit knowledge of
system dynamics, often making it a daunting task. This work introduces a novel
framework that learns a Lyapunov function directly from trajectory data,
enabling the certification of stability for autonomous systems without needing
detailed system models. By parameterizing the Lyapunov candidate using a neural
network and ensuring positive definiteness through Cholesky factorization, our
approach automatically identifies whether the system is stable under the given
trajectory. To address the challenges posed by noisy, real-world data, we allow
for controlled violations of the stability condition, focusing on maintaining
high confidence in the stability certification process. Our results demonstrate
that this framework can provide data-driven stability guarantees, offering a
robust method for certifying the safety of robotic systems in dynamic,
real-world environments. This approach works without access to the internal
control algorithms, making it applicable even in situations where system
behavior is opaque or proprietary. The tool for learning the stability proof is
open-sourced by this research: https://github.com/HansOersted/stability.

*Tianyu Xu,Jiawei Chen,Jiazhao Zhang,Wenyao Zhang,Zekun Qi,Minghan Li,Zhizheng Zhang,He Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出MM-Nav视觉语言动作模型，通过师生学习方式从合成专家数据中学习多样化导航能力，在合成和真实环境中都表现出强大的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉导航策略使用自我中心视觉观察进行导航，但光学信息难以像LiDAR点云或深度图那样显式建模，需要智能模型和大规模数据。

Method: 基于预训练大语言模型和视觉基础模型实现多视图VLA模型MM-Nav，从三个具有特权深度信息的RL专家收集专家数据，在三个定制环境中训练不同导航能力：到达、挤压和避障，使用动态平衡的训练比例进行迭代训练。

Result: 在合成环境中表现出强大的泛化能力，学生VLA模型超越了RL教师，展示了整合多种能力的协同效应，真实世界实验进一步证实了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过师生学习方式整合多种导航能力的VLA模型能够实现强大的泛化性能，在合成和真实环境中都优于传统的RL专家方法。

Abstract: Visual navigation policy is widely regarded as a promising direction, as it
mimics humans by using egocentric visual observations for navigation. However,
optical information of visual observations is difficult to be explicitly
modeled like LiDAR point clouds or depth maps, which subsequently requires
intelligent models and large-scale data. To this end, we propose to leverage
the intelligence of the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model to learn diverse
navigation capabilities from synthetic expert data in a teacher-student manner.
Specifically, we implement the VLA model, MM-Nav, as a multi-view VLA (with 360
observations) based on pretrained large language models and visual foundation
models. For large-scale navigation data, we collect expert data from three
reinforcement learning (RL) experts trained with privileged depth information
in three challenging tailor-made environments for different navigation
capabilities: reaching, squeezing, and avoiding. We iteratively train our VLA
model using data collected online from RL experts, where the training ratio is
dynamically balanced based on performance on individual capabilities. Through
extensive experiments in synthetic environments, we demonstrate that our model
achieves strong generalization capability. Moreover, we find that our student
VLA model outperforms the RL teachers, demonstrating the synergistic effect of
integrating multiple capabilities. Extensive real-world experiments further
confirm the effectiveness of our method.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于无人机在电力网格场景中覆盖轨迹规划的两阶段最优平滑算法，通过遗传算法解决TSP问题生成初始访问序列，再优化轨迹平滑度、时间和避障约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对无人机在电力网格等复杂环境中的覆盖应用需求，需要规划既能高效覆盖所有兴趣点又满足平滑性、时间效率和避障要求的轨迹。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：前端使用遗传算法解决TSP问题优化访问序列；后端将轨迹平滑度、时间消耗和避障约束建模为非线性最小二乘问题进行求解。

Result: 数值仿真验证了算法的有效性，确保无人机能够在复杂环境中平滑覆盖所有兴趣点。

Conclusion: 该算法能够为无人机在电力网格等复杂场景中提供有效的平滑覆盖轨迹规划解决方案。

Abstract: For typical applications of UAVs in power grid scenarios, we construct the
problem as planning UAV trajectories for coverage in cluttered environments. In
this paper, we propose an optimal smooth coverage trajectory planning
algorithm. The algorithm consists of two stages. In the front-end, a Genetic
Algorithm (GA) is employed to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for
Points of Interest (POIs), generating an initial sequence of optimized visiting
points. In the back-end, the sequence is further optimized by considering
trajectory smoothness, time consumption, and obstacle avoidance. This is
formulated as a nonlinear least squares problem and solved to produce a smooth
coverage trajectory that satisfies these constraints. Numerical simulations
validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, ensuring UAVs can
smoothly cover all POIs in cluttered environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: VLMFP是一个双VLM引导的框架，能够自主生成PDDL问题文件和领域文件，解决视觉语言模型在空间和长时域推理方面的不足，同时结合PDDL规划器的形式化规划优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法结合视觉语言模型和PDDL规划器的互补优势，但视觉语言模型难以准确生成描述所有规划规则的PDDL领域文件，需要依赖人工预定义或持续环境访问进行优化。

Method: VLMFP引入两个VLM：SimVLM基于输入规则描述模拟动作后果，GenVLM通过比较PDDL和SimVLM执行结果来生成和迭代优化PDDL文件。

Result: 在6个网格世界领域测试中，SimVLM能准确描述95.5%（已知外观）和82.6%（未知外观）的场景，模拟85.5%和87.8%的动作序列，判断82.4%和85.6%的目标达成。VLMFP能为已知外观和未知外观的未知实例生成有效规划，分别达到70.0%和54.1%。

Conclusion: VLMFP能够自主生成PDDL问题文件和领域文件，在多个层面上实现泛化能力：同一生成的PDDL领域文件适用于同一问题下的所有不同实例，且VLM能泛化到具有不同外观和规则的问题。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) show strong potential for visual planning but
struggle with precise spatial and long-horizon reasoning. In contrast, Planning
Domain Definition Language (PDDL) planners excel at long-horizon formal
planning, but cannot interpret visual inputs. Recent works combine these
complementary advantages by enabling VLMs to turn visual planning problems into
PDDL files for formal planning. However, while VLMs can generate PDDL problem
files satisfactorily, they struggle to accurately generate the PDDL domain
files, which describe all the planning rules. As a result, prior methods rely
on human experts to predefine domain files or on constant environment access
for refinement. We propose VLMFP, a Dual-VLM-guided framework that can
autonomously generate both PDDL problem and domain files for formal visual
planning. VLMFP introduces two VLMs to ensure reliable PDDL file generation: A
SimVLM that simulates action consequences based on input rule descriptions, and
a GenVLM that generates and iteratively refines PDDL files by comparing the
PDDL and SimVLM execution results. VLMFP unleashes multiple levels of
generalizability: The same generated PDDL domain file works for all the
different instances under the same problem, and VLMs generalize to different
problems with varied appearances and rules. We evaluate VLMFP with 6 grid-world
domains and test its generalization to unseen instances, appearance, and game
rules. On average, SimVLM accurately describes 95.5%, 82.6% of scenarios,
simulates 85.5%, 87.8% of action sequence, and judges 82.4%, 85.6% goal
reaching for seen and unseen appearances, respectively. With the guidance of
SimVLM, VLMFP can generate PDDL files to reach 70.0%, 54.1% valid plans for
unseen instances in seen and unseen appearances, respectively. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于扩散模型ODE和SDE截断误差分析，开发无需额外训练的高效采样方法，解决扩散模型推理速度慢的问题

Method: 通过分析扩散ODE和SDE的截断误差，提出训练自由的采样算法，支持灵活引导尺度

Result: 在COCO 2014、COCO 2017和LAION数据集上，8步生成的FID性能分别为15.7、22.35和17.52，优于DPM++ 2m（20步）和AMED-plugin求解器；5步推理性能与SDXL-turbo（4步）和Flash Diffusion（5步）相当

Conclusion: 该算法首次实现8步内采样1024×1024图像且FID性能与最新蒸馏模型相当，无需额外训练，显著提升扩散模型推理效率

Abstract: The diffusion model is a state-of-the-art generative model that generates an
image by applying a neural network iteratively. Moreover, this generation
process is regarded as an algorithm solving an ordinary differential equation
or a stochastic differential equation. Based on the analysis of the truncation
error of the diffusion ODE and SDE, our study proposes a training-free
algorithm that generates high-quality 512 x 512 and 1024 x 1024 images in eight
steps, with flexible guidance scales. To the best of my knowledge, our
algorithm is the first one that samples a 1024 x 1024 resolution image in 8
steps with an FID performance comparable to that of the latest distillation
model, but without additional training. Meanwhile, our algorithm can also
generate a 512 x 512 image in 8 steps, and its FID performance is better than
the inference result using state-of-the-art ODE solver DPM++ 2m in 20 steps. We
validate our eight-step image generation algorithm using the COCO 2014, COCO
2017, and LAION datasets. And our best FID performance is 15.7, 22.35, and
17.52. While the FID performance of DPM++2m is 17.3, 23.75, and 17.33. Further,
it also outperforms the state-of-the-art AMED-plugin solver, whose FID
performance is 19.07, 25.50, and 18.06. We also apply the algorithm in
five-step inference without additional training, for which the best FID
performance in the datasets mentioned above is 19.18, 23.24, and 19.61,
respectively, and is comparable to the performance of the state-of-the-art AMED
Pulgin solver in eight steps, SDXL-turbo in four steps, and the
state-of-the-art diffusion distillation model Flash Diffusion in five steps. We
also validate our algorithm in synthesizing 1024 * 1024 images within 6 steps,
whose FID performance only has a limited distance to the latest distillation
algorithm. The code is in repo:

Abstract: The visualization of 3D point cloud data is essential in fields such as
autonomous navigation, environmental monitoring, and disaster response, where
tasks like object recognition, structural analysis, and spatiotemporal
exploration rely on clear and effective visual representation. Despite
advancements in AI-driven processing, visualization remains a critical tool for
interpreting complex spatial datasets. However, designing effective point cloud
visualizations presents significant challenges due to the sparsity, density
variations, and scale of the data. In this work, we analyze the design space of
spatial point cloud visualization, highlighting a gap in systematically mapping
visualization techniques to analytical objectives. We introduce a taxonomy that
categorizes four decades of visualization design choices, linking them to
fundamental challenges in modern applications. By structuring visualization
strategies based on data types, user objectives, and visualization techniques,
our framework provides a foundation for advancing more effective,
interpretable, and user-centered visualization techniques.

Abstract: Constructing and sharing 3D maps is essential for many applications,
including autonomous driving and augmented reality. Recently, 3D Gaussian
splatting has emerged as a promising approach for accurate 3D reconstruction.
However, a practical map-sharing system that features high-fidelity, continuous

We evaluate GS-Share against state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating that our
system achieves higher fidelity, particularly for extrapolated views, with
improvements of 11%, 22%, and 74% in PSNR, LPIPS, and Depth L1, respectively.
Furthermore, GS-Share is significantly more compact, reducing map transmission
overhead by 36%.
