To grow memory at low cost, we\nintroduce an auto-scaling data flywheel that (i) discovers new environments via\nsearch, (ii) synthesizes tasks with an open-source VLM, (iii) rolls out\ntrajectories with the agent, and (iv) verifies success with the same VLM. Using\nthis pipeline, we collect 100k+ trajectories for about \\$4000 and fine-tune\nonly the memory encoder (LoRA on a Q-Former, 1.2\\% parameters) with 1,500\nsamples. On real-world GUI benchmarks, our memory-augmented agent consistently\nimproves success rates under long horizons and distribution shifts.

Our core idea is to design a teacher model that\nextracts high-quality instance embeddings and distills its open-vocabulary\nknowledge into a 3D student model. In this way, during inference, the distilled\n3D model can directly classify instances from the 3D point cloud, avoiding\nnoise caused by occlusions and significantly accelerating the inference\nprocess.

We identify that the fundamental challenge extends beyond error\naccumulation to a critical discrepancy between the training assumption (seeing\nclean data) and the test-time autoregressive reality (conditioning on\nself-generated, error-prone outputs). To bridge this hypothesis gap, SVI\nincorporates Error-Recycling Fine-Tuning, a new type of efficient training that\nrecycles the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)'s self-generated errors into\nsupervisory prompts, thereby encouraging DiT to actively identify and correct\nits own errors.

We focus on the innovative application\nof Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the preliminary diagnosis of\nshoulder disorders and propose a Hybrid Motion Video Diagnosis framework\n(HMVDx). This framework divides the two tasks of action understanding and\ndisease diagnosis, which are respectively completed by two MLLMs. In addition\nto traditional evaluation indicators, this work proposes a novel metric called\nUsability Index by the logical process of medical decision-making (action\nrecognition, movement diagnosis, and final diagnosis). This index evaluates the\neffectiveness of MLLMs in the medical field from the perspective of the entire\nmedical diagnostic pathway, revealing the potential value of low-cost MLLMs in\nmedical applications for medical practitioners. In experimental comparisons,\nthe accuracy of HMVDx in diagnosing shoulder joint injuries has increased by\n79.6\\% compared with direct video diagnosis, a significant technical\ncontribution to future research on the application of MLLMs for video\nunderstanding in the medical field."}

We propose FIPER, a general\nframework for Failure Prediction at Runtime for generative IL policies that\ndoes not require failure data. FIPER identifies two key indicators of impending\nfailure: (i) out-of-distribution (OOD) observations detected via random network\ndistillation in the policy's embedding space, and (ii) high uncertainty in\ngenerated actions measured by a novel action-chunk entropy score. Both failure\nprediction scores are calibrated using a small set of successful rollouts via\nconformal prediction. A failure alarm is triggered when both indicators,\naggregated over short time windows, exceed their thresholds. We evaluate FIPER\nacross five simulation and real-world environments involving diverse failure\nmodes.

Training Gaussian\nmodels with partially initialized point clouds often leads to distortions and\nartifacts, as camera rays may fail to intersect valid surfaces, resulting in\nincorrect gradient propagation to Gaussian primitives associated with occluded\nor invisible geometry. Additionally, existing densification strategies simply\nclone and split Gaussian primitives from existing ones, incapable of\nreconstructing missing structures. To address these limitations, we propose\nVAD-GS, a 3DGS framework tailored for geometry recovery in challenging urban\nscenes. Our method identifies unreliable geometry structures via voxel-based\nvisibility reasoning, selects informative supporting views through\ndiversity-aware view selection, and recovers missing structures via patch\nmatching-based multi-view stereo reconstruction. This design enables the\ngeneration of new Gaussian primitives guided by reliable geometric priors, even\nin regions lacking initial points. Extensive experiments on the Waymo and\nnuScenes datasets demonstrate that VAD-GS outperforms state-of-the-art 3DGS\napproaches and significantly improves the quality of reconstructed geometry for\nboth static and dynamic objects.

This paper introduces a novel, adaptive background grid\nsimplification (ABGS) framework based on a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN).\nWe reformulate the grid simplification task as an edge score regression problem\nand train a GCN model to efficiently predict optimal edge collapse candidates.\nThe model is guided by a custom loss function that holistically considers both\ngeometric fidelity and sizing field accuracy. This data-driven approach\nreplaces a costly procedural evaluation, accelerating the simplification\nprocess.

Current state-of-the-art\napproaches, however, adopt modular architectures that separate navigation\nplanning from visual world modeling, leading to state-action misalignment and\nlimited adaptability in novel or dynamic scenarios. To overcome this\nfundamental limitation, we propose UniWM, a unified, memory-augmented world\nmodel integrating egocentric visual foresight and planning within a single\nmultimodal autoregressive backbone. Unlike modular frameworks, UniWM explicitly\ngrounds action decisions in visually imagined outcomes, ensuring tight\nalignment between prediction and control. A hierarchical memory mechanism\nfurther integrates detailed short-term perceptual cues with longer-term\ntrajectory context, enabling stable, coherent reasoning over extended horizons.\nExtensive experiments across four challenging benchmarks (Go Stanford, ReCon,\nSCAND, HuRoN) demonstrate that UniWM substantially improves navigation success\nrates by up to 30%, significantly reduces trajectory errors compared to strong\nbaselines, and exhibits impressive zero-shot generalization on the unseen\nTartanDrive dataset. These results highlight UniWM as a principled step toward\nunified, imagination-driven embodied navigation."}

We propose a\ncontinuous memory that encodes each GUI trajectory into a fixed-length sequence\nof continuous embeddings using the VLM itself as an encoder; these embeddings\nare plugged directly into the backbone's input layer, sharply reducing context\ncost while preserving fine-grained visual information. As memory size and\nretrieval depth increase, performance improves monotonically, unlike text\nmemories that degrade with long prompts. To grow memory at low cost, we\nintroduce an auto-scaling data flywheel that (i) discovers new environments via\nsearch, (ii) synthesizes tasks with an open-source VLM, (iii) rolls out\ntrajectories with the agent, and (iv) verifies success with the same VLM.
