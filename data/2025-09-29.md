TL;DR: 提出了一种模型无关的框架，使用直接偏好优化（DPO）来提升放射学报告生成（RRG）的准确性，通过随机对比采样构建训练对，无需奖励模型或人类偏好标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有放射学报告生成方法在真实临床环境中的质量仍不足，而大型视觉语言模型在通用领域通过采用LLM训练策略取得了显著进展。

Method: 使用直接偏好优化（DPO）框架，通过随机对比采样构建训练对，无需额外训练数据或人类标注。

Result: 在三个最先进模型上补充使用随机DPO后，临床性能指标提升了高达5%。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效提升放射学报告生成的准确性，且无需额外训练数据或人类偏好标注。

Abstract: Radiography Report Generation (RRG) has gained significant attention in
medical image analysis as a promising tool for alleviating the growing workload
of radiologists. However, despite numerous advancements, existing methods have
yet to achieve the quality required for deployment in real-world clinical
settings. Meanwhile, large Visual Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable progress in the general domain by adopting training strategies
originally designed for Large Language Models (LLMs), such as alignment
techniques. In this paper, we introduce a model-agnostic framework to enhance
RRG accuracy using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Our approach leverages
random contrastive sampling to construct training pairs, eliminating the need
for reward models or human preference annotations. Experiments on supplementing
three state-of-the-art models with our Random DPO show that our method improves
clinical performance metrics by up to 5%, without requiring any additional
training data.

*William Saakyan,Matthias Norden,Lola Eversmann,Simon Kirsch,Muyu Lin,Simon Guendelman,Isabel Dziobek,Hanna Drimalla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于多模态行为分析的自闭症谱系障碍(ASC)计算机辅助诊断方法，通过分析面部表情、声音韵律、头部运动、心率变异性和凝视行为等特征，改进了凝视特征描述符，在168名ASC参与者和157名非自闭症参与者的数据集上达到了74%的分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于自闭症谱系障碍诊断的复杂性和资源密集性，现有计算机辅助诊断方法存在凝视特征性能差和缺乏现实世界泛化能力的问题，需要开发更有效的诊断支持工具。

Method: 使用标准化的视频数据集进行多模态分析，包括面部表情、声音韵律、头部运动、心率变异性和凝视行为。针对凝视模型局限性，引入了量化眼球凝视角度变异性的新型统计描述符，并采用后期融合方法整合多模态行为标记。

Result: 新型凝视描述符将凝视分类准确率从64%提升到69%，多模态融合后整体分类准确率达到74%，验证了多模态行为标记整合的有效性。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明基于视频的多模态行为分析具有开发可扩展的自闭症筛查工具的潜力，能够支持自闭症评估工作。

Abstract: Due to the complex and resource-intensive nature of diagnosing Autism
Spectrum Condition (ASC), several computer-aided diagnostic support methods
have been proposed to detect autism by analyzing behavioral cues in patient
video data. While these models show promising results on some datasets, they
struggle with poor gaze feature performance and lack of real-world
generalizability. To tackle these challenges, we analyze a standardized video
dataset comprising 168 participants with ASC (46% female) and 157 non-autistic
participants (46% female), making it, to our knowledge, the largest and most
balanced dataset available. We conduct a multimodal analysis of facial
expressions, voice prosody, head motion, heart rate variability (HRV), and gaze
behavior. To address the limitations of prior gaze models, we introduce novel
statistical descriptors that quantify variability in eye gaze angles, improving
gaze-based classification accuracy from 64% to 69% and aligning computational
findings with clinical research on gaze aversion in ASC. Using late fusion, we
achieve a classification accuracy of 74%, demonstrating the effectiveness of
integrating behavioral markers across multiple modalities. Our findings
highlight the potential for scalable, video-based screening tools to support
autism assessment.

### [3] [KV-Efficient VLA: A Method of Speed up Vision Language Model with RNN-Gated Chunked KV Cache](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21354)
*Wanshun Xu,Long Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KV-Efficient VLA是一个模型无关的内存压缩框架，通过选择性保留高价值上下文来减少注意力计算和KV内存开销，实现推理加速和内存减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉-语言-动作(VLA)模型在长序列推理时面临注意力计算二次成本和KV内存无限增长的问题，现有方法在扩展主干架构时往往忽视推理效率对实时部署的重要性。

Method: 将KV缓存划分为固定大小的块，使用循环门控模块根据学习到的效用分数来总结和过滤历史上下文，保留近期细节同时积极修剪过时、低相关性的内存。

Result: 理论上可实现1.21倍推理加速和36% KV内存减少，对任务成功率影响最小，能无缝集成到现有自回归和混合VLA堆栈中。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了可扩展的推理解决方案，无需修改训练流程或下游控制逻辑，解决了VLA模型在长序列推理时的效率瓶颈。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models promise unified robotic perception and
control, yet their scalability is constrained by the quadratic cost of
attention and the unbounded growth of key-value (KV) memory during long-horizon
inference. While recent methods improve generalization through scaling backbone
architectures, they often neglect the inference inefficiencies critical to
real-time deployment. In this work, we present KV-Efficient VLA, a
model-agnostic memory compression framework that addresses these limitations by
introducing a lightweight, training-friendly mechanism to selectively retain
high-utility context. Our method partitions the KV cache into fixed size chunks
and employs a recurrent gating module to summarize and filter historical
context according to learned utility scores. This design preserves recent
fine-grained detail while aggressively pruning stale, low-relevance memory, all
while maintaining causality. Theoretically, KV-Efficient VLA yields up to 1.21x
inference speedup and 36% KV memory reduction, with minimal impact on task
success. Our method integrates seamlessly into existing autoregressive and
hybrid VLA stacks, enabling scalable inference without modifying training
pipelines or downstream control logic.

### [4] [Phrase-grounded Fact-checking for Automatically Generated Chest X-ray Reports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21356)
*Razi Mahmood,Diego Machado-Reyes,Joy Wu,Parisa Kaviani,Ken C. L. Wong,Niharika D'Souza,Mannudeep Kalra,Ge Wang,Pingkun Yan,Tanveer Syeda-Mahmood*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于短语的事实核查模型，用于检测自动生成的胸部X光报告中发现结果及其位置的错误，通过合成数据集和多标签跨模态对比回归网络实现高精度验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模视觉语言模型能够生成逼真的放射学报告，但在推理过程中存在事实错误和幻觉问题，阻碍了其临床应用。

Method: 通过扰动真实报告中的发现结果和位置来创建合成数据集，训练多标签跨模态对比回归网络进行事实核查。

Result: 在多个X光数据集上展示了方法在发现结果真实性预测和定位方面的鲁棒性，与基于真实情况的验证达到0.997的一致性相关系数。

Conclusion: 该方法在放射学工作流程的临床推理中具有实用价值，能够有效检测最先进报告生成器生成的报告中的错误。

Abstract: With the emergence of large-scale vision language models (VLM), it is now
possible to produce realistic-looking radiology reports for chest X-ray images.
However, their clinical translation has been hampered by the factual errors and
hallucinations in the produced descriptions during inference. In this paper, we
present a novel phrase-grounded fact-checking model (FC model) that detects
errors in findings and their indicated locations in automatically generated
chest radiology reports.
  Specifically, we simulate the errors in reports through a large synthetic
dataset derived by perturbing findings and their locations in ground truth
reports to form real and fake findings-location pairs with images. A new
multi-label cross-modal contrastive regression network is then trained on this
dataset. We present results demonstrating the robustness of our method in terms
of accuracy of finding veracity prediction and localization on multiple X-ray
datasets. We also show its effectiveness for error detection in reports of SOTA
report generators on multiple datasets achieving a concordance correlation
coefficient of 0.997 with ground truth-based verification, thus pointing to its
utility during clinical inference in radiology workflows.

### [5] [MDF-MLLM: Deep Fusion Through Cross-Modal Feature Alignment for Contextually Aware Fundoscopic Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21358)
*Jason Jordan,Mohammadreza Akbari Lor,Peter Koulen,Mei-Ling Shyu,Shu-Ching Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的多模态深度学习架构MDF-MLLM，通过整合视网膜眼底图像的细粒度特征和全局文本上下文，显著提升了疾病分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在捕捉视网膜疾病诊断所需的关键低层次空间细节方面存在困难，特别是对于青光眼、糖尿病视网膜病变和视网膜色素变性等疾病。

Method: MDF-MLLM将四个U-Net编码器层的跳跃特征整合到LLaMA 3.2 11B MLLM的交叉注意力块中，通过补丁级投影、缩放交叉注意力和基于FiLM的U-Net调制进行视觉特征融合。

Result: 在双类型疾病分类任务中，MDF-MLLM实现了94%的准确率，比基线模型60%的准确率提升了56%，召回率和F1分数分别提升了67%和35%。

Conclusion: MDF-MLLM为眼底图像分类提供了一个可泛化、可解释和模块化的框架，通过多尺度特征融合超越了传统的MLLM基线，有望在临床决策支持系统中实际部署。

Abstract: This study aimed to enhance disease classification accuracy from retinal
fundus images by integrating fine-grained image features and global textual
context using a novel multimodal deep learning architecture. Existing
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to capture low-level
spatial details critical for diagnosing retinal diseases such as glaucoma,
diabetic retinopathy, and retinitis pigmentosa. This model development and
validation study was conducted on 1,305 fundus image-text pairs compiled from
three public datasets (FIVES, HRF, and StoneRounds), covering acquired and
inherited retinal diseases, and evaluated using classification accuracy and
F1-score. The MDF-MLLM integrates skip features from four U-Net encoder layers
into cross-attention blocks within a LLaMA 3.2 11B MLLM. Vision features are
patch-wise projected and fused using scaled cross-attention and FiLM-based
U-Net modulation. Baseline MLLM achieved 60% accuracy on the dual-type disease
classification task. MDF-MLLM, with both U-Net and MLLM components fully
fine-tuned during training, achieved a significantly higher accuracy of 94%,
representing a 56% improvement. Recall and F1-scores improved by as much as 67%
and 35% over baseline, respectively. Ablation studies confirmed that the
multi-depth fusion approach contributed to substantial gains in spatial
reasoning and classification, particularly for inherited diseases with rich
clinical text. MDF-MLLM presents a generalizable, interpretable, and modular
framework for fundus image classification, outperforming traditional MLLM
baselines through multi-scale feature fusion. The architecture holds promise
for real-world deployment in clinical decision support systems. Future work
will explore synchronized training techniques, a larger pool of diseases for
more generalizability, and extending the model for segmentation tasks.

### [6] [Multimodal Prompt Decoupling Attack on the Safety Filters in Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21360)
*Xingkai Peng,Jun Jiang,Meng Tong,Shuai Li,Weiming Zhang,Nenghai Yu,Kejiang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态提示解耦攻击方法，利用图像模态分离原始不安全提示的有害语义组件，通过伪安全提示和有害提示的组合绕过文本到图像模型的安全过滤器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有越狱方法主要操纵文本提示，图像输入中的潜在漏洞未被充分探索，且文本方法难以绕过模型的安全过滤器。

Method: 使用大语言模型将不安全提示解耦为伪安全提示和有害提示，重写有害提示为自然对抗提示，通过视觉语言模型生成图像标题确保语义一致性。

Result: 该方法能够有效绕过文本到图像模型的安全过滤器，生成NSFW内容。

Conclusion: 多模态提示解耦攻击揭示了文本到图像模型在图像输入方面的安全漏洞，为模型安全防护提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have been widely applied in generating
high-fidelity images across various domains. However, these models may also be
abused to produce Not-Safe-for-Work (NSFW) content via jailbreak attacks.
Existing jailbreak methods primarily manipulate the textual prompt, leaving
potential vulnerabilities in image-based inputs largely unexplored. Moreover,
text-based methods face challenges in bypassing the model's safety filters. In
response to these limitations, we propose the Multimodal Prompt Decoupling
Attack (MPDA), which utilizes image modality to separate the harmful semantic
components of the original unsafe prompt. MPDA follows three core steps:
firstly, a large language model (LLM) decouples unsafe prompts into pseudo-safe
prompts and harmful prompts. The former are seemingly harmless sub-prompts that
can bypass filters, while the latter are sub-prompts with unsafe semantics that
trigger filters. Subsequently, the LLM rewrites the harmful prompts into
natural adversarial prompts to bypass safety filters, which guide the T2I model
to modify the base image into an NSFW output. Finally, to ensure semantic
consistency between the generated NSFW images and the original unsafe prompts,
the visual language model generates image captions, providing a new pathway to
guide the LLM in iterative rewriting and refining the generated content.

### [7] [A Mutual Learning Method for Salient Object Detection with intertwined Multi-Supervision--Revised](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21363)
*Runmin Wu,Mengyang Feng,Wenlong Guan,Dong Wang,Huchuan Lu,Errui Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过联合利用显著目标检测、前景轮廓检测和边缘检测监督来训练显著性检测网络的方法，使用相互学习模块提升性能，在多个数据集上达到state-of-the-art水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前深度学习方法在显著目标检测中存在的预测不完整和边界不准确问题，这些问题源于目标内部复杂性和卷积池化操作中的步长。

Method: 1. 交织使用显著目标检测和前景轮廓检测任务生成均匀高亮的显著性图；2. 前景轮廓和边缘检测任务相互指导，实现精确轮廓预测并减少边缘预测的局部噪声；3. 开发相互学习模块(MLM)，包含多个网络分支进行相互学习。

Result: 在七个具有挑战性的数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在显著目标检测和边缘检测方面都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过多任务监督和相互学习机制，有效解决了显著目标检测中的不完整预测和边界不准确问题，显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Though deep learning techniques have made great progress in salient object
detection recently, the predicted saliency maps still suffer from incomplete
predictions due to the internal complexity of objects and inaccurate boundaries
caused by strides in convolution and pooling operations. To alleviate these
issues, we propose to train saliency detection networks by exploiting the
supervision from not only salient object detection, but also foreground contour
detection and edge detection. First, we leverage salient object detection and
foreground contour detection tasks in an intertwined manner to generate
saliency maps with uniform highlight. Second, the foreground contour and edge
detection tasks guide each other simultaneously, thereby leading to precise
foreground contour prediction and reducing the local noises for edge
prediction. In addition, we develop a novel mutual learning module (MLM) which
serves as the building block of our method. Each MLM consists of multiple
network branches trained in a mutual learning manner, which improves the
performance by a large margin. Extensive experiments on seven challenging
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method has delivered state-of-the-art
results in both salient object detection and edge detection.

### [8] [MAJORScore: A Novel Metric for Evaluating Multimodal Relevance via Joint Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21365)
*Zhicheng Du,Qingyang Shi,Jiasheng Lu,Yingshan Liang,Xinyu Zhang,Yiran Wang,Peiwu Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MAJORScore，一种用于评估多模态（N≥3）相关性的新指标，通过多模态联合表示实现公平的相关性评分


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态相关性评估指标仅适用于两种模态的关联分析，限制了多模态相似性评估的能力

Method: 利用多模态联合表示将多种模态整合到同一潜在空间中，在单一尺度上准确表示不同模态

Result: 相比现有方法，MAJORScore在一致模态上提升了26.03%-64.29%，在不一致模态上降低了13.28%-20.54%

Conclusion: MAJORScore为大规模多模态数据集相似性评估和多模态模型性能评估提供了更可靠的指标

Abstract: The multimodal relevance metric is usually borrowed from the embedding
ability of pretrained contrastive learning models for bimodal data, which is
used to evaluate the correlation between cross-modal data (e.g., CLIP).
However, the commonly used evaluation metrics are only suitable for the
associated analysis between two modalities, which greatly limits the evaluation
of multimodal similarity. Herein, we propose MAJORScore, a brand-new evaluation
metric for the relevance of multiple modalities (N modalities, N>=3) via
multimodal joint representation for the first time. The ability of multimodal
joint representation to integrate multiple modalities into the same latent
space can accurately represent different modalities at one scale, providing
support for fair relevance scoring. Extensive experiments have shown that
MAJORScore increases by 26.03%-64.29% for consistent modality and decreases by
13.28%-20.54% for inconsistence compared to existing methods. MAJORScore serves
as a more reliable metric for evaluating similarity on large-scale multimodal
datasets and multimodal model performance evaluation.

### [9] [Safety Assessment of Scaffolding on Construction Site using AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21368)
*Sameer Prabhu,Amit Patwardhan,Ramin Karim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文开发了一个基于云的AI平台，通过处理和分析脚手架结构的点云数据，自动检测结构修改，以提高脚手架检查的准确性和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前脚手架检查主要依赖人工视觉检查，耗时且易出错，可能导致不安全状况。需要利用人工智能和数字化技术提高检查准确性。

Method: 开发云基AI平台，处理脚手架点云数据，通过比较认证参考数据与最新点云数据来检测结构修改。

Result: 该系统能够自动监测脚手架结构变化，减少人工检查所需的时间和精力。

Conclusion: AI和数字化方法能够显著提高脚手架检查的效率和安全性，为建筑工地安全提供更好的保障。

Abstract: In the construction industry, safety assessment is vital to ensure both the
reliability of assets and the safety of workers. Scaffolding, a key structural
support asset requires regular inspection to detect and identify alterations
from the design rules that may compromise the integrity and stability. At
present, inspections are primarily visual and are conducted by site manager or
accredited personnel to identify deviations. However, visual inspection is
time-intensive and can be susceptible to human errors, which can lead to unsafe
conditions. This paper explores the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
digitization to enhance the accuracy of scaffolding inspection and contribute
to the safety improvement. A cloud-based AI platform is developed to process
and analyse the point cloud data of scaffolding structure. The proposed system
detects structural modifications through comparison and evaluation of certified
reference data with the recent point cloud data. This approach may enable
automated monitoring of scaffolding, reducing the time and effort required for
manual inspections while enhancing the safety on a construction site.

*Aleksa Jelaca,Ying Jiao,Chang Tian,Marie-Francine Moens*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自动提示工程框架，用于生成反事实尺寸的图像（如微型海象与巨型按钮），通过图像评估器、监督提示重写器和DPO训练的排序器来优化提示，在反事实可控性方面超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然文本到图像生成技术快速发展，但细粒度可控性仍然是关键挑战，特别是反事实可控性（生成违背常识模式的图像）对于创造性和探索性应用至关重要。

Method: 构建自动提示工程框架，包含三个组件：图像评估器指导数据集构建，监督提示重写器生成修订提示，DPO训练的排序器选择最优修订提示。还构建了首个反事实尺寸文本-图像数据集，并改进了Grounded SAM图像评估器。

Result: 图像评估器性能比其骨干网络提升了114%，实验表明该方法在反事实可控性方面优于最先进的基准方法和ChatGPT-4o。

Conclusion: 该方法为反事实可控性的未来研究奠定了基础，在生成反事实尺寸图像方面表现出色。

Abstract: Text-to-image generation has advanced rapidly with large-scale multimodal
training, yet fine-grained controllability remains a critical challenge.
Counterfactual controllability, defined as the capacity to deliberately
generate images that contradict common-sense patterns, remains a major
challenge but plays a crucial role in enabling creativity and exploratory
applications. In this work, we address this gap with a focus on counterfactual
size (e.g., generating a tiny walrus beside a giant button) and propose an
automatic prompt engineering framework that adapts base prompts into revised
prompts for counterfactual images. The framework comprises three components: an
image evaluator that guides dataset construction by identifying successful
image generations, a supervised prompt rewriter that produces revised prompts,
and a DPO-trained ranker that selects the optimal revised prompt. We construct
the first counterfactual size text-image dataset and enhance the image
evaluator by extending Grounded SAM with refinements, achieving a 114 percent
improvement over its backbone. Experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and ChatGPT-4o, establishing a
foundation for future research on counterfactual controllability.

*Shiraz S Kaderuppan,Jonathan Mar,Andrew Irvine,Anurag Sharma,Muhammad Ramadan Saifuddin,Wai Leong Eugene Wong,Wai Lok Woo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了两种深度神经网络架构(O-Net和Theta-Net)在非荧光相位调制显微镜下实现超分辨率成像的性能，发现它们在不同信噪比条件下具有互补性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决光学显微镜横向分辨率限制(~200nm)的问题，避免使用昂贵的专用设备或荧光超分辨率技术，为普通显微镜用户提供经济可行的超分辨率解决方案。

Method: 使用两种自研的深度神经网络架构(O-Net和Theta-Net)，在Zernike相衬显微镜和微分干涉相衬显微镜下，对原子力显微镜校准的纳米级特征测试靶进行超分辨率重建。

Result: 两种网络在不同信噪比条件下表现互补：高信噪比图像适合O-Net模型，低信噪比图像更适合Theta-Net模型。

Conclusion: 模型架构和源图像信噪比对超分辨率性能有重要影响，即使使用相同的训练数据和训练周期，不同架构在特定条件下表现各异，需要根据实际应用场景选择合适的模型。

Abstract: The field of optical microscopy spans across numerous industries and research
domains, ranging from education to healthcare, quality inspection and analysis.
Nonetheless, a key limitation often cited by optical microscopists refers to
the limit of its lateral resolution (typically defined as ~200nm), with
potential circumventions involving either costly external modules (e.g.
confocal scan heads, etc) and/or specialized techniques [e.g. super-resolution
(SR) fluorescent microscopy]. Addressing these challenges in a normal
(non-specialist) context thus remains an aspect outside the scope of most
microscope users & facilities. This study thus seeks to evaluate an alternative
& economical approach to achieving SR optical microscopy, involving
non-fluorescent phase-modulated microscopical modalities such as Zernike phase
contrast (PCM) and differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. Two in
silico deep neural network (DNN) architectures which we developed previously
(termed O-Net and Theta-Net) are assessed on their abilities to resolve a
custom-fabricated test target containing nanoscale features calibrated via
atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results of our study demonstrate that
although both O-Net and Theta-Net seemingly performed well when super-resolving
these images, they were complementary (rather than competing) approaches to be
considered for image SR, particularly under different image signal-to-noise
ratios (SNRs). High image SNRs favoured the application of O-Net models, while
low SNRs inclined preferentially towards Theta-Net models. These findings
demonstrate the importance of model architectures (in conjunction with the
source image SNR) on model performance and the SR quality of the generated
images where DNN models are utilized for non-fluorescent optical nanoscopy,
even where the same training dataset & number of epochs are being used.

*Yinfeng Yu,Hailong Zhang,Meiling Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DMTF-AVN方法，通过多目标架构和Transformer机制实现视听融合导航，在Replica和Matterport3D数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在视听融合导航中往往忽视更深层次的感知上下文，需要更有效的多模态线索利用方法。

Method: 使用多目标架构配合改进的Transformer机制，过滤和选择性融合跨模态信息。

Result: 在成功率和路径效率等指标上超越现有方法，表现出强大的可扩展性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 为机器人导航中的先进多模态融合策略开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Audiovisual embodied navigation enables robots to locate audio sources by
dynamically integrating visual observations from onboard sensors with the
auditory signals emitted by the target. The core challenge lies in effectively
leveraging multimodal cues to guide navigation. While prior works have explored
basic fusion of visual and audio data, they often overlook deeper perceptual
context. To address this, we propose the Dynamic Multi-Target Fusion for
Efficient Audio-Visual Navigation (DMTF-AVN). Our approach uses a multi-target
architecture coupled with a refined Transformer mechanism to filter and
selectively fuse cross-modal information. Extensive experiments on the Replica
and Matterport3D datasets demonstrate that DMTF-AVN achieves state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming existing methods in success rate (SR), path
efficiency (SPL), and scene adaptation (SNA). Furthermore, the model exhibits
strong scalability and generalizability, paving the way for advanced multimodal
fusion strategies in robotic navigation. The code and videos are available at

*Enrico Cassano,Riccardo Renzulli,Marco Nurisso,Mirko Zaffaroni,Alan Perotti,Marco Grangetto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAEmnesia是一种监督式稀疏自编码器训练方法，通过系统化概念标签促进一对一的概念-神经元映射，显著提高文本到图像扩散模型中的概念遗忘效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏自编码器虽然能减少神经元的多义性，但个体概念表示仍分布在多个潜在特征中，需要大量搜索过程来实现概念遗忘。

Method: 引入SAEmnesia监督稀疏自编码器训练方法，通过系统化概念标签减轻特征分裂并促进特征集中化，学习具有更强概念关联的专用神经元。

Result: 在推理时，这种可解释表示将超参数搜索减少了96.67%；在UnlearnCanvas基准测试中比现有技术提高了9.22%；在顺序遗忘任务中，9对象移除的遗忘准确率提高了28.4%。

Conclusion: SAEmnesia通过促进一对一的概念-神经元映射，显著提高了概念遗忘的效率和准确性，同时计算开销仅限于训练时的交叉熵计算。

Abstract: Effective concept unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models requires
precise localization of concept representations within the model's latent
space. While sparse autoencoders successfully reduce neuron polysemanticity
(i.e., multiple concepts per neuron) compared to the original network,
individual concept representations can still be distributed across multiple
latent features, requiring extensive search procedures for concept unlearning.
We introduce SAEmnesia, a supervised sparse autoencoder training method that
promotes one-to-one concept-neuron mappings through systematic concept
labeling, mitigating feature splitting and promoting feature centralization.
Our approach learns specialized neurons with significantly stronger concept
associations compared to unsupervised baselines. The only computational
overhead introduced by SAEmnesia is limited to cross-entropy computation during
training. At inference time, this interpretable representation reduces
hyperparameter search by 96.67% with respect to current approaches. On the
UnlearnCanvas benchmark, SAEmnesia achieves a 9.22% improvement over the
state-of-the-art. In sequential unlearning tasks, we demonstrate superior
scalability with a 28.4% improvement in unlearning accuracy for 9-object
removal.

Abstract: Deep Learning models have transformed various domains, including the
healthcare sector, particularly biomedical image classification by learning
intricate features and enabling accurate diagnostics pertaining to complex
diseases. Recent studies have adopted two different approaches to train DL
models: training from scratch and transfer learning. Both approaches demand
substantial computational time and resources due to the involvement of massive
datasets in model training. These computational demands are further increased
due to the design-space exploration required for selecting optimal
hyperparameters, which typically necessitates several training rounds. With the
growing sizes of datasets, exploring solutions to this problem has recently
gained the research community's attention. A plausible solution is to select a
subset of the dataset for training and hyperparameter search. This subset,
referred to as the corset, must be a representative set of the original
dataset. A straightforward approach to selecting the coreset could be employing
random sampling, albeit at the cost of compromising the representativeness of
the original dataset. A critical limitation of random sampling is the bias
towards the dominant classes in an imbalanced dataset. Even if the dataset has
inter-class balance, this random sampling will not capture intra-class
diversity. This study addresses this issue by introducing an intelligent,
lightweight mechanism for coreset selection. Specifically, it proposes a method
to extract intra-class diversity, forming per-class clusters that are utilized
for the final sampling. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology
by conducting extensive classification experiments on a well-known biomedical
imaging dataset. Results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the
random sampling approach on several performance metrics for uniform conditions.

*Manel Rakez,Thomas Louis,Julien Guillaumin,Foucauld Chamming's,Pierre Fillard,Brice Amadeo,Virginie Rondeau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LongiMam是一个端到端的深度学习模型，整合当前和最多四个既往乳腺X光片，通过卷积神经网络和循环神经网络捕捉空间和时间模式，提高乳腺癌预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数深度学习模型仅使用单次或有限次数的既往乳腺X光片，且缺乏对现实世界不平衡结果分布和异质性随访的适应性。需要开发能够充分利用纵向成像数据的稳健模型。

Method: 开发LongiMam模型，结合卷积神经网络和循环神经网络，整合当前和最多四个既往乳腺X光片，在大规模人群筛查数据集上进行训练和评估。

Result: LongiMam在包含既往乳腺X光片时持续改善预测性能，当前和既往检查组合优于单次检查模型。在乳腺密度随时间变化的女性中表现最佳，且在关键风险群体中均有效。

Conclusion: 纵向建模增强乳腺癌预测能力，支持在筛查项目中使用重复乳腺X光片来优化风险分层。LongiMam作为开源软件公开可用。

Abstract: Risk-adapted breast cancer screening requires robust models that leverage
longitudinal imaging data. Most current deep learning models use single or
limited prior mammograms and lack adaptation for real-world settings marked by
imbalanced outcome distribution and heterogeneous follow-up. We developed
LongiMam, an end-to-end deep learning model that integrates both current and up
to four prior mammograms. LongiMam combines a convolutional and a recurrent
neural network to capture spatial and temporal patterns predictive of breast
cancer. The model was trained and evaluated using a large, population-based
screening dataset with disproportionate case-to-control ratio typical of
clinical screening. Across several scenarios that varied in the number and
composition of prior exams, LongiMam consistently improved prediction when
prior mammograms were included. The addition of prior and current visits
outperformed single-visit models, while priors alone performed less well,
highlighting the importance of combining historical and recent information.
Subgroup analyses confirmed the model's efficacy across key risk groups,
including women with dense breasts and those aged 55 years or older. Moreover,
the model performed best in women with observed changes in mammographic density
over time. These findings demonstrate that longitudinal modeling enhances
breast cancer prediction and support the use of repeated mammograms to refine
risk stratification in screening programs. LongiMam is publicly available as
open-source software.

*Laurent Mertens,Elahe' Yargholi,Laura Van Hove,Hans Op de Beeck,Jan Van den Stock,Joost Vennekens*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文探索了卷积神经网络（CNNs）与人类大脑在社交认知任务中的对应关系，发现CNNs难以超越简单的视觉处理，不能反映更高阶的脑处理过程，并提出了Object2Brain框架来分析不同对象类别对CNN-人类相关性的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究卷积神经网络与人类大脑在更复杂的脑过程（如社交认知）中的对应关系，而不仅仅局限于一般视觉感知。

Method: 通过相关性分析评估流行CNN架构与人类行为及fMRI数据在图像情感评估任务中的对齐程度，并提出了结合GradCAM和对象检测的Object2Brain框架。

Result: CNNs在此任务中难以超越简单视觉处理，不能反映高阶脑处理；不同CNN架构显示出不同的对象类别敏感性。

Conclusion: 对于社交认知等复杂脑过程，CNNs与人类大脑的对应关系有限，需要更深入的研究来理解神经网络与人类认知的关联。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a popular type of computer model
that have proven their worth in many computer vision tasks. Moreover, they form
an interesting study object for the field of psychology, with shown
correspondences between the workings of CNNs and the human brain. However,
these correspondences have so far mostly been studied in the context of general
visual perception. In contrast, this paper explores to what extent this
correspondence also holds for a more complex brain process, namely social
cognition. To this end, we assess the alignment between popular CNN
architectures and both human behavioral and fMRI data for image valence
appraisal through a correlation analysis. We show that for this task CNNs
struggle to go beyond simple visual processing, and do not seem to reflect
higher-order brain processing. Furthermore, we present Object2Brain, a novel
framework that combines GradCAM and object detection at the CNN-filter level
with the aforementioned correlation analysis to study the influence of
different object classes on the CNN-to-human correlations. Despite similar
correlation trends, different CNN architectures are shown to display different
object class sensitivities.

### [17] [Debugging Concept Bottleneck Models through Removal and Retraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21385)
*Eric Enouen,Sainyam Galhotra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个可解释的调试框架，用于概念瓶颈模型（CBMs），通过移除和重新训练两个步骤来纠正模型中的系统性偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CBM的概念干预无法解决模型与专家推理之间的系统性偏差问题，特别是当模型从有偏数据中学习捷径时。

Method: 采用两步调试框架：1）移除步骤-专家识别并移除不良概念；2）重新训练步骤-使用CBDebug方法将概念级用户反馈转换为样本级辅助标签，应用监督偏差缓解和定向增强。

Result: CBDebug在多个CBM架构（PIP-Net、后处理CBM）和已知虚假相关基准测试中显著优于先前的重新训练方法。

Conclusion: 该框架有效减少了模型对不良概念的依赖，提升了CBM的可靠性和与专家推理的一致性。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) use a set of human-interpretable concepts to
predict the final task label, enabling domain experts to not only validate the
CBM's predictions, but also intervene on incorrect concepts at test time.
However, these interventions fail to address systemic misalignment between the
CBM and the expert's reasoning, such as when the model learns shortcuts from
biased data. To address this, we present a general interpretable debugging
framework for CBMs that follows a two-step process of Removal and Retraining.
In the Removal step, experts use concept explanations to identify and remove
any undesired concepts. In the Retraining step, we introduce CBDebug, a novel
method that leverages the interpretability of CBMs as a bridge for converting
concept-level user feedback into sample-level auxiliary labels. These labels
are then used to apply supervised bias mitigation and targeted augmentation,
reducing the model's reliance on undesired concepts. We evaluate our framework
with both real and automated expert feedback, and find that CBDebug
significantly outperforms prior retraining methods across multiple CBM
architectures (PIP-Net, Post-hoc CBM) and benchmarks with known spurious
correlations.

TL;DR: ShipwreckFinder是一个开源的QGIS插件，使用深度学习从多波束声纳数据中自动检测沉船，相比现有方法具有更好的分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 沉船是海上历史的重要标志，但通过手动检查测深数据发现沉船耗时且需要专家分析，需要自动化工具来提高效率。

Method: 开发了一个开源QGIS插件，包含数据预处理、深度学习推理、模型输出阈值处理，可生成像素级分割掩码或边界框。使用来自大湖区和爱尔兰海岸的沉船数据进行训练，并采用合成数据生成增加数据集规模和多样性。

Result: 与基于深度学习的ArcGIS工具包和经典的反向沉洞检测方法相比，该工具在分割性能上表现更优。

Conclusion: ShipwreckFinder提供了一个有效的开源解决方案，能够自动检测沉船，显著提高了沉船发现的效率。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce ShipwreckFinder, an open-source QGIS plugin that
detects shipwrecks from multibeam sonar data. Shipwrecks are an important
historical marker of maritime history, and can be discovered through manual
inspection of bathymetric data. However, this is a time-consuming process and
often requires expert analysis. Our proposed tool allows users to automatically
preprocess bathymetry data, perform deep learning inference, threshold model
outputs, and produce either pixel-wise segmentation masks or bounding boxes of
predicted shipwrecks. The backbone of this open-source tool is a deep learning
model, which is trained on a variety of shipwreck data from the Great Lakes and
the coasts of Ireland. Additionally, we employ synthetic data generation in
order to increase the size and diversity of our dataset. We demonstrate
superior segmentation performance with our open-source tool and training
pipeline as compared to a deep learning-based ArcGIS toolkit and a more
classical inverse sinkhole detection method. The open-source tool can be found

TL;DR: 研究显示轻到中度剪枝能改善显著性图的聚焦度和忠实度，同时保持语义概念，而过度剪枝会降低可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨剪枝对神经网络可解释性的影响，特别是对显著性图和概念表示的影响。

Method: 使用ResNet-18在ImageNette上训练，比较不同剪枝水平下Vanilla Gradients和Integrated Gradients的解释效果，并应用CRAFT方法提取概念。

Result: 轻中度剪枝改善显著性图质量和概念语义一致性，而重度剪枝会合并异质特征，降低可解释性。

Conclusion: 剪枝可以塑造内部表示使其更符合人类注意力模式，但过度剪枝会损害可解释性。

Abstract: Prior works have shown that neural networks can be heavily pruned while
preserving performance, but the impact of pruning on model interpretability
remains unclear. In this work, we investigate how magnitude-based pruning
followed by fine-tuning affects both low-level saliency maps and high-level
concept representations. Using a ResNet-18 trained on ImageNette, we compare
post-hoc explanations from Vanilla Gradients (VG) and Integrated Gradients (IG)
across pruning levels, evaluating sparsity and faithfulness. We further apply
CRAFT-based concept extraction to track changes in semantic coherence of
learned concepts. Our results show that light-to-moderate pruning improves
saliency-map focus and faithfulness while retaining distinct, semantically
meaningful concepts. In contrast, aggressive pruning merges heterogeneous
features, reducing saliency map sparsity and concept coherence despite
maintaining accuracy. These findings suggest that while pruning can shape
internal representations toward more human-aligned attention patterns,
excessive pruning undermines interpretability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TUN3D是首个基于多视图图像输入，无需真实相机位姿或深度监督，联合处理布局估计和3D物体检测的方法，在多个室内场景理解基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖点云输入，但大多数消费级相机缺乏深度传感器，视觉数据更为普遍。需要解决仅使用多视图图像进行室内场景理解的问题。

Method: 基于轻量级稀疏卷积骨干网络，使用两个专用头：一个用于3D物体检测，一个用于布局估计，采用新颖有效的参数化墙壁表示。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的场景理解基准测试中达到最先进性能：(i)使用真实点云，(ii)使用带位姿图像，(iii)使用无位姿图像。在3D物体检测方面与专用方法相当，在布局估计方面显著提升。

Conclusion: TUN3D为整体室内场景理解设定了新基准，证明了仅使用多视图图像进行联合布局估计和3D物体检测的可行性。

Abstract: Layout estimation and 3D object detection are two fundamental tasks in indoor
scene understanding. When combined, they enable the creation of a compact yet
semantically rich spatial representation of a scene. Existing approaches
typically rely on point cloud input, which poses a major limitation since most
consumer cameras lack depth sensors and visual-only data remains far more
common. We address this issue with TUN3D, the first method that tackles joint
layout estimation and 3D object detection in real scans, given multi-view
images as input, and does not require ground-truth camera poses or depth
supervision. Our approach builds on a lightweight sparse-convolutional backbone
and employs two dedicated heads: one for 3D object detection and one for layout
estimation, leveraging a novel and effective parametric wall representation.
Extensive experiments show that TUN3D achieves state-of-the-art performance
across three challenging scene understanding benchmarks: (i) using ground-truth
point clouds, (ii) using posed images, and (iii) using unposed images. While
performing on par with specialized 3D object detection methods, TUN3D
significantly advances layout estimation, setting a new benchmark in holistic
indoor scene understanding. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种创新的生成式语义通信系统，通过将图像分割为关键和非关键区域来优化语义粒度，关键区域使用图像导向语义编码器处理，非关键区域通过图像到文本建模方法压缩，并采用轻量级部署策略提升资源利用率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法往往忽视图像不同区域的重要性差异，可能损害视觉关键内容的重建质量，需要解决语义通信系统中图像传输的效率和质量问题。

Method: 将图像分割为关键和非关键区域，关键区域使用图像导向语义编码器处理，非关键区域通过图像到文本建模方法压缩，并采用模型量化和低秩适应微调等轻量级部署技术。

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提出的系统在语义保真度和视觉质量方面均优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 该系统在图像传输任务中表现出有效性，能够在不牺牲性能的情况下显著提升资源利用率。

Abstract: The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has
introduced significant opportunities for enhancing the efficiency and accuracy
of image transmission within semantic communication systems. Despite these
advancements, existing methodologies often neglect the difference in importance
of different regions of the image, potentially compromising the reconstruction
quality of visually critical content. To address this issue, we introduce an
innovative generative semantic communication system that refines semantic
granularity by segmenting images into key and non-key regions. Key regions,
which contain essential visual information, are processed using an image
oriented semantic encoder, while non-key regions are efficiently compressed
through an image-to-text modeling approach. Additionally, to mitigate the
substantial storage and computational demands posed by large AI models, the
proposed system employs a lightweight deployment strategy incorporating model
quantization and low-rank adaptation fine-tuning techniques, significantly
boosting resource utilization without sacrificing performance. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms traditional methods in
terms of both semantic fidelity and visual quality, thereby affirming its
effectiveness for image transmission tasks.

Result: 实验证明该框架在鲁棒骨架化、形状压缩和增材制造刚度增强等任务中有效。

Conclusion: 骨架化尺度空间提供了一种理论严谨、满足尺度空间特性的形状层次简化方法，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The Hamilton-Jacobi skeleton, also known as the medial axis, is a powerful
shape descriptor that represents binary objects in terms of the centres of
maximal inscribed discs. Despite its broad applicability, the medial axis
suffers from sensitivity to noise: minor boundary variations can lead to
disproportionately large and undesirable expansions of the skeleton. Classical
pruning methods mitigate this shortcoming by systematically removing extraneous
skeletal branches. This sequential simplification of skeletons resembles the
principle of sparsification scale-spaces that embed images into a family of
reconstructions from increasingly sparse pixel representations.
  We combine both worlds by introducing skeletonisation scale-spaces: They
leverage sparsification of the medial axis to achieve hierarchical
simplification of shapes. Unlike conventional pruning, our framework inherently
satisfies key scale-space properties such as hierarchical architecture,
controllable simplification, and equivariance to geometric transformations. We
provide a rigorous theoretical foundation in both continuous and discrete
formulations and extend the concept further with densification. This allows
inverse progression from coarse to fine scales and can even reach beyond the
original skeleton to produce overcomplete shape representations with relevancy
for practical applications.
  Through proof-of-concept experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework for practical tasks including robust skeletonisation, shape
compression, and stiffness enhancement for additive manufacturing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有气候预测空间分辨率低（12.5公里），限制了其在地方决策中的可用性，需要开发高分辨率气候预测方法。

Method: 在观测网格数据集上训练单图像超分辨率模型，然后应用于低分辨率气候预测；提出基于气候指标的评估方法，使用气象站观测数据计算气候指数来评估降尺度结果。

Result: 日平均温度实验表明，单图像超分辨率模型能够降尺度气候预测，且不会增加气候指标误差。

Conclusion: 单图像超分辨率模型是有效的气候预测降尺度方法，能够生成高分辨率气候预测而不降低准确性。

Abstract: High-resolution climate projections are essential for local decision-making.
However, available climate projections have low spatial resolution (e.g. 12.5
km), which limits their usability. We address this limitation by leveraging
single-image super-resolution models to statistically downscale climate
projections to 1-km resolution. Since high-resolution climate projections are
unavailable for training, we train models on a high-resolution observational
gridded data set and apply them to low-resolution climate projections. We
propose a climate indicator-based assessment using observed climate indices
computed at weather station locations to evaluate the downscaled climate
projections without ground-truth high-resolution climate projections.
Experiments on daily mean temperature demonstrate that single-image
super-resolution models can downscale climate projections without increasing
the error of climate indicators compared to low-resolution climate projections.

Conclusion: 基于图像的越狱攻击存在实际挑战，需要为视觉语言模型开发有效的防御机制

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have remarkable abilities in generating
multimodal reasoning tasks. However, potential misuse or safety alignment
concerns of VLMs have increased significantly due to different categories of
attack vectors. Among various attack vectors, recent studies have demonstrated
that image-based perturbations are particularly effective in generating harmful
outputs. In the literature, many existing techniques have been proposed to
jailbreak VLMs, leading to unstable performance and visible perturbations. In
this study, we propose Jailbreaking with Loss-guided Image Perturbation
(JaiLIP), a jailbreaking attack in the image space that minimizes a joint
objective combining the mean squared error (MSE) loss between clean and
adversarial image with the models harmful-output loss. We evaluate our proposed
method on VLMs using standard toxicity metrics from Perspective API and
Detoxify. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates highly
effective and imperceptible adversarial images, outperforming existing methods
in producing toxicity. Moreover, we have evaluated our method in the
transportation domain to demonstrate the attacks practicality beyond toxic text
generation in specific domain. Our findings emphasize the practical challenges
of image-based jailbreak attacks and the need for efficient defense mechanisms
for VLMs.

Conclusion: 深度学习在植物和动物自动识别方面取得了显著进展，其性能已接近人类专家，这对计算机科学家和自然学家都具有重要意义。

Abstract: Automated identification of plants and animals has improved considerably in
the last few years, in particular thanks to the recent advances in deep
learning. The next big question is how far such automated systems are from the
human expertise. Indeed, even the best experts are sometimes confused and/or
disagree between each others when validating visual or audio observations of
living organism. A picture actually contains only a partial information that is
usually not sufficient to determine the right species with certainty.
Quantifying this uncertainty and comparing it to the performance of automated
systems is of high interest for both computer scientists and expert
naturalists. The LifeCLEF 2018 ExpertCLEF challenge presented in this paper was
designed to allow this comparison between human experts and automated systems.
In total, 19 deep-learning systems implemented by 4 different research teams
were evaluated with regard to 9 expert botanists of the French flora. The main
outcome of this work is that the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning
models is now close to the most advanced human expertise. This paper presents
more precisely the resources and assessments of the challenge, summarizes the
approaches and systems employed by the participating research groups, and
provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

Conclusion: 这项工作为原生四边形网格生成设立了新基准，展示了将大规模自回归模型与拓扑感知的RL优化相结合在创建结构化3D资源方面的强大能力。

Abstract: The generation of quadrilateral-dominant meshes is a cornerstone of
professional 3D content creation. However, existing generative models generate
quad meshes by first generating triangle meshes and then merging triangles into
quadrilaterals with some specific rules, which typically produces quad meshes
with poor topology. In this paper, we introduce QuadGPT, the first
autoregressive framework for generating quadrilateral meshes in an end-to-end
manner. QuadGPT formulates this as a sequence prediction paradigm,
distinguished by two key innovations: a unified tokenization method to handle
mixed topologies of triangles and quadrilaterals, and a specialized
Reinforcement Learning fine-tuning method tDPO for better generation quality.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that QuadGPT significantly surpasses previous
triangle-to-quad conversion pipelines in both geometric accuracy and
topological quality. Our work establishes a new benchmark for native quad-mesh
generation and showcases the power of combining large-scale autoregressive
models with topology-aware RL refinement for creating structured 3D assets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DyME是一个按需概念擦除框架，通过训练轻量级的概念特定LoRA适配器，在推理时动态组合所需适配器，实现灵活的多概念擦除。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的概念擦除方法无法扩展到实际场景中需要擦除多个可能冲突概念的情况，因为它们依赖静态擦除，无法根据推理时的实际需求灵活调整。

Method: 提出DyME框架，训练概念特定的LoRA适配器，引入双层正交性约束（特征级和参数级）来减少适配器间的干扰，并开发了分层基准ErasureBench-H。

Result: 在ErasureBench-H和标准数据集上的实验表明，DyME在保持多概念擦除保真度的同时，最小化了附带退化，优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: DyME通过动态组合和正交性约束，有效解决了多概念擦除中的干扰问题，为实际应用提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) inadvertently reproduce copyrighted
styles and protected visual concepts, raising legal and ethical concerns.
Concept erasure has emerged as a safeguard, aiming to selectively suppress such
concepts through fine-tuning. However, existing methods do not scale to
practical settings where providers must erase multiple and possibly conflicting
concepts. The core bottleneck is their reliance on static erasure: a single
checkpoint is fine-tuned to remove all target concepts, regardless of the
actual erasure needs at inference. This rigid design mismatches real-world
usage, where requests vary per generation, leading to degraded erasure success
and reduced fidelity for non-target content. We propose DyME, an on-demand
erasure framework that trains lightweight, concept-specific LoRA adapters and
dynamically composes only those needed at inference. This modular design
enables flexible multi-concept erasure, but naive composition causes
interference among adapters, especially when many or semantically related
concepts are suppressed. To overcome this, we introduce bi-level orthogonality
constraints at both the feature and parameter levels, disentangling
representation shifts and enforcing orthogonal adapter subspaces. We further
develop ErasureBench-H, a new hierarchical benchmark with
brand-series-character structure, enabling principled evaluation across
semantic granularities and erasure set sizes. Experiments on ErasureBench-H and
standard datasets (e.g., CIFAR-100, Imagenette) demonstrate that DyME
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher
multi-concept erasure fidelity with minimal collateral degradation.

*Abdul Waheed,Zhen Wu,Dareen Alharthi,Seungone Kim,Bhiksha Raj*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoJudge是一个专门用于评估视频理解模型输出的3B和7B多模态大语言模型，在多个基准测试中优于更大的基线模型，证明了视频输入对视频理解任务评估的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频理解模型的评估存在挑战：常用指标如BLEU、ROUGE等无法捕捉人类判断的精细度，而人工评估成本高昂。现有LLM/MLLM评估器在视频理解领域的应用相对较少。

Method: 通过生成器和评估器的交互训练：生成器根据目标评分生成响应，不匹配评估器评分的响应被丢弃。构建了3B和7B规模的VideoJudge模型。

Result: 在四个元评估基准中的三个，VideoJudge-7B表现优于更大的MLLM基线模型（如Qwen2.5-VL 32B和72B）。发现纯LLM评估器表现不如MLLM评估器，长链推理无法提升性能。

Conclusion: 视频输入对视频理解任务的评估至关重要，VideoJudge证明了专门化MLLM评估器在视频理解评估中的有效性。

Abstract: Precisely evaluating video understanding models remains challenging: commonly
used metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore fail to capture the fineness of
human judgment, while obtaining such judgments through manual evaluation is
costly. Recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) or
multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as evaluators, but their extension to video
understanding remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we introduce
VideoJudge, a 3B and 7B-sized MLLM judge specialized to evaluate outputs from
video understanding models (\textit{i.e.}, text responses conditioned on
videos). To train VideoJudge, our recipe builds on the interplay between a
generator and an evaluator: the generator is prompted to produce responses
conditioned on a target rating, and responses not matching the evaluator's
rating are discarded. Across three out of four meta-evaluation benchmarks,
VideoJudge-7B outperforms larger MLLM judge baselines such as Qwen2.5-VL (32B
and 72B). Notably, we find that LLM judges (Qwen3) models perform worse than
MLLM judges (Qwen2.5-VL) and long chain-of-thought reasoning does not improve
performance, indicating that providing video inputs is crucial for evaluation
of video understanding tasks.

*Dereje Shenkut,B. V. K Vijaya Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReVQom是一种用于多智能体协同感知的端到端特征压缩方法，通过瓶颈网络和多阶段残差向量量化将特征从8192 bpp压缩到6-30 bpp，在DAIR-V2X数据集上实现273-1365倍压缩，保持空间身份的同时最小化精度损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体协同感知通过共享信息提升场景理解能力，但通信带宽限制了系统的可扩展性，需要高效的压缩方法来减少传输负载。

Method: 采用端到端方法，首先通过简单的瓶颈网络压缩特征维度，然后使用多阶段残差向量量化(RVQ)，仅传输每像素的码本索引。

Result: 在DAIR-V2X真实世界数据集上，ReVQom实现273倍压缩(30 bpp)到1365倍压缩(6 bpp)，在18 bpp时性能匹配或优于原始特征协同感知，在6-12 bpp时实现超低带宽操作。

Conclusion: ReVQom能够实现高效准确的多智能体协同感知，为实际V2X部署迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Multi-agent collaborative perception (CP) improves scene understanding by
sharing information across connected agents such as autonomous vehicles,
unmanned aerial vehicles, and robots. Communication bandwidth, however,
constrains scalability. We present ReVQom, a learned feature codec that
preserves spatial identity while compressing intermediate features. ReVQom is
an end-to-end method that compresses feature dimensions via a simple bottleneck
network followed by multi-stage residual vector quantization (RVQ). This allows
only per-pixel code indices to be transmitted, reducing payloads from 8192 bits
per pixel (bpp) of uncompressed 32-bit float features to 6-30 bpp per agent
with minimal accuracy loss. On DAIR-V2X real-world CP dataset, ReVQom achieves
273x compression at 30 bpp to 1365x compression at 6 bpp. At 18 bpp (455x),
ReVQom matches or outperforms raw-feature CP, and at 6-12 bpp it enables
ultra-low-bandwidth operation with graceful degradation. ReVQom allows
efficient and accurate multi-agent collaborative perception with a step toward
practical V2X deployment.

*Khaloud S. AlKhalifah,Malak Mashaabi,Hend Al-Khalifa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了三种文本到图像AI模型在生成沙特阿拉伯职业图像时存在的性别刻板印象和文化不准确性问题，发现模型输出存在严重的性别失衡和文化误读。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调查当代文本到图像AI模型在生成沙特职业图像时是否延续性别刻板印象和文化不准确性，评估这些模型对社会偏见的反映程度。

Method: 使用中性提示词为56种沙特职业生成1,006张图像，由两名沙特标注员从五个维度评估每张图像，包括感知性别、服装外观、背景设置、活动互动和年龄，第三位资深研究员裁决分歧。

Result: 结果显示强烈性别失衡：ImageFX输出85%为男性，Grok 86.6%为男性，DALL-E V3 96%为男性，其中DALL-E V3性别刻板印象最严重。领导力和技术角色中的性别失衡尤为明显，所有模型都经常出现服装、场景和活动方面的文化不准确性。

Conclusion: 当前模型反映了训练数据中嵌入的社会偏见，仅有限地反映了沙特劳动力市场的性别动态和文化细微差别，迫切需要更多样化的训练数据、更公平的算法和文化敏感的评估框架。

Abstract: This study investigates the extent to which contemporary Text-to-Image
artificial intelligence (AI) models perpetuate gender stereotypes and cultural
inaccuracies when generating depictions of professionals in Saudi Arabia. We
analyzed 1,006 images produced by ImageFX, DALL-E V3, and Grok for 56 diverse
Saudi professions using neutral prompts. Two trained Saudi annotators evaluated
each image on five dimensions: perceived gender, clothing and appearance,
background and setting, activities and interactions, and age. A third senior
researcher adjudicated whenever the two primary raters disagreed, yielding
10,100 individual judgements. The results reveal a strong gender imbalance,
with ImageFX outputs being 85\% male, Grok 86.6\% male, and DALL-E V3 96\%
male, indicating that DALL-E V3 exhibited the strongest overall gender
stereotyping. This imbalance was most evident in leadership and technical
roles. Moreover, cultural inaccuracies in clothing, settings, and depicted
activities were frequently observed across all three models.
Counter-stereotypical images often arise from cultural misinterpretations
rather than genuinely progressive portrayals. We conclude that current models
mirror societal biases embedded in their training data, generated by humans,
offering only a limited reflection of the Saudi labour market's gender dynamics
and cultural nuances. These findings underscore the urgent need for more
diverse training data, fairer algorithms, and culturally sensitive evaluation
frameworks to ensure equitable and authentic visual outputs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于推理增强的多模态大语言模型预训练范式，用于统一的不当内容检测，通过三个针对性预训练任务解决短视频内容与原始预训练数据之间的分布差距问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常为每种问题类型训练单独的小型分类模型，需要大量人工标注数据且缺乏跨问题泛化能力。

Method: 引入三个针对性预训练任务：Caption（增强视频细节感知）、VQA（加深问题定义理解）、Chain-of-Thought（增强推理能力）。

Result: 实验结果显示该预训练方法显著提升了MLLM在零样本和监督微调设置下的性能，且对未见问题表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了短视频不当内容检测中的分布差距和复杂问题定义挑战，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Short video platforms are evolving rapidly, making the identification of
inappropriate content increasingly critical. Existing approaches typically
train separate and small classification models for each type of issue, which
requires extensive human-labeled data and lacks cross-issue generalization. We
propose a reasoning-enhanced multimodal large language model (MLLM) pretraining
paradigm for unified inappropriate content detection. To address the
distribution gap between short video content and the original pretraining data
of MLLMs, as well as the complex issue definitions, we introduce three targeted
pretraining tasks: (1) \textit{Caption}, to enhance the MLLM's perception of
video details; (2) \textit{Visual Question Answering (VQA)}, to deepen the
MLLM's understanding of issue definitions and annotation guidelines; (3)
\textit{Chain-of-Thought (CoT)}, to enhance the MLLM's reasoning capability.
Experimental results show that our pretraining approach significantly improves
the MLLM's performance in both zero-shot and supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
settings. In addition, our pretrained model demonstrates strong generalization
capabilities to emergent, previously unseen issues.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 将GUI定位重新定义为交互式搜索任务，通过光标移动来定位UI元素，而不是直接预测坐标，解决了VLMs在高分辨率GUI图像中预测坐标不准确的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将GUI定位视为坐标预测任务，但VLMs在处理高分辨率、复杂布局的GUI图像时难以准确预测数值坐标，需要新的方法来解决这个问题。

Method: 提出GUI-Cursor模型，将GUI定位重构为交互式搜索任务：模型生成动作移动光标来定位UI元素，每一步确定目标对象、评估光标与目标的空间关系，并根据移动历史将光标移近目标。使用多步在线强化学习训练，采用基于轨迹的密集奖励函数。

Result: 基于Qwen2.5-VL-7B的GUI-Cursor显著提升了GUI定位准确率，在ScreenSpot-v2上从88.8%提升到93.9%，在ScreenSpot-Pro上从26.8%提升到56.5%。95%的实例在两步内解决问题，对困难示例能自适应增加步骤。

Conclusion: 将GUI定位重构为交互式搜索任务比直接坐标预测更有效，GUI-Cursor方法在准确率和效率方面都取得了显著提升，展示了交互式方法在GUI理解任务中的优势。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding is commonly framed as a coordinate
prediction task -- given a natural language instruction, generate on-screen
coordinates for actions such as clicks and keystrokes. However, recent Vision
Language Models (VLMs) often fail to predict accurate numeric coordinates when
processing high-resolution GUI images with complex layouts. To address this
issue, we reframe GUI grounding as an \emph{interactive search task}, where the
VLM generates actions to move a cursor in the GUI to locate UI elements. At
each step, the model determines the target object, evaluates the spatial
relations between the cursor and the target, and moves the cursor closer to the
target conditioned on the movement history. In this interactive process, the
rendered cursor provides visual feedback to help the model align its
predictions with the corresponding on-screen locations. We train our GUI
grounding model, GUI-Cursor, using multi-step online reinforcement learning
with a dense trajectory-based reward function. Our experimental results show
that GUI-Cursor, based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, improves the GUI grounding accuracy
and achieves state-of-the-art results on ScreenSpot-v2 ($88.8\% \rightarrow
93.9\%$) and ScreenSpot-Pro ($26.8\% \rightarrow 56.5\%$). Moreover, we observe
that GUI-Cursor learns to solve the problem within two steps for 95\% of
instances and can adaptively conduct more steps on more difficult examples.

TL;DR: X-CoT是一个基于LLM思维链推理的可解释视频检索框架，替代传统的嵌入模型相似度排序方法，通过成对比较步骤生成详细推理和完整排序，提高检索性能和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本-视频检索系统存在两个局限：低质量文本-视频数据对会损害检索效果但难以识别；余弦相似度无法解释排序结果，限制了可解释性。

Method: 提出X-CoT框架，在现有基准上增加视频标注以支持语义理解和减少数据偏差，设计包含成对比较步骤的检索思维链，生成详细推理和完整排序。

Result: X-CoT在实证中提升了检索性能并产生详细推理依据，同时促进了模型行为和数据质量分析。

Conclusion: X-CoT通过可解释的检索框架解决了传统方法的局限性，为模型评估和数据质量检查提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Prevalent text-to-video retrieval systems mainly adopt embedding models for
feature extraction and compute cosine similarities for ranking. However, this
design presents two limitations. Low-quality text-video data pairs could
compromise the retrieval, yet are hard to identify and examine. Cosine
similarity alone provides no explanation for the ranking results, limiting the
interpretability. We ask that can we interpret the ranking results, so as to
assess the retrieval models and examine the text-video data? This work proposes
X-CoT, an explainable retrieval framework upon LLM CoT reasoning in place of
the embedding model-based similarity ranking. We first expand the existing
benchmarks with additional video annotations to support semantic understanding
and reduce data bias. We also devise a retrieval CoT consisting of pairwise
comparison steps, yielding detailed reasoning and complete ranking. X-CoT
empirically improves the retrieval performance and produces detailed
rationales. It also facilitates the model behavior and data quality analysis.

Motivation: 手术器械的安全检测需要可靠的视觉缺陷检测，但人工检查容易出错，而现有的基于自然/工业图像训练的自动检测方法在手术领域迁移效果不佳，存在误报、对小缺陷不敏感等问题。

Method: 集成背景掩码、基于补丁的分析策略和高效的领域自适应，专门针对手术器械图像优化无监督缺陷检测方法。

Result: 该方法能够可靠地检测手术器械图像中的细粒度缺陷，克服了现有方法的局限性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过专门针对手术器械的优化，实现了在手术器械图像上可靠的缺陷检测，解决了领域迁移带来的问题。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of surgical instruments requires reliable detection of
visual defects. However, manual inspection is prone to error, and existing
automated defect detection methods, typically trained on natural/industrial
images, fail to transfer effectively to the surgical domain. We demonstrate
that simply applying or fine-tuning these approaches leads to issues: false
positive detections arising from textured backgrounds, poor sensitivity to
small, subtle defects, and inadequate capture of instrument-specific features
due to domain shift. To address these challenges, we propose a versatile method
that adapts unsupervised defect detection methods specifically for surgical
instruments. By integrating background masking, a patch-based analysis
strategy, and efficient domain adaptation, our method overcomes these
limitations, enabling the reliable detection of fine-grained defects in
surgical instrument imagery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于表示对齐的方法依赖大型预训练编码器，计算成本高昂。需要一种无需外部编码器的替代正则化方法来提升扩散模型的判别特征表示。

Method: 提出线性可分性（LSEP）正则化，通过促进中间层表示的线性可分性，将线性探测直接融入网络学习过程，无需辅助编码器和表示对齐。

Result: 在基于流的Transformer架构（如SiTs）上，训练效率和生成质量均有显著提升，在256×256 ImageNet数据集上达到1.46的FID分数。

Conclusion: LSEP方法有效替代了基于对齐的方法，无需外部编码器，同时提升了扩散模型的表示质量和训练效率。

Abstract: Efficient training strategies for large-scale diffusion models have recently
emphasized the importance of improving discriminative feature representations
in these models. A central line of work in this direction is representation
alignment with features obtained from powerful external encoders, which
improves the representation quality as assessed through linear probing.
Alignment-based approaches show promise but depend on large pretrained
encoders, which are computationally expensive to obtain. In this work, we
propose an alternative regularization for training, based on promoting the
Linear SEParability (LSEP) of intermediate layer representations. LSEP
eliminates the need for an auxiliary encoder and representation alignment,
while incorporating linear probing directly into the network's learning
dynamics rather than treating it as a simple post-hoc evaluation tool. Our
results demonstrate substantial improvements in both training efficiency and
generation quality on flow-based transformer architectures such as SiTs,
achieving an FID of 1.46 on $256 \times 256$ ImageNet dataset.

<details>

Motivation: 现有对比学习方法忽略了地理空间中的空间依赖性，导致无法有效处理假负例（视觉和地理相似但被标记为负例的图像对）和难负例（视觉相似但地理距离远的图像对）。

Method: 使用半变异函数（一种地统计工具）建模特征空间距离与地理距离的关系，定义给定空间距离下的预期视觉差异作为参考来识别难负例和假负例。

Result: 在OSV5M数据集上评估，显示显式建模空间先验能提升图像地理定位性能，特别是在更细粒度级别。

Conclusion: 通过整合空间正则化策略，能够更有效地处理地理定位中的空间依赖性问题，提升定位精度。

Abstract: Accurate and robust image-based geo-localization at a global scale is
challenging due to diverse environments, visually ambiguous scenes, and the
lack of distinctive landmarks in many regions. While contrastive learning
methods show promising performance by aligning features between street-view
images and corresponding locations, they neglect the underlying spatial
dependency in the geographic space. As a result, they fail to address the issue
of false negatives -- image pairs that are both visually and geographically
similar but labeled as negatives, and struggle to effectively distinguish hard
negatives, which are visually similar but geographically distant. To address
this issue, we propose a novel spatially regularized contrastive learning
strategy that integrates a semivariogram, which is a geostatistical tool for
modeling how spatial correlation changes with distance. We fit the
semivariogram by relating the distance of images in feature space to their
geographical distance, capturing the expected visual content in a spatial
correlation. With the fitted semivariogram, we define the expected visual
dissimilarity at a given spatial distance as reference to identify hard
negatives and false negatives. We integrate this strategy into GeoCLIP and
evaluate it on the OSV5M dataset, demonstrating that explicitly modeling
spatial priors improves image-based geo-localization performance, particularly
at finer granularity.

Abstract: We introduce X-Streamer, an end-to-end multimodal human world modeling
framework for building digital human agents capable of infinite interactions
across text, speech, and video within a single unified architecture. Starting
from a single portrait, X-Streamer enables real-time, open-ended video calls
driven by streaming multimodal inputs. At its core is a Thinker-Actor
dual-transformer architecture that unifies multimodal understanding and
generation, turning a static portrait into persistent and intelligent
audiovisual interactions. The Thinker module perceives and reasons over
streaming user inputs, while its hidden states are translated by the Actor into
synchronized multimodal streams in real time. Concretely, the Thinker leverages
a pretrained large language-speech model, while the Actor employs a chunk-wise
autoregressive diffusion model that cross-attends to the Thinker's hidden
states to produce time-aligned multimodal responses with interleaved discrete
text and audio tokens and continuous video latents. To ensure long-horizon
stability, we design inter- and intra-chunk attentions with time-aligned
multimodal positional embeddings for fine-grained cross-modality alignment and
context retention, further reinforced by chunk-wise diffusion forcing and
global identity referencing. X-Streamer runs in real time on two A100 GPUs,
sustaining hours-long consistent video chat experiences from arbitrary
portraits and paving the way toward unified world modeling of interactive
digital humans.

Motivation: 解决从单张图像预测物体运动的问题，无需观察物体速度或作用力等其他参数，克服现有视频生成器在物理场景中预测运动的局限性。

Method: 采用条件生成密集轨迹网格的模型架构，类似于现代视频生成器但输出运动轨迹而非像素，直接建模运动而非生成像素。

Conclusion: 直接建模运动轨迹比生成像素更有效地预测物体运动，解决了视频生成器在简单物理场景中预测运动的困难。

Abstract: We consider the problem of forecasting motion from a single image, i.e.,
predicting how objects in the world are likely to move, without the ability to
observe other parameters such as the object velocities or the forces applied to
them. We formulate this task as conditional generation of dense trajectory
grids with a model that closely follows the architecture of modern video
generators but outputs motion trajectories instead of pixels. This approach
captures scene-wide dynamics and uncertainty, yielding more accurate and
diverse predictions than prior regressors and generators. We extensively
evaluate our method on simulated data, demonstrate its effectiveness on
downstream applications such as robotics, and show promising accuracy on
real-world intuitive physics datasets. Although recent state-of-the-art video
generators are often regarded as world models, we show that they struggle with
forecasting motion from a single image, even in simple physical scenarios such
as falling blocks or mechanical object interactions, despite fine-tuning on
such data. We show that this limitation arises from the overhead of generating
pixels rather than directly modeling motion.

TL;DR: 对比分析DINOv3和V-JEPA2两种自监督学习架构在视频动作识别中的表现，发现DINOv3在空间特征提取方面表现优异，特别擅长姿态识别，而V-JEPA2通过时间建模在所有动作类型上表现更稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解不同自监督学习架构在视频动作识别中的性能差异，为基于任务需求和可靠性约束选择合适的特征提取方法提供实证指导。

Method: 在UCF Sports数据集上评估两种架构，通过分类准确率、聚类性能、类内一致性和类间区分度等多个维度分析特征质量。

Result: DINOv3在聚类性能（轮廓分数0.31 vs 0.21）和区分能力（6.16倍分离比）方面更优，特别擅长姿态识别动作；V-JEPA2在所有动作类型上表现更稳定，性能方差显著更低（0.094 vs 0.288）。

Conclusion: DINOv3的空间处理架构擅长静态姿态识别但在运动依赖动作上表现下降，V-JEPA2的时间建模在不同动作类别间提供更平衡的表示质量，这些发现有助于理解视频分析系统中的架构设计选择。

Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of two prominent
self-supervised learning architectures for video action recognition: DINOv3,
which processes frames independently through spatial feature extraction, and
V-JEPA2, which employs joint temporal modeling across video sequences. We
evaluate both approaches on the UCF Sports dataset, examining feature quality
through multiple dimensions including classification accuracy, clustering
performance, intra-class consistency, and inter-class discrimination. Our
analysis reveals fundamental architectural trade-offs: DINOv3 achieves superior
clustering performance (Silhouette score: 0.31 vs 0.21) and demonstrates
exceptional discrimination capability (6.16x separation ratio) particularly for
pose-identifiable actions, while V-JEPA2 exhibits consistent reliability across
all action types with significantly lower performance variance (0.094 vs
0.288). Through action-specific evaluation, we identify that DINOv3's spatial
processing architecture excels at static pose recognition but shows degraded
performance on motion-dependent actions, whereas V-JEPA2's temporal modeling
provides balanced representation quality across diverse action categories.
These findings contribute to the understanding of architectural design choices
in video analysis systems and provide empirical guidance for selecting
appropriate feature extraction methods based on task requirements and
reliability constraints.

Motivation: 传统灾害评估方法缓慢危险，现有计算机视觉方法只能提供分类标签或分割掩码，无法提供全面的情境理解。

Method: 采用双架构方法：CNN-LSTM模型（基于ResNet50在EuroSat数据集预训练）处理xBD卫星图像，Vision Transformer模型处理RescueNet无人机图像，结合ConceptNet和WordNet的外部语义知识扩展词汇覆盖。

Conclusion: 双架构系统在通过自动生成信息密集的描述来改进灾害破坏评估方面显示出巨大潜力。

Abstract: Immediate damage assessment is essential after natural catastrophes; yet,
conventional hand evaluation techniques are sluggish and perilous. Although
satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photos offer extensive perspectives
of impacted regions, current computer vision methodologies generally yield just
classification labels or segmentation masks, so constraining their capacity to
deliver a thorough situational comprehension. We introduce the Vision Language
Caption Enhancer (VLCE), a multimodal system designed to produce comprehensive,
contextually-informed explanations of disaster imagery. VLCE employs a
dual-architecture approach: a CNN-LSTM model with a ResNet50 backbone
pretrained on EuroSat satellite imagery for the xBD dataset, and a Vision
Transformer (ViT) model pretrained on UAV pictures for the RescueNet dataset.
Both systems utilize external semantic knowledge from ConceptNet and WordNet to
expand vocabulary coverage and improve description accuracy. We assess VLCE in

### [42] [A Data-driven Typology of Vision Models from Integrated Representational Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21628)
*Jialin Wu,Shreya Saha,Yiqing Bo,Meenakshi Khosla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于表征相似性度量的框架来分析不同视觉模型家族间的表征差异，发现几何结构和单元调谐能有效区分模型家族，而线性可解码信息则更普遍共享。通过相似性网络融合方法实现了更好的家族分离。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉模型在架构和训练范式上差异很大，但缺乏系统方法来识别哪些表征方面是跨家族共享的，哪些反映了独特的计算策略。

Method: 使用多种表征相似性度量（几何、单元调谐、线性可解码性），并采用相似性网络融合方法整合这些互补的度量维度。

Result: 几何和调谐相关度量能强区分模型家族，而线性预测性度量区分较弱。融合方法显著提高了家族分离效果，发现监督ResNets和ViTs形成不同簇，但所有自监督模型跨架构边界聚集。

Conclusion: 该生物学启发的框架为视觉模型提供了原则性分类，表明由架构和训练目标共同塑造的新兴计算策略定义了超越表面设计类别的表征结构。

Abstract: Large vision models differ widely in architecture and training paradigm, yet
we lack principled methods to determine which aspects of their representations
are shared across families and which reflect distinctive computational
strategies. We leverage a suite of representational similarity metrics, each
capturing a different facet-geometry, unit tuning, or linear decodability-and
assess family separability using multiple complementary measures. Metrics
preserving geometry or tuning (e.g., RSA, Soft Matching) yield strong family
discrimination, whereas flexible mappings such as Linear Predictivity show
weaker separation. These findings indicate that geometry and tuning carry
family-specific signatures, while linearly decodable information is more
broadly shared. To integrate these complementary facets, we adapt Similarity
Network Fusion (SNF), a method inspired by multi-omics integration. SNF
achieves substantially sharper family separation than any individual metric and
produces robust composite signatures. Clustering of the fused similarity matrix
recovers both expected and surprising patterns: supervised ResNets and ViTs
form distinct clusters, yet all self-supervised models group together across
architectural boundaries. Hybrid architectures (ConvNeXt, Swin) cluster with
masked autoencoders, suggesting convergence between architectural modernization
and reconstruction-based training. This biology-inspired framework provides a
principled typology of vision models, showing that emergent computational
strategies-shaped jointly by architecture and training objective-define
representational structure beyond surface design categories.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FantasyWorld是一个几何增强框架，通过向冻结的视频基础模型添加可训练的几何分支，实现视频潜在空间和隐式3D场的联合建模，从而生成空间一致的3D感知视频表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频基础模型缺乏明确的3D基础能力，限制了空间一致性和下游3D推理任务的实用性。高质量3D世界模型对于具身智能和AGI至关重要。

Method: 引入跨分支监督机制，几何线索指导视频生成，视频先验正则化3D预测，在单次前向传播中联合建模视频潜在空间和隐式3D场。

Result: 实验表明FantasyWorld有效桥接视频想象和3D感知，在多视角一致性和风格一致性方面优于现有几何一致性基线。

Conclusion: 该框架通过统一主干和跨分支信息交换实现了视频想象与3D感知的有效结合，几何分支的潜在表示可作为下游3D任务的通用表示。

Abstract: High-quality 3D world models are pivotal for embodied intelligence and
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), underpinning applications such as AR/VR
content creation and robotic navigation. Despite the established strong
imaginative priors, current video foundation models lack explicit 3D grounding
capabilities, thus being limited in both spatial consistency and their utility
for downstream 3D reasoning tasks. In this work, we present FantasyWorld, a
geometry-enhanced framework that augments frozen video foundation models with a
trainable geometric branch, enabling joint modeling of video latents and an
implicit 3D field in a single forward pass. Our approach introduces
cross-branch supervision, where geometry cues guide video generation and video
priors regularize 3D prediction, thus yielding consistent and generalizable
3D-aware video representations. Notably, the resulting latents from the
geometric branch can potentially serve as versatile representations for
downstream 3D tasks such as novel view synthesis and navigation, without
requiring per-scene optimization or fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show
that FantasyWorld effectively bridges video imagination and 3D perception,
outperforming recent geometry-consistent baselines in multi-view coherence and
style consistency. Ablation studies further confirm that these gains stem from
the unified backbone and cross-branch information exchange.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MORPH是一个形状无关、自回归的偏微分方程基础模型，能够处理异构时空数据集，支持1D-3D不同维度和分辨率的数据，以及混合标量和矢量场的多物理场问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决科学机器学习中处理异构、多模态数据的挑战，为偏微分方程提供可扩展且数据高效的学习框架。

Method: 基于卷积视觉Transformer架构，结合组件卷积、场间交叉注意力和轴向注意力，通过预训练和参数高效微调（LoRA）实现迁移学习。

Result: 在多个下游预测任务中，MORPH在零样本和全样本泛化方面均优于从头训练的模型，匹配或超越现有最优模型。

Conclusion: MORPH为处理科学观测数据的异构性和多模态特性提供了灵活强大的基础架构，推动了可扩展科学机器学习的发展。

Abstract: We introduce MORPH, a shape-agnostic, autoregressive foundation model for
partial differential equations (PDEs). MORPH is built on a convolutional vision
transformer backbone that seamlessly handles heterogeneous spatiotemporal
datasets of varying data dimensionality (1D--3D) at different resolutions,
multiple fields with mixed scalar and vector components. The architecture
combines (i) component-wise convolution, which jointly processes scalar and
vector channels to capture local interactions, (ii) inter-field
cross-attention, which models and selectively propagates information between
different physical fields, (iii) axial attentions, which factorizes full
spatiotemporal self-attention along individual spatial and temporal axes to
reduce computational burden while retaining expressivity. We pretrain multiple
model variants on a diverse collection of heterogeneous PDE datasets and
evaluate transfer to a range of downstream prediction tasks. Using both
full-model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient low-rank adapters (LoRA), MORPH
outperforms models trained from scratch in both zero-shot and full-shot
generalization. Across extensive evaluations, MORPH matches or surpasses strong
baselines and recent state-of-the-art models. Collectively, these capabilities
present a flexible and powerful backbone for learning from heterogeneous and
multimodal nature of scientific observations, charting a path toward scalable
and data-efficient scientific machine learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外成像在低光和恶劣天气条件下具有优势，但类别不平衡、热噪声和计算限制等挑战影响模型性能，需要开发高效准确的检测方法。

Method: 基于YOLOv8，用MobileNetV4替换CSPDarknet骨干网络减少计算量，并引入SlideLoss损失函数动态强调欠代表和遮挡样本。

Result: MS-YOLO在FLIR ADAS V2基准测试中达到竞争性mAP和优越精度，仅需6.7 GFLOPs计算量，计算开销减少1.5%。

Conclusion: MS-YOLO有效解决了在保持高检测质量的同时最小化计算成本的双重挑战，适合城市环境中的实时边缘部署。

Abstract: Infrared imaging has emerged as a robust solution for urban object detection
under low-light and adverse weather conditions, offering significant advantages
over traditional visible-light cameras. However, challenges such as class
imbalance, thermal noise, and computational constraints can significantly
hinder model performance in practical settings. To address these issues, we
evaluate multiple YOLO variants on the FLIR ADAS V2 dataset, ultimately
selecting YOLOv8 as our baseline due to its balanced accuracy and efficiency.
Building on this foundation, we present \texttt{MS-YOLO} (\textbf{M}obileNetv4
and \textbf{S}lideLoss based on YOLO), which replaces YOLOv8's CSPDarknet
backbone with the more efficient MobileNetV4, reducing computational overhead
by \textbf{1.5%} while sustaining high accuracy. In addition, we introduce
\emph{SlideLoss}, a novel loss function that dynamically emphasizes
under-represented and occluded samples, boosting precision without sacrificing
recall. Experiments on the FLIR ADAS V2 benchmark show that \texttt{MS-YOLO}
attains competitive mAP and superior precision while operating at only
\textbf{6.7 GFLOPs}. These results demonstrate that \texttt{MS-YOLO}
effectively addresses the dual challenge of maintaining high detection quality
while minimizing computational costs, making it well-suited for real-time edge
deployment in urban environments.

TL;DR: 提出了Motion-Aware Transformer (MATR)，通过显式预测跨帧物体运动来提前更新跟踪查询，减少查询冲突，在多目标跟踪任务中取得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的DETR-based多目标跟踪框架通常在单个Transformer解码器层中联合处理检测和跟踪查询，导致查询冲突和关联精度下降。

Method: 引入运动感知Transformer，显式预测物体跨帧运动来提前更新跟踪查询，减少查询碰撞，实现更一致的训练。

Result: 在DanceTrack上HOTA提升超过9分，达到71.3的SOTA；在SportsMOT上72.2 HOTA，BDD100k上54.7 mTETA和41.6 mHOTA，均为SOTA结果。

Conclusion: 在端到端Transformer中显式建模运动为多目标跟踪提供了一种简单而高效的方法。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) in videos remains challenging due to complex
object motions and crowded scenes. Recent DETR-based frameworks offer
end-to-end solutions but typically process detection and tracking queries
jointly within a single Transformer Decoder layer, leading to conflicts and
degraded association accuracy. We introduce the Motion-Aware Transformer
(MATR), which explicitly predicts object movements across frames to update
track queries in advance. By reducing query collisions, MATR enables more
consistent training and improves both detection and association. Extensive
experiments on DanceTrack, SportsMOT, and BDD100k show that MATR delivers
significant gains across standard metrics. On DanceTrack, MATR improves HOTA by
more than 9 points over MOTR without additional data and reaches a new
state-of-the-art score of 71.3 with supplementary data. MATR also achieves
state-of-the-art results on SportsMOT (72.2 HOTA) and BDD100k (54.7 mTETA, 41.6
mHOTA) without relying on external datasets. These results demonstrate that
explicitly modeling motion within end-to-end Transformers offers a simple yet
highly effective approach to advancing multi-object tracking.

Conclusion: DynaNav框架有效解决了视觉导航中的计算效率和可解释性问题，为资源受限场景提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual navigation is essential for robotics and embodied AI. However,
existing foundation models, particularly those with transformer decoders,
suffer from high computational overhead and lack interpretability, limiting
their deployment in resource-tight scenarios. To address this, we propose
DynaNav, a Dynamic Visual Navigation framework that adapts feature and layer
selection based on scene complexity. It employs a trainable hard feature
selector for sparse operations, enhancing efficiency and interpretability.
Additionally, we integrate feature selection into an early-exit mechanism, with
Bayesian Optimization determining optimal exit thresholds to reduce
computational cost. Extensive experiments in real-world-based datasets and
simulated environments demonstrate the effectiveness of DynaNav. Compared to
ViNT, DynaNav achieves a 2.26x reduction in FLOPs, 42.3% lower inference time,
and 32.8% lower memory usage, while improving navigation performance across
four public datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeLiVR是一种高效的视频去雨方法，通过将时空李群微分偏差直接注入网络注意力分数中，解决了视频中的雨纹、模糊和噪声问题，同时确保时空一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 野外拍摄的视频常受雨纹、模糊和噪声影响，且相机姿态的微小变化会放大跨帧不匹配和时间伪影。现有方法依赖光流或启发式对齐，计算成本高且鲁棒性差。

Method: 提出DeLiVR方法，包含两个互补组件：1) 旋转有界的李相对偏差，通过紧凑预测模块预测每帧的平面内角度，实现几何一致性对齐；2) 微分群位移，计算相邻帧间角度差异来估计速度，结合时间衰减和注意力掩码关注帧间关系。

Result: 在公开基准测试上的广泛实验结果表明该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 李群为视频建模中的时空一致性提供了原则性表示方法，DeLiVR通过注入李群微分偏差有效解决了视频去雨问题。

Abstract: Videos captured in the wild often suffer from rain streaks, blur, and noise.
In addition, even slight changes in camera pose can amplify cross-frame
mismatches and temporal artifacts. Existing methods rely on optical flow or
heuristic alignment, which are computationally expensive and less robust. To
address these challenges, Lie groups provide a principled way to represent
continuous geometric transformations, making them well-suited for enforcing
spatial and temporal consistency in video modeling. Building on this insight,
we propose DeLiVR, an efficient video deraining method that injects
spatiotemporal Lie-group differential biases directly into attention scores of
the network. Specifically, the method introduces two complementary components.
First, a rotation-bounded Lie relative bias predicts the in-plane angle of each
frame using a compact prediction module, where normalized coordinates are
rotated and compared with base coordinates to achieve geometry-consistent
alignment before feature aggregation. Second, a differential group displacement
computes angular differences between adjacent frames to estimate a velocity.
This bias computation combines temporal decay and attention masks to focus on
inter-frame relationships while precisely matching the direction of rain
streaks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method on publicly available benchmarks.

and a custom clinical dataset show competitive accuracy and improved robustness
compared to state-of-the-art VLMs, demonstrating its potential for applications
in robot-assisted surgery, patient monitoring, and decision support.

TL;DR: 本文研究了基础AI/ML模型在合成孔径雷达(SAR)目标识别任务中的可行性，通过自监督学习微调公开可用的SSL模型，开发了AFRL-DINOv2系列模型，在SAR基础模型方面达到了新的最先进水平。

Motivation: 受到自然图像领域基础模型巨大进展的启发，这些模型通过自监督学习在web规模数据集上训练，具有下游任务适应性强、对分布偏移更鲁棒、特征可迁移性好等优势，作者希望将这种技术应用到SAR领域。

Method: 首先测试现有最强大的视觉基础模型(DINOv2、DINOv3、PE-Core)在SAR目标识别中的表现，然后通过自监督学习使用SAR数据对公开可用的SSL模型进行微调，开发了AFRL-DINOv2系列模型。

Result: AFRL-DINOv2模型显著超越了当前最好的SAR领域模型SARATR-X，建立了SAR基础模型的新最先进水平。实验还分析了不同骨干网络和下游任务适应策略的性能权衡。

Conclusion: 自监督微调公开SSL模型是SAR基础模型发展的可行路径，虽然取得了积极成果，但在SAR基础模型建设方面仍有很长的路要走。

Abstract: In this work we investigate the viability of foundational AI/ML models for
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object recognition tasks. We are inspired by the
tremendous progress being made in the wider community, particularly in the
natural image domain where frontier labs are training huge models on web-scale
datasets with unprecedented computing budgets. It has become clear that these
models, often trained with Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), will transform how
we develop AI/ML solutions for object recognition tasks - they can be adapted
downstream with very limited labeled data, they are more robust to many forms
of distribution shift, and their features are highly transferable
out-of-the-box. For these reasons and more, we are motivated to apply this
technology to the SAR domain. In our experiments we first run tests with
today's most powerful visual foundational models, including DINOv2, DINOv3 and
PE-Core and observe their shortcomings at extracting semantically-interesting
discriminative SAR target features when used off-the-shelf. We then show that
Self-Supervised finetuning of publicly available SSL models with SAR data is a
viable path forward by training several AFRL-DINOv2s and setting a new
state-of-the-art for SAR foundation models, significantly outperforming today's
best SAR-domain model SARATR-X. Our experiments further analyze the performance
trade-off of using different backbones with different downstream
task-adaptation recipes, and we monitor each model's ability to overcome
challenges within the downstream environments (e.g., extended operating
conditions and low amounts of labeled data). We hope this work will inform and
inspire future SAR foundation model builders, because despite our positive
results, we still have a long way to go.

Conclusion: UISim为UI测试、快速原型设计和合成数据生成提供了实用价值，其交互能力为AI代理的UI导航任务规划等高级应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Developing and testing user interfaces (UIs) and training AI agents to
interact with them are challenging due to the dynamic and diverse nature of
real-world mobile environments. Existing methods often rely on cumbersome
physical devices or limited static analysis of screenshots, which hinders
scalable testing and the development of intelligent UI agents. We introduce
UISim, a novel image-based UI simulator that offers a dynamic and interactive
platform for exploring mobile phone environments purely from screen images. Our
system employs a two-stage method: given an initial phone screen image and a
user action, it first predicts the abstract layout of the next UI state, then
synthesizes a new, visually consistent image based on this predicted layout.
This approach enables the realistic simulation of UI transitions. UISim
provides immediate practical benefits for UI testing, rapid prototyping, and
synthetic data generation. Furthermore, its interactive capabilities pave the
way for advanced applications, such as UI navigation task planning for AI
agents. Our experimental results show that UISim outperforms end-to-end UI
generation baselines in generating realistic and coherent subsequent UI states,
highlighting its fidelity and potential to streamline UI development and
enhance AI agent training.

Conclusion: MesaTask-10K数据集和MesaTask框架为解决任务导向的桌面场景生成问题提供了有效方案，弥合了任务指令与具体场景之间的语义鸿沟。

Abstract: The ability of robots to interpret human instructions and execute
manipulation tasks necessitates the availability of task-relevant tabletop
scenes for training. However, traditional methods for creating these scenes
rely on time-consuming manual layout design or purely randomized layouts, which
are limited in terms of plausibility or alignment with the tasks. In this
paper, we formulate a novel task, namely task-oriented tabletop scene
generation, which poses significant challenges due to the substantial gap
between high-level task instructions and the tabletop scenes. To support
research on such a challenging task, we introduce MesaTask-10K, a large-scale
dataset comprising approximately 10,700 synthetic tabletop scenes with manually
crafted layouts that ensure realistic layouts and intricate inter-object
relations. To bridge the gap between tasks and scenes, we propose a Spatial
Reasoning Chain that decomposes the generation process into object inference,
spatial interrelation reasoning, and scene graph construction for the final 3D
layout. We present MesaTask, an LLM-based framework that utilizes this
reasoning chain and is further enhanced with DPO algorithms to generate
physically plausible tabletop scenes that align well with given task
descriptions. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of
MesaTask compared to baselines in generating task-conforming tabletop scenes
with realistic layouts. Project page is at https://mesatask.github.io/

Abstract: Lightweight retinal vessel segmentation is important for the early diagnosis
of vision-threatening and systemic diseases, especially in a real-world
clinical environment with limited computational resources. Although

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法低估了视觉场景上下文信息在建模个体关系中的重要性，并且忽视了情感标签的语义信息对完整理解情感的关键作用。

Method: 包含视觉上下文编码模块（利用多尺度场景信息编码个体关系）和情感语义编码模块（使用群体级情感标签提示大语言模型生成细腻情感词汇，并通过结构化情感树精炼为全面语义表示），最后通过相似性感知交互对齐和整合视觉与语义信息。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的GER数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比最先进方法实现了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过有效整合视觉场景上下文和标签引导语义信息，显著提升了群体级情感识别的性能。

Abstract: Group-level emotion recognition (GER) aims to identify holistic emotions
within a scene involving multiple individuals. Current existed methods
underestimate the importance of visual scene contextual information in modeling
individual relationships. Furthermore, they overlook the crucial role of
semantic information from emotional labels for complete understanding of
emotions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that
incorporates visual scene context and label-guided semantic information to
improve GER performance. It involves the visual context encoding module that
leverages multi-scale scene information to diversely encode individual
relationships. Complementarily, the emotion semantic encoding module utilizes
group-level emotion labels to prompt a large language model to generate nuanced
emotion lexicons. These lexicons, in conjunction with the emotion labels, are
then subsequently refined into comprehensive semantic representations through
the utilization of a structured emotion tree. Finally, similarity-aware
interaction is proposed to align and integrate visual and semantic information,
thereby generating enhanced group-level emotion representations and
subsequently improving the performance of GER. Experiments on three widely
adopted GER datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 在多中心医学数据集上的实验显示，KG-SAM在前列腺分割中达到82.69%的平均Dice分数，在腹部分割中MRI达到78.05%，CT达到79.68%。

Conclusion: KG-SAM被证明是一个稳健且可推广的医学图像分割框架，显著提升了分割性能。

Abstract: While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has achieved remarkable success in
image segmentation, its direct application to medical imaging remains hindered
by fundamental challenges, including ambiguous boundaries, insufficient
modeling of anatomical relationships, and the absence of uncertainty
quantification. To address these limitations, we introduce KG-SAM, a
knowledge-guided framework that synergistically integrates anatomical priors
with boundary refinement and uncertainty estimation. Specifically, KG-SAM
incorporates (i) a medical knowledge graph to encode fine-grained anatomical
relationships, (ii) an energy-based Conditional Random Field (CRF) to enforce
anatomically consistent predictions, and (iii) an uncertainty-aware fusion
module to enhance reliability in high-stakes clinical scenarios. Extensive
experiments across multi-center medical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach: KG-SAM achieves an average Dice score of 82.69% on prostate
segmentation and delivers substantial gains in abdominal segmentation, reaching
78.05% on MRI and 79.68% on CT. These results establish KG-SAM as a robust and
generalizable framework for advancing medical image segmentation.

TL;DR: JanusVLN是一个新颖的视觉语言导航框架，采用双隐式神经记忆来建模空间几何和视觉语义记忆，解决了传统方法中的空间信息丢失、计算冗余和内存膨胀问题，在多个基准测试中达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VLN方法依赖显式语义记忆（如文本认知地图或历史视觉帧），存在空间信息丢失、计算冗余和内存膨胀等问题。受人类导航中隐式场景表示的启发，提出双隐式神经记忆框架来模拟左脑语义理解和右脑空间认知。

Method: 提出JanusVLN框架，包含双隐式神经记忆：1）扩展MLLM以融入空间几何编码器的3D先验知识，增强仅基于RGB输入的空间推理能力；2）构建空间几何和视觉语义编码器的历史键值缓存作为双隐式记忆；3）仅保留初始和滑动窗口中token的KVs，避免冗余计算，实现高效增量更新。

Result: 在广泛实验中，JanusVLN超越了20多个最新方法，达到SOTA性能：相比使用多种数据类型输入的方法，成功率提升10.5-35.5；相比使用更多RGB训练数据的方法，成功率提升3.6-10.8。

Conclusion: 提出的双隐式神经记忆作为一种新颖范式，为未来VLN研究探索了有前景的新方向。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation requires an embodied agent to navigate through
unseen environments, guided by natural language instructions and a continuous
video stream. Recent advances in VLN have been driven by the powerful semantic
understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models. However, these methods
typically rely on explicit semantic memory, such as building textual cognitive
maps or storing historical visual frames. This type of method suffers from
spatial information loss, computational redundancy, and memory bloat, which
impede efficient navigation. Inspired by the implicit scene representation in
human navigation, analogous to the left brain's semantic understanding and the
right brain's spatial cognition, we propose JanusVLN, a novel VLN framework
featuring a dual implicit neural memory that models spatial-geometric and
visual-semantic memory as separate, compact, and fixed-size neural
representations. This framework first extends the MLLM to incorporate 3D prior
knowledge from the spatial-geometric encoder, thereby enhancing the spatial
reasoning capabilities of models based solely on RGB input. Then, the
historical key-value caches from the spatial-geometric and visual-semantic
encoders are constructed into a dual implicit memory. By retaining only the KVs
of tokens in the initial and sliding window, redundant computation is avoided,
enabling efficient incremental updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
JanusVLN outperforms over 20 recent methods to achieve SOTA performance. For
example, the success rate improves by 10.5-35.5 compared to methods using
multiple data types as input and by 3.6-10.8 compared to methods using more RGB
training data. This indicates that the proposed dual implicit neural memory, as
a novel paradigm, explores promising new directions for future VLN research.

*Lan Chen,Yuchao Gu,Qi Mao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniVid是一个基于预训练视频生成模型的统一视觉框架，通过将视觉任务表示为视觉句子，无需任务特定修改即可处理多种图像和视频任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受大语言模型统一处理多种任务的启发，希望探索预训练视频生成模型能否作为统一视觉基础模型，避免多模态多源预训练的高成本。

Method: 微调视频扩散Transformer，将任务表示为视觉句子，其中上下文序列定义任务和输出模态。通过反转视觉句子顺序可在理解和生成任务间切换。

Result: 尽管仅在自然视频数据上训练，UniVid在跨模态推理（图像+视频）和跨源任务（自然到标注数据）上均表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 预训练视频生成模型有潜力作为可扩展的统一视觉建模基础，为视觉任务提供更高效和灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models, trained on extensive corpora, successfully unify
diverse linguistic tasks within a single generative framework. Inspired by
this, recent works like Large Vision Model (LVM) extend this paradigm to vision
by organizing tasks into sequential visual sentences, where visual prompts
serve as the context to guide outputs. However, such modeling requires
task-specific pre-training across modalities and sources, which is costly and
limits scalability to unseen tasks. Given that pre-trained video generation
models inherently capture temporal sequence dependencies, we explore a more
unified and scalable alternative: can a pre-trained video generation model
adapt to diverse image and video tasks? To answer this, we propose UniVid, a
framework that fine-tunes a video diffusion transformer to handle various
vision tasks without task-specific modifications. Tasks are represented as
visual sentences, where the context sequence defines both the task and the
expected output modality. We evaluate the generalization of UniVid from two
perspectives: (1) cross-modal inference with contexts composed of both images
and videos, extending beyond LVM's uni-modal setting; (2) cross-source tasks
from natural to annotated data, without multi-source pre-training. Despite
being trained solely on natural video data, UniVid generalizes well in both
settings. Notably, understanding and generation tasks can easily switch by
simply reversing the visual sentence order in this paradigm. These findings
highlight the potential of pre-trained video generation models to serve as a
scalable and unified foundation for vision modeling. Our code will be released

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种保持空间完整性的token合并方法，解决了现代ViT架构中空间设计带来的token缩减挑战，在保持性能的同时实现加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代ViT骨干网络采用空间架构设计（如窗口注意力、分解相对位置编码等），这些架构对token缩减提出了新挑战，因为现有方法无法保持这些架构依赖的空间结构。

Method: 采用2D缩减策略强制结构化token布局、空间感知合并算法保持相对token位置、以及新颖的每维度最大幅度token表示来保留显著特征。

Result: 在空间和非空间架构上均取得最先进结果：SAM-H在COCO上实现1.25倍加速，仅损失0.7% mIOU；DeiT-B在ImageNet上实现1.15倍加速，无top-1准确率损失。

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，能够保持空间完整性，与空间架构无缝兼容，在保持性能的同时显著加速推理。

Abstract: Many modern ViT backbones adopt spatial architectural designs, such as window
attention, decomposed relative positional embeddings in SAM, and RoPE in
DINOv3. Such architectures impose new challenges on token reduction, as the
vast majority of existing methods fail to preserve the spatial structure these
architectures depend on. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective
token merging method that maintains spatial integrity, enabling seamless
compatibility with spatial architectures. We reconcile two seemingly
conflicting requirements: (i)exploiting the uneven information distribution
across the spatial layout while (ii)preserving the spatial structure
post-merging. Our approach employs (i)a 2D reduction strategy to enforce
structured token layouts, (ii)a spatial-aware merging algorithm that maintains
relative token positions, and (iii)a novel max-magnitude-per-dimension token
representation that preserves salient features. Our method demonstrates strong
performance both off-the-shelf and with fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art
results on spatial and non-spatial architectures across various vision tasks.
Specifically, we achieve 1.25x speedup on SAM-H with only 0.7% mIOU drop
evaluated on COCO off-the-shelf, and 1.15x speedup on DeiT-B with no top-1
accuracy drop on ImageNet within just one epoch of fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在多模态推理方面表现出色，但在多模态深度伪造检测中存在挑战，包括难以捕捉细微伪造线索、解决跨模态不一致性以及执行任务对齐检索。

Method: 提出GASP-ICL框架，包括：1）使用MDD适配的特征提取器检索对齐的图像-文本对构建候选集；2）设计图形结构泰勒自适应评分器（GSTAS）捕捉跨样本关系并传播查询对齐信号，生成判别性示例；3）精确选择语义对齐的任务相关演示，增强LVLMs的检测能力。

Result: 在四种伪造类型上的实验表明，GASP-ICL超越了强基线方法，在不进行LVLM微调的情况下实现了性能提升。

Conclusion: GASP-ICL通过训练免费的方式有效提升了多模态深度伪造检测的性能，证明了其在增强信息可靠性方面的价值。

Abstract: Multimodal deepfake detection (MDD) aims to uncover manipulations across
visual, textual, and auditory modalities, thereby reinforcing the reliability
of modern information systems. Although large vision-language models (LVLMs)
exhibit strong multimodal reasoning, their effectiveness in MDD is limited by
challenges in capturing subtle forgery cues, resolving cross-modal
inconsistencies, and performing task-aligned retrieval. To this end, we propose
Guided Adaptive Scorer and Propagation In-Context Learning (GASP-ICL), a
training-free framework for MDD. GASP-ICL employs a pipeline to preserve
semantic relevance while injecting task-aware knowledge into LVLMs. We leverage
an MDD-adapted feature extractor to retrieve aligned image-text pairs and build
a candidate set. We further design the Graph-Structured Taylor Adaptive Scorer
(GSTAS) to capture cross-sample relations and propagate query-aligned signals,
producing discriminative exemplars. This enables precise selection of
semantically aligned, task-relevant demonstrations, enhancing LVLMs for robust
MDD. Experiments on four forgery types show that GASP-ICL surpasses strong
baselines, delivering gains without LVLM fine-tuning.

Result: 在视频动作识别实验中，与最先进方法相比证明了方法的有效性

Conclusion: ProDA框架能够有效从多动作场景中分离指定动作，提升动作识别性能

Abstract: Action recognition is a fundamental task in video understanding. Existing
methods typically extract unified features to process all actions in one video,
which makes it challenging to model the interactions between different objects
in multi-action scenarios. To alleviate this issue, we explore disentangling
any specified actions from complex scenes as an effective solution. In this
paper, we propose Prompt-guided Disentangled Representation for Action
Recognition (ProDA), a novel framework that disentangles any specified actions
from a multi-action scene. ProDA leverages Spatio-temporal Scene Graphs (SSGs)
and introduces Dynamic Prompt Module (DPM) to guide a Graph Parsing Neural
Network (GPNN) in generating action-specific representations. Furthermore, we
design a video-adapted GPNN that aggregates information using dynamic weights.
Experiments in video action recognition demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach when compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Our code can be found

Abstract: The rise in harmful online content not only distorts public discourse but
also poses significant challenges to maintaining a healthy digital environment.
In response to this, we introduce a multimodal dataset uniquely crafted for
identifying hate in digital content. Central to our methodology is the
innovative application of watermarked, stability-enhanced, stable diffusion
techniques combined with the Digital Attention Analysis Module (DAAM). This
combination is instrumental in pinpointing the hateful elements within images,
thereby generating detailed hate attention maps, which are used to blur these
regions from the image, thereby removing the hateful sections of the image. We
release this data set as a part of the dehate shared task. This paper also
describes the details of the shared task. Furthermore, we present DeHater, a
vision-language model designed for multimodal dehatification tasks. Our
approach sets a new standard in AI-driven image hate detection given textual

Conclusion: MIRG-RL框架有效解决了多图像推理和定位中的跨图像模糊问题，显著提升了模型的跨图像推理能力。

Abstract: Multi-image reasoning and grounding require understanding complex cross-image
relationships at both object levels and image levels. Current Large Visual
Language Models (LVLMs) face two critical challenges: the lack of cross-image
reasoning capabilities and insufficient cross-image reference reward modeling.
To address these issues, we propose a unified framework - Multi-Image Reasoning
and Grounding with Reinforcement Learning (MIRG-RL). Specifically, our
two-stage training paradigm combines supervised fine-tuning with annotated
trajectories and image-aware reinforcement learning optimization, progressively
developing multi-image reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we innovatively
propose a method for constructing the trajectory data, which integrates
object-level and image-level annotation information, and use this method to
generate a lightweight reasoning-enhanced dataset. To effectively resolve
cross-image ambiguities, we design an image-aware RL policy with dual reward
functions for objects and images. Experiments demonstrate that MIRG-RL achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multi-image grounding benchmarks,
attaining 64.82% on cross-image reasoning tasks - exceeding the previous best
method by 1%. The code and dataset have been released at

Conclusion: LongScape框架通过混合方法和自适应分块机制，成功解决了长时程视频生成的稳定性问题，为高质量的具身操作数据生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Video-based world models hold significant potential for generating
high-quality embodied manipulation data. However, current video generation
methods struggle to achieve stable long-horizon generation: classical
diffusion-based approaches often suffer from temporal inconsistency and visual
drift over multiple rollouts, while autoregressive methods tend to compromise
on visual detail. To solve this, we introduce LongScape, a hybrid framework
that adaptively combines intra-chunk diffusion denoising with inter-chunk
autoregressive causal generation. Our core innovation is an action-guided,
variable-length chunking mechanism that partitions video based on the semantic
context of robotic actions. This ensures each chunk represents a complete,
coherent action, enabling the model to flexibly generate diverse dynamics. We
further introduce a Context-aware Mixture-of-Experts (CMoE) framework that
adaptively activates specialized experts for each chunk during generation,
guaranteeing high visual quality and seamless chunk transitions. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves stable and consistent
long-horizon generation over extended rollouts. Our code is available at:

Result: 在CALVIN基准上实现最先进的任务成功率和优越的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MoWM框架有效融合不同特征空间的优势，为具身规划研究提供有价值的见解。

Abstract: Embodied action planning is a core challenge in robotics, requiring models to
generate precise actions from visual observations and language instructions.
While video generation world models are promising, their reliance on
pixel-level reconstruction often introduces visual redundancies that hinder
action decoding and generalization. Latent world models offer a compact,
motion-aware representation, but overlook the fine-grained details critical for
precise manipulation. To overcome these limitations, we propose MoWM, a
mixture-of-world-model framework that fuses representations from hybrid world
models for embodied action planning. Our approach uses motion-aware
representations from a latent model as a high-level prior, which guides the
extraction of fine-grained visual features from the pixel space model. This
design allows MoWM to highlight the informative visual details needed for
action decoding. Extensive evaluations on the CALVIN benchmark demonstrate that
our method achieves state-of-the-art task success rates and superior
generalization. We also provide a comprehensive analysis of the strengths of
each feature space, offering valuable insights for future research in embodied
planning. The code is available at: https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/MoWM.

Result: 实验表明该方法在视频质量和轨迹可控性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DiTraj为DiT视频生成提供了简单有效的训练免费轨迹控制方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT)-based video generation models with 3D full
attention exhibit strong generative capabilities. Trajectory control represents
a user-friendly task in the field of controllable video generation. However,
existing methods either require substantial training resources or are
specifically designed for U-Net, do not take advantage of the superior
performance of DiT. To address these issues, we propose DiTraj, a simple but
effective training-free framework for trajectory control in text-to-video
generation, tailored for DiT. Specifically, first, to inject the object's
trajectory, we propose foreground-background separation guidance: we use the
Large Language Model (LLM) to convert user-provided prompts into foreground and
background prompts, which respectively guide the generation of foreground and
background regions in the video. Then, we analyze 3D full attention and explore
the tight correlation between inter-token attention scores and position
embedding. Based on this, we propose inter-frame Spatial-Temporal Decoupled
3D-RoPE (STD-RoPE). By modifying only foreground tokens' position embedding,
STD-RoPE eliminates their cross-frame spatial discrepancies, strengthening
cross-frame attention among them and thus enhancing trajectory control.
Additionally, we achieve 3D-aware trajectory control by regulating the density
of position embedding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms previous methods in both video quality and trajectory
controllability.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have advanced the field of question answering, but
multi-hop reasoning, where answers require combining evidence across multiple
passages, remains difficult. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of
retrieval strategies for multi-hop question answering within a
retrieval-augmented generation framework. We compare cosine similarity, maximal
marginal relevance, and a hybrid method that integrates dense embeddings with
lexical overlap and re-ranking. To further improve retrieval, we adapt the
EfficientRAG pipeline for query optimization, introducing token labeling and
iterative refinement while maintaining efficiency. Experiments on the HotpotQA
dataset show that the hybrid approach substantially outperforms baseline
methods, achieving a relative improvement of 50 percent in exact match and 47
percent in F1 score compared to cosine similarity. Error analysis reveals that
hybrid retrieval improves entity recall and evidence complementarity, while
remaining limited in handling distractors and temporal reasoning. Overall, the
results suggest that hybrid retrieval-augmented generation provides a practical
zero-shot solution for multi-hop question answering, balancing accuracy,
efficiency, and interpretability.

Conclusion: 该方法能够从任意视角和时间实例生成逼真的HDR渲染，为解决HDR动态新视角合成问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: High Dynamic Range Novel View Synthesis (HDR NVS) seeks to learn an HDR 3D
model from Low Dynamic Range (LDR) training images captured under conventional
imaging conditions. Current methods primarily focus on static scenes,
implicitly assuming all scene elements remain stationary and non-living.
However, real-world scenarios frequently feature dynamic elements, such as
moving objects, varying lighting conditions, and other temporal events, thereby
presenting a significantly more challenging scenario. To address this gap, we
propose a more realistic problem named HDR Dynamic Novel View Synthesis (HDR
DNVS), where the additional dimension ``Dynamic'' emphasizes the necessity of
jointly modeling temporal radiance variations alongside sophisticated 3D
translation between LDR and HDR. To tackle this complex, intertwined challenge,
we introduce HDR-4DGS, a Gaussian Splatting-based architecture featured with an
innovative dynamic tone-mapping module that explicitly connects HDR and LDR
domains, maintaining temporal radiance coherence by dynamically adapting
tone-mapping functions according to the evolving radiance distributions across
the temporal dimension. As a result, HDR-4DGS achieves both temporal radiance
consistency and spatially accurate color translation, enabling photorealistic
HDR renderings from arbitrary viewpoints and time instances. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that HDR-4DGS surpasses existing state-of-the-art
methods in both quantitative performance and visual fidelity. Source code will
be released.

Abstract: Reconstructing detailed hand avatars plays a crucial role in various
applications. While prior works have focused on capturing high-fidelity hand

struggle to generalize on low-resolution images. Multi-view image
super-resolution methods have been proposed to enforce 3D view consistency.

resolutions and are not applicable to articulated deformable hands. In this
paper, we propose SRHand (Super-Resolution Hand), the method for reconstructing
detailed 3D geometry as well as textured images of hands from low-resolution
images. SRHand leverages the advantages of implicit image representation with
explicit hand meshes. Specifically, we introduce a geometric-aware implicit
image function (GIIF) that learns detailed hand prior by upsampling the coarse
input images. By jointly optimizing the implicit image function and explicit 3D
hand shapes, our method preserves multi-view and pose consistency among
upsampled hand images, and achieves fine-detailed 3D reconstruction (wrinkles,
nails). In experiments using the InterHand2.6M and Goliath datasets, our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art image upsampling methods adapted to
hand datasets, and 3D hand reconstruction methods, quantitatively and
qualitatively. Project page: https://yunminjin2.github.io/projects/srhand

### [69] [Deepfakes: we need to re-think the concept of "real" images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21864)
*Janis Keuper,Margret Keuper*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文质疑当前AI生成图像检测研究过于关注"假"图像而忽视"真实"图像的定义和数据收集，指出现代智能手机拍摄的照片实际上也经过神经网络处理，与生成图像技术相似，呼吁重新思考"真实"图像的概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代图像生成模型的普及引发了对其负面社会影响的担忧，但当前检测方法主要依赖过时的低分辨率真实图像数据集，而现代摄影技术已发生根本性变化。

Method: 通过分析当前图像检测研究现状，指出其依赖ImageNet等老旧数据集的问题，并论证现代智能手机摄影使用的神经网络处理与图像生成技术具有相似性。

Result: 发现当前"假"图像检测方法存在根本性缺陷，因为它们基于对"真实"图像的过时理解，而现代摄影技术已经模糊了真实与生成图像的界限。

Conclusion: 需要重新定义"真实"图像的技术概念，建立新的基准数据集，并质疑检测"假"图像这一目标本身是否合理。

Abstract: The wide availability and low usability barrier of modern image generation
models has triggered the reasonable fear of criminal misconduct and negative
social implications. The machine learning community has been engaging this
problem with an extensive series of publications proposing algorithmic
solutions for the detection of "fake", e.g. entirely generated or partially
manipulated images. While there is undoubtedly some progress towards technical
solutions of the problem, we argue that current and prior work is focusing too
much on generative algorithms and "fake" data-samples, neglecting a clear
definition and data collection of "real" images. The fundamental question "what
is a real image?" might appear to be quite philosophical, but our analysis
shows that the development and evaluation of basically all current
"fake"-detection methods is relying on only a few, quite old low-resolution
datasets of "real" images like ImageNet. However, the technology for the
acquisition of "real" images, aka taking photos, has drastically evolved over
the last decade: Today, over 90% of all photographs are produced by smartphones
which typically use algorithms to compute an image from multiple inputs (over
time) from multiple sensors. Based on the fact that these image formation
algorithms are typically neural network architectures which are closely related
to "fake"-image generators, we state the position that today, we need to
re-think the concept of "real" images. The purpose of this position paper is to
raise the awareness of the current shortcomings in this active field of
research and to trigger an open discussion whether the detection of "fake"
images is a sound objective at all. At the very least, we need a clear
technical definition of "real" images and new benchmark datasets.

TL;DR: Aes-R1是一个基于强化学习的多模态美学评估框架，通过构建高质量的美学推理数据链和联合优化绝对评分与相对排序，提升多模态大语言模型在美学评估中的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型虽然适合图像美学评估，但由于缺乏多模态美学推理数据和美学判断的主观性，难以生成准确且可解释的美学判断。

Method: 提出Aes-R1框架，包含AesCoT管道构建高质量美学推理数据链，以及RAPO强化学习算法联合优化绝对评分回归和相对排序，使模型在评分前生成结构化解释。

Result: Aes-R1将基础模型的PLCC/SRCC平均提升了47.9%/34.8%，在有限监督和分布外场景下展现出稳健的泛化能力。

Conclusion: Aes-R1能够在统一框架中同时提升美学评分和推理能力，使多模态大语言模型能够生成有依据的解释和可信的评分。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are well suited to image aesthetic
assessment, as they can capture high-level aesthetic features leveraging their
cross-modal understanding capacity. However, the scarcity of multimodal
aesthetic reasoning data and the inherently subjective nature of aesthetic
judgment make it difficult for MLLMs to generate accurate aesthetic judgments
with interpretable rationales. To this end, we propose Aes-R1, a comprehensive
aesthetic reasoning framework with reinforcement learning (RL). Concretely,
Aes-R1 integrates a pipeline, AesCoT, to construct and filter high-quality
chain-of-thought aesthetic reasoning data used for cold-start. After teaching
the model to generate structured explanations prior to scoring, we then employ
the Relative-Absolute Policy Optimization (RAPO), a novel RL algorithm that
jointly optimizes absolute score regression and relative ranking order,
improving both per-image accuracy and cross-image preference judgments. Aes-R1
enables MLLMs to generate grounded explanations alongside faithful scores,
thereby enhancing aesthetic scoring and reasoning in a unified framework.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Aes-R1 improves the backbone's average
PLCC/SRCC by 47.9%/34.8%, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines of similar
size. More ablation studies validate Aes-R1's robust generalization under
limited supervision and in out-of-distribution scenarios.

TL;DR: StableDub是一个基于Stable-Diffusion的视觉配音框架，通过唇部习惯感知建模和遮挡鲁棒合成，解决了现有方法在唇部习惯相似性和遮挡处理方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉配音方法存在两个关键缺陷：(1)仅基于音频的驱动范式无法捕捉说话者特定的唇部习惯；(2)传统盲修复方法在处理遮挡时经常产生视觉伪影。

Method: 基于Stable-Diffusion骨干网络，开发唇部习惯调制机制，联合建模音视频同步和说话者口面部动态；引入遮挡感知训练策略，在修复过程中显式暴露遮挡对象；采用混合Mamba-Transformer架构优化训练效率。

Result: 实验结果表明StableDub在唇部习惯相似性和遮挡鲁棒性方面表现优异，在音频-唇部同步、视频质量和分辨率一致性方面超越其他方法。

Conclusion: StableDub通过创新的唇部习惯建模和遮挡处理机制，显著提升了视觉配音的性能和实用性，特别在低资源研究场景中表现出色。

Abstract: The visual dubbing task aims to generate mouth movements synchronized with
the driving audio, which has seen significant progress in recent years.
However, two critical deficiencies hinder their wide application: (1)
Audio-only driving paradigms inadequately capture speaker-specific lip habits,
which fail to generate lip movements similar to the target avatar; (2)
Conventional blind-inpainting approaches frequently produce visual artifacts
when handling obstructions (e.g., microphones, hands), limiting practical
deployment. In this paper, we propose StableDub, a novel and concise framework
integrating lip-habit-aware modeling with occlusion-robust synthesis.
Specifically, building upon the Stable-Diffusion backbone, we develop a
lip-habit-modulated mechanism that jointly models phonemic audio-visual
synchronization and speaker-specific orofacial dynamics. To achieve plausible
lip geometries and object appearances under occlusion, we introduce the
occlusion-aware training strategy by explicitly exposing the occlusion objects
to the inpainting process. By incorporating the proposed designs, the model
eliminates the necessity for cost-intensive priors in previous methods, thereby
exhibiting superior training efficiency on the computationally intensive
diffusion-based backbone. To further optimize training efficiency from the
perspective of model architecture, we introduce a hybrid Mamba-Transformer
architecture, which demonstrates the enhanced applicability in low-resource
research scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that StableDub
achieves superior performance in lip habit resemblance and occlusion
robustness. Our method also surpasses other methods in audio-lip sync, video
quality, and resolution consistency. We expand the applicability of visual
dubbing methods from comprehensive aspects, and demo videos can be found at

TL;DR: Drag4D是一个交互式框架，将物体运动控制集成到文本驱动的3D场景生成中，允许用户为3D对象定义轨迹并集成到高质量3D背景中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够将物体运动控制与3D场景生成相结合的系统，使用户能够交互式地定义3D轨迹并创建动态3D场景。

Method: 三阶段流程：1) 使用2D高斯泼溅和全景图像增强文本到3D背景生成；2) 3D复制粘贴方法，通过物理感知对象位置学习确保空间对齐；3) 使用部分增强的运动条件视频扩散模型进行时间动画。

Result: 实现了用户控制的物体运动与高质量3D背景的协调对齐，展示了统一的架构有效性。

Conclusion: Drag4D提供了一个有效的框架，用于在3D场景中集成交互式物体运动控制，实现了空间和时间上的精确对齐。

Abstract: We introduce Drag4D, an interactive framework that integrates object motion
control within text-driven 3D scene generation. This framework enables users to
define 3D trajectories for the 3D objects generated from a single image,
seamlessly integrating them into a high-quality 3D background. Our Drag4D
pipeline consists of three stages. First, we enhance text-to-3D background
generation by applying 2D Gaussian Splatting with panoramic images and
inpainted novel views, resulting in dense and visually complete 3D
reconstructions. In the second stage, given a reference image of the target
object, we introduce a 3D copy-and-paste approach: the target instance is
extracted in a full 3D mesh using an off-the-shelf image-to-3D model and
seamlessly composited into the generated 3D scene. The object mesh is then
positioned within the 3D scene via our physics-aware object position learning,
ensuring precise spatial alignment. Lastly, the spatially aligned object is
temporally animated along a user-defined 3D trajectory. To mitigate motion
hallucination and ensure view-consistent temporal alignment, we develop a
part-augmented, motion-conditioned video diffusion model that processes
multiview image pairs together with their projected 2D trajectories. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our unified architecture through evaluations
at each stage and in the final results, showcasing the harmonized alignment of
user-controlled object motion within a high-quality 3D background.

TL;DR: Syncphony是一个音频到视频生成模型，通过运动感知损失和音频同步引导技术，生成与音频精确同步的380x640分辨率、24fps视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到视频和图像到视频生成方法在控制运动时序方面存在局限，而音频提供了与视频运动对齐的时间线索，是时序控制视频生成的有前景条件。

Method: 基于预训练视频骨干网络，引入两个关键组件：1) 运动感知损失，强调在高运动区域学习；2) 音频同步引导，使用视觉对齐的无音频层模型引导完整模型，在推理时更好地利用音频线索同时保持视觉质量。

Result: 在AVSync15和The Greatest Hits数据集上的实验表明，Syncphony在同步精度和视觉质量方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Syncphony通过创新的运动感知损失和音频同步引导机制，成功实现了音频与视频的精细同步，为时序控制的视频生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-video and image-to-video generation have made rapid progress in
visual quality, but they remain limited in controlling the precise timing of
motion. In contrast, audio provides temporal cues aligned with video motion,
making it a promising condition for temporally controlled video generation.
However, existing audio-to-video (A2V) models struggle with fine-grained
synchronization due to indirect conditioning mechanisms or limited temporal
modeling capacity. We present Syncphony, which generates 380x640 resolution,
24fps videos synchronized with diverse audio inputs. Our approach builds upon a
pre-trained video backbone and incorporates two key components to improve
synchronization: (1) Motion-aware Loss, which emphasizes learning at
high-motion regions; (2) Audio Sync Guidance, which guides the full model using
a visually aligned off-sync model without audio layers to better exploit audio
cues at inference while maintaining visual quality. To evaluate
synchronization, we propose CycleSync, a video-to-audio-based metric that
measures the amount of motion cues in the generated video to reconstruct the
original audio. Experiments on AVSync15 and The Greatest Hits datasets
demonstrate that Syncphony outperforms existing methods in both synchronization
accuracy and visual quality. Project page is available at:

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的语言引导变化检测模型(LG-CD)，通过自然语言提示引导网络关注感兴趣区域，显著提高了变化检测的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数基于深度学习的方法主要关注学习单模态视觉信息，而忽略了文本等多模态数据提供的丰富语义信息。

Method: 使用视觉基础模型(SAM2)作为特征提取器捕获双时相遥感图像的多尺度金字塔特征，采用多层适配器进行下游任务微调，设计文本融合注意力模块(TFAM)对齐视觉和文本信息，通过视觉-语义融合解码器(V-SFD)深度整合视觉和语义信息。

Result: 在三个数据集(LEVIR-CD、WHU-CD和SYSU-CD)上的实验表明，LG-CD始终优于最先进的变化检测方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为利用多模态信息实现广义变化检测提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Remote Sensing Change Detection (RSCD) typically identifies changes in land
cover or surface conditions by analyzing multi-temporal images. Currently, most
deep learning-based methods primarily focus on learning unimodal visual
information, while neglecting the rich semantic information provided by
multimodal data such as text. To address this limitation, we propose a novel
Language-Guided Change Detection model (LG-CD). This model leverages natural
language prompts to direct the network's attention to regions of interest,
significantly improving the accuracy and robustness of change detection.
Specifically, LG-CD utilizes a visual foundational model (SAM2) as a feature
extractor to capture multi-scale pyramid features from high-resolution to
low-resolution across bi-temporal remote sensing images. Subsequently,
multi-layer adapters are employed to fine-tune the model for downstream tasks,
ensuring its effectiveness in remote sensing change detection. Additionally, we
design a Text Fusion Attention Module (TFAM) to align visual and textual
information, enabling the model to focus on target change regions using text
prompts. Finally, a Vision-Semantic Fusion Decoder (V-SFD) is implemented,
which deeply integrates visual and semantic information through a
cross-attention mechanism to produce highly accurate change detection masks.
Our experiments on three datasets (LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and SYSU-CD) demonstrate
that LG-CD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art change detection methods.
Furthermore, our approach provides new insights into achieving generalized
change detection by leveraging multimodal information.

Motivation: 文本驱动方法擅长纹理操作但缺乏精确空间控制，拖拽驱动方法主要修改形状和结构但缺乏细粒度纹理指导，需要结合两者的优势。

Method: 提出点云确定性拖拽增强潜在空间布局控制，以及拖拽-文本引导去噪在去噪过程中动态平衡拖拽和文本条件的影响。

Conclusion: 建立了一个多功能且可泛化的可控图像操作解决方案，支持灵活的编辑模式。

Abstract: This paper explores image editing under the joint control of text and drag
interactions. While recent advances in text-driven and drag-driven editing have
achieved remarkable progress, they suffer from complementary limitations:
text-driven methods excel in texture manipulation but lack precise spatial
control, whereas drag-driven approaches primarily modify shape and structure
without fine-grained texture guidance. To address these limitations, we propose
a unified diffusion-based framework for joint drag-text image editing,
integrating the strengths of both paradigms. Our framework introduces two key
innovations: (1) Point-Cloud Deterministic Drag, which enhances latent-space
layout control through 3D feature mapping, and (2) Drag-Text Guided Denoising,
dynamically balancing the influence of drag and text conditions during
denoising. Notably, our model supports flexible editing modes - operating with
text-only, drag-only, or combined conditions - while maintaining strong
performance in each setting. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments
demonstrate that our method not only achieves high-fidelity joint editing but
also matches or surpasses the performance of specialized text-only or drag-only
approaches, establishing a versatile and generalizable solution for
controllable image manipulation. Code will be made publicly available to
reproduce all results presented in this work.

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效利用未标注数据提升车辆检测性能，特别是在具有挑战性的北欧雪域环境中。

Abstract: Aside from common challenges in remote sensing like small, sparse targets and
computation cost limitations, detecting vehicles from UAV images in the Nordic
regions faces strong visibility challenges and domain shifts caused by diverse
levels of snow coverage. Although annotated data are expensive, unannotated
data is cheaper to obtain by simply flying the drones. In this work, we
proposed a sideload-CL-adaptation framework that enables the use of unannotated
data to improve vehicle detection using lightweight models. Specifically, we
propose to train a CNN-based representation extractor through contrastive
learning on the unannotated data in the pretraining stage, and then sideload it
to a frozen YOLO11n backbone in the fine-tuning stage. To find a robust
sideload-CL-adaptation, we conducted extensive experiments to compare various
fusion methods and granularity. Our proposed sideload-CL-adaptation model
improves the detection performance by 3.8% to 9.5% in terms of mAP50 on the NVD

Conclusion: IF-V2V方法成功实现了无需反转的高质量视频编辑，为视觉创意提供了有效的工具。

Abstract: Although image editing techniques have advanced significantly, video editing,
which aims to manipulate videos according to user intent, remains an emerging
challenge. Most existing image-conditioned video editing methods either require
inversion with model-specific design or need extensive optimization, limiting
their capability of leveraging up-to-date image-to-video (I2V) models to
transfer the editing capability of image editing models to the video domain. To
this end, we propose IF-V2V, an Inversion-Free method that can adapt
off-the-shelf flow-matching-based I2V models for video editing without
significant computational overhead. To circumvent inversion, we devise Vector
Field Rectification with Sample Deviation to incorporate information from the
source video into the denoising process by introducing a deviation term into
the denoising vector field. To further ensure consistency with the source video
in a model-agnostic way, we introduce Structure-and-Motion-Preserving
Initialization to generate motion-aware temporally correlated noise with
structural information embedded. We also present a Deviation Caching mechanism
to minimize the additional computational cost for denoising vector
rectification without significantly impacting editing quality. Evaluations
demonstrate that our method achieves superior editing quality and consistency
over existing approaches, offering a lightweight plug-and-play solution to
realize visual creativity.

Motivation: 传统多视角计数方法主要依赖全监督学习，需要大量标注数据。本文旨在通过自监督学习减轻对标注数据的依赖。

Method: 提出SSLCounter框架，利用神经体积渲染学习场景的隐式表示，通过微分神经渲染重建连续几何形状和复杂视角相关的外观。

Conclusion: SSLCounter通过自监督学习和神经体积渲染有效解决了多视角计数中对大规模标注数据的依赖问题，具有出色的数据效率和性能。

Abstract: Multi-view counting (MVC) methods have attracted significant research
attention and stimulated remarkable progress in recent years. Despite their
success, most MVC methods have focused on improving performance by following
the fully supervised learning (FSL) paradigm, which often requires large
amounts of annotated data. In this work, we propose SSLCounter, a novel
self-supervised learning (SSL) framework for MVC that leverages neural
volumetric rendering to alleviate the reliance on large-scale annotated
datasets. SSLCounter learns an implicit representation w.r.t. the scene,
enabling the reconstruction of continuous geometry shape and the complex,
view-dependent appearance of their 2D projections via differential neural
rendering. Owing to its inherent flexibility, the key idea of our method can be
seamlessly integrated into exsiting frameworks. Notably, extensive experiments
demonstrate that SSLCounter not only demonstrates state-of-the-art performances
but also delivers competitive performance with only using 70% proportion of
training data, showcasing its superior data efficiency across multiple MVC
benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个系统性基准来评估基础模型中的物体中心空间推理能力，发现检测器在精确定位方面表现良好但关系推理有限，而视觉语言模型能提供布局线索但缺乏细粒度空间上下文理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数基准测试强调定位准确性，而非模型是否真正理解场景中物体的排列和关系。有效的场景理解不仅需要识别物体，还需要推理它们的相对位置、分组和深度关系。

Method: 使用受控合成数据集，评估了最先进的视觉模型（如GroundingDINO、Florence-2、OWLv2）和大型视觉语言模型（如InternVL、LLaVA、GPT-4o）在三个任务上的表现：空间定位、空间推理和下游检索任务。

Result: 发现稳定的权衡关系：检测器如GroundingDINO和OWLv2提供精确的边界框但关系推理有限，而视觉语言模型如SmolVLM和GPT-4o提供粗略的布局线索和流畅的描述但在细粒度空间上下文方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了定位能力与真正空间理解之间的差距，并指出社区需要开发具有空间感知能力的基础模型。

Abstract: Spatial understanding is a critical capability for vision foundation models.
While recent advances in large vision models or vision-language models (VLMs)
have expanded recognition capabilities, most benchmarks emphasize localization
accuracy rather than whether models capture how objects are arranged and
related within a scene. This gap is consequential; effective scene
understanding requires not only identifying objects, but reasoning about their
relative positions, groupings, and depth. In this paper, we present a
systematic benchmark for object-centric spatial reasoning in foundation models.
Using a controlled synthetic dataset, we evaluate state-of-the-art vision
models (e.g., GroundingDINO, Florence-2, OWLv2) and large VLMs (e.g., InternVL,
LLaVA, GPT-4o) across three tasks: spatial localization, spatial reasoning, and
downstream retrieval tasks. We find a stable trade-off: detectors such as
GroundingDINO and OWLv2 deliver precise boxes with limited relational
reasoning, while VLMs like SmolVLM and GPT-4o provide coarse layout cues and
fluent captions but struggle with fine-grained spatial context. Our study
highlights the gap between localization and true spatial understanding, and
pointing toward the need for spatially-aware foundation models in the
community.

TL;DR: PANICL是一个无需训练的训练框架，通过利用多个上下文图像对来缓解视觉上下文学习中过度依赖单个上下文对的问题，从而提高预测的稳定性和减少偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉上下文学习(VICL)通常过度依赖单个上下文图像对，这会导致预测存在偏差和不稳定。

Method: 提出基于补丁的k近邻视觉上下文学习(PANICL)，通过平滑多个上下文对的分配分数来减少偏差，无需额外训练。

Result: 在多种视觉任务上（前景分割、目标检测、着色、多目标分割、关键点检测）相比强基线方法都取得了持续改进，并对领域偏移表现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PANICL是一个通用且广泛适用的框架，能够泛化到其他VICL模型，展现了其多功能性和广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) uses input-output image pairs, referred to
as in-context pairs (or examples), as prompts alongside query images to guide
models in performing diverse vision tasks. However, VICL often suffers from
over-reliance on a single in-context pair, which can lead to biased and
unstable predictions. We introduce PAtch-based $k$-Nearest neighbor visual
In-Context Learning (PANICL), a general training-free framework that mitigates
this issue by leveraging multiple in-context pairs. PANICL smooths assignment
scores across pairs, reducing bias without requiring additional training.
Extensive experiments on a variety of tasks, including foreground segmentation,
single object detection, colorization, multi-object segmentation, and keypoint
detection, demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines. Moreover,
PANICL exhibits strong robustness to domain shifts, including dataset-level
shift (e.g., from COCO to Pascal) and label-space shift (e.g., FSS-1000), and
generalizes well to other VICL models such as SegGPT, Painter, and LVM,
highlighting its versatility and broad applicability.

Conclusion: SingRef6D证明了仅使用单张RGB参考图像即可实现稳健的6D姿态估计，在资源受限和挑战性场景下表现优异，为实际应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Recent 6D pose estimation methods demonstrate notable performance but still
face some practical limitations. For instance, many of them rely heavily on
sensor depth, which may fail with challenging surface conditions, such as
transparent or highly reflective materials. In the meantime, RGB-based
solutions provide less robust matching performance in low-light and
texture-less scenes due to the lack of geometry information. Motivated by
these, we propose SingRef6D, a lightweight pipeline requiring only a single RGB
image as a reference, eliminating the need for costly depth sensors, multi-view
image acquisition, or training view synthesis models and neural fields. This
enables SingRef6D to remain robust and capable even under resource-limited
settings where depth or dense templates are unavailable. Our framework
incorporates two key innovations. First, we propose a token-scaler-based
fine-tuning mechanism with a novel optimization loss on top of Depth-Anything
v2 to enhance its ability to predict accurate depth, even for challenging
surfaces. Our results show a 14.41% improvement (in $\delta_{1.05}$) on REAL275
depth prediction compared to Depth-Anything v2 (with fine-tuned head). Second,
benefiting from depth availability, we introduce a depth-aware matching process
that effectively integrates spatial relationships within LoFTR, enabling our
system to handle matching for challenging materials and lighting conditions.
Evaluations of pose estimation on the REAL275, ClearPose, and Toyota-Light
datasets show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods, achieving a
6.1% improvement in average recall.

TL;DR: 提出了SemanticControl方法，无需训练即可有效利用未对齐但语义相关的视觉条件，通过自适应抑制视觉条件与文本提示冲突的部分，同时增强文本引导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ControlNet在视觉条件与文本提示未精确对齐时效果不佳的问题，特别是在不常见或想象性场景中，无法找到完全匹配的视觉条件。

Method: 首先使用与视觉条件对齐的替代提示进行辅助去噪过程以提取注意力掩码，然后在实际目标提示的去噪过程中利用这些掩码来抑制冲突区域并增强文本引导。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在各种视觉条件（深度图、边缘图、人体骨架）下，在未对齐条件下均优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: SemanticControl方法能够有效处理视觉条件与文本提示未对齐的情况，提高了生成图像的质量和文本保真度。

Abstract: ControlNet has enabled detailed spatial control in text-to-image diffusion
models by incorporating additional visual conditions such as depth or edge
maps. However, its effectiveness heavily depends on the availability of visual
conditions that are precisely aligned with the generation goal specified by
text prompt-a requirement that often fails in practice, especially for uncommon
or imaginative scenes. For example, generating an image of a cat cooking in a
specific pose may be infeasible due to the lack of suitable visual conditions.
In contrast, structurally similar cues can often be found in more common
settings-for instance, poses of humans cooking are widely available and can
serve as rough visual guides. Unfortunately, existing ControlNet models
struggle to use such loosely aligned visual conditions, often resulting in low
text fidelity or visual artifacts. To address this limitation, we propose
SemanticControl, a training-free method for effectively leveraging misaligned
but semantically relevant visual conditions. Our approach adaptively suppresses
the influence of the visual condition where it conflicts with the prompt, while
strengthening guidance from the text. The key idea is to first run an auxiliary
denoising process using a surrogate prompt aligned with the visual condition
(e.g., "a human playing guitar" for a human pose condition) to extract
informative attention masks, and then utilize these masks during the denoising
of the actual target prompt (e.g., cat playing guitar). Experimental results
demonstrate that our method improves performance under loosely aligned
conditions across various conditions, including depth maps, edge maps, and
human skeletons, outperforming existing baselines. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的视觉情感评估任务和自动化流程，用于评估多模态大语言模型的情感感知能力，发现现有模型在情感解释和基于情境的情感判断方面表现较好，但在理解感知主观性方面存在局限，与人类表现仍有显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在图像情感感知方面的能力存在争议，评估方法存在诸多限制，包括忽略合理回答、情感分类有限、忽视情境因素以及标注工作量大等问题。

Method: 提出了情感陈述判断任务，并设计了一个自动化流程来高效构建以情感为中心的陈述，最小化人工参与。

Result: 评估发现MLLMs在情感解释和基于情境的情感判断方面表现较强，但在理解感知主观性方面相对有限；与人类相比，即使是表现最好的GPT4o模型也存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: 通过开发基础评估框架并进行全面的MLLM评估，这项工作有助于推进MLLMs的情感智能发展。

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved exceptional
performance across diverse tasks, continually surpassing previous expectations
regarding their capabilities. Nevertheless, their proficiency in perceiving
emotions from images remains debated, with studies yielding divergent results
in zero-shot scenarios. We argue that this inconsistency stems partly from
constraints in existing evaluation methods, including the oversight of
plausible responses, limited emotional taxonomies, neglect of contextual
factors, and labor-intensive annotations. To facilitate customized visual
emotion evaluation for MLLMs, we propose an Emotion Statement Judgment task
that overcomes these constraints. Complementing this task, we devise an
automated pipeline that efficiently constructs emotion-centric statements with
minimal human effort. Through systematically evaluating prevailing MLLMs, our
study showcases their stronger performance in emotion interpretation and
context-based emotion judgment, while revealing relative limitations in
comprehending perception subjectivity. When compared to humans, even
top-performing MLLMs like GPT4o demonstrate remarkable performance gaps,
underscoring key areas for future improvement. By developing a fundamental
evaluation framework and conducting a comprehensive MLLM assessment, we hope
this work contributes to advancing emotional intelligence in MLLMs. Project

Result: 实验验证该框架显著提高了主体保真度，并更好地对齐了人类偏好。

Conclusion: MultiCrafter通过位置监督、MoE架构和强化学习有效解决了多主体图像生成中的属性泄露和偏好对齐问题。

Abstract: Multi-subject image generation aims to synthesize user-provided subjects in a
single image while preserving subject fidelity, ensuring prompt consistency,
and aligning with human aesthetic preferences. However, existing methods,
particularly those built on the In-Context-Learning paradigm, are limited by
their reliance on simple reconstruction-based objectives, leading to both
severe attribute leakage that compromises subject fidelity and failing to align
with nuanced human preferences. To address this, we propose MultiCrafter, a
framework that ensures high-fidelity, preference-aligned generation. First, we
find that the root cause of attribute leakage is a significant entanglement of
attention between different subjects during the generation process. Therefore,
we introduce explicit positional supervision to explicitly separate attention
regions for each subject, effectively mitigating attribute leakage. To enable
the model to accurately plan the attention region of different subjects in
diverse scenarios, we employ a Mixture-of-Experts architecture to enhance the
model's capacity, allowing different experts to focus on different scenarios.
Finally, we design a novel online reinforcement learning framework to align the
model with human preferences, featuring a scoring mechanism to accurately
assess multi-subject fidelity and a more stable training strategy tailored for
the MoE architecture. Experiments validate that our framework significantly
improves subject fidelity while aligning with human preferences better.

Abstract: Image contrast was a fundamental factor in visual perception and played a
vital role in overall image quality. However, most no reference image quality
assessment NR IQA models struggled to accurately evaluate contrast distortions
under diverse real world conditions. In this study, we proposed a deep learning
based framework for blind contrast quality assessment by customizing and
fine-tuning three pre trained architectures, EfficientNet B0, ResNet18, and
MobileNetV2, for perceptual Mean Opinion Score, along with an additional model
built on a Siamese network, which indicated a limited ability to capture
perceptual contrast distortions. Each model is modified with a contrast-aware
regression head and trained end to end using targeted data augmentations on two
benchmark datasets, CID2013 and CCID2014, containing synthetic and authentic
contrast distortions. Performance is evaluated using Pearson Linear Correlation
Coefficient and Spearman Rank Order Correlation Coefficient, which assess the
alignment between predicted and human rated scores. Among these three models,
our customized EfficientNet B0 model achieved state-of-the-art performance with
PLCC = 0.9286 and SRCC = 0.9178 on CCID2014 and PLCC = 0.9581 and SRCC = 0.9369
on CID2013, surpassing traditional methods and outperforming other deep
baselines. These results highlighted the models robustness and effectiveness in
capturing perceptual contrast distortion. Overall, the proposed method
demonstrated that contrast aware adaptation of lightweight pre trained networks
can yield a high performing, scalable solution for no reference contrast
quality assessment suitable for real time and resource constrained
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开放世界部件分割方法通常从2D基础模型迁移监督，但无法捕捉内在几何特征，导致仅表面理解、不受控分解和有限泛化能力。

Method: 采用基于三平面的双分支编码器生成空间结构化token，结合模型辅助标注流程构建大规模3D数据集，支持单提示精确部件识别和自动分解表面及内部结构。

Result: 在多个基准测试中大幅超越最先进方法，展示了新兴的开放世界能力，包括精确部件识别和自动形状分解。

Conclusion: PartSAM标志着向3D部件理解基础模型迈出的决定性一步，结合可扩展架构和多样化3D数据实现了强大的开放世界能力。

Abstract: Segmenting 3D objects into parts is a long-standing challenge in computer
vision. To overcome taxonomy constraints and generalize to unseen 3D objects,
recent works turn to open-world part segmentation. These approaches typically
transfer supervision from 2D foundation models, such as SAM, by lifting
multi-view masks into 3D. However, this indirect paradigm fails to capture
intrinsic geometry, leading to surface-only understanding, uncontrolled
decomposition, and limited generalization. We present PartSAM, the first
promptable part segmentation model trained natively on large-scale 3D data.
Following the design philosophy of SAM, PartSAM employs an encoder-decoder
architecture in which a triplane-based dual-branch encoder produces spatially
structured tokens for scalable part-aware representation learning. To enable
large-scale supervision, we further introduce a model-in-the-loop annotation
pipeline that curates over five million 3D shape-part pairs from online assets,
providing diverse and fine-grained labels. This combination of scalable
architecture and diverse 3D data yields emergent open-world capabilities: with
a single prompt, PartSAM achieves highly accurate part identification, and in a
Segment-Every-Part mode, it automatically decomposes shapes into both surface
and internal structures. Extensive experiments show that PartSAM outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by large margins across multiple benchmarks, marking a
decisive step toward foundation models for 3D part understanding. Our code and
model will be released soon.

Motivation: 解决遥感图像中指代表达理解在数据稀缺场景下泛化能力差的问题，因为监督微调方法需要大量标注数据，在少样本情况下表现不佳。

Method: 提出Geo-R1范式，采用推理中心强化微调方法，强制模型先生成明确的、可解释的推理链来分解指代表达，然后利用这些推理来定位目标对象，实现"先推理后行动"的过程。

Result: 在三个精心设计的少样本地理空间指代表达基准测试中，Geo-R1模型始终显著优于监督微调基线，并展现出强大的跨数据集泛化能力。

Conclusion: Geo-R1通过推理中心的强化微调方法，能够更有效地利用有限标注，增强泛化能力并提供可解释性，为少样本地理空间指代表达理解提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Referring expression understanding in remote sensing poses unique challenges,
as it requires reasoning over complex object-context relationships. While
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on multimodal large language models achieves
strong performance with massive labeled datasets, they struggle in data-scarce
scenarios, leading to poor generalization. To address this limitation, we
propose Geo-R1, a reasoning-centric reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) paradigm
for few-shot geospatial referring. Geo-R1 enforces the model to first generate
explicit, interpretable reasoning chains that decompose referring expressions,
and then leverage these rationales to localize target objects. This "reason
first, then act" process enables the model to make more effective use of
limited annotations, enhances generalization, and provides interpretability. We
validate Geo-R1 on three carefully designed few-shot geospatial referring
benchmarks, where our model consistently and substantially outperforms SFT
baselines. It also demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization,
highlighting its robustness. Code and data will be released at

TL;DR: 本研究评估了视觉语言模型在医疗视觉问答中的临床顺从性问题，提出了一个医学顺从性基准数据集，并开发了VIPER轻量级缓解策略来过滤非证据性内容，有效减少顺从行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在临床工作流程中应用日益广泛，但它们经常表现出顺从行为，优先考虑与用户措辞、社交线索或感知权威的一致性，而非基于证据的推理，这可能导致医疗决策风险。

Method: 从PathVQA、SLAKE和VQA-RAD构建医学顺从性数据集，按器官系统和模态分层；使用心理学动机的压力模板进行对抗实验；提出VIPER框架过滤非证据性内容并生成基于证据的答案。

Result: 实验发现各种VLM模型普遍易受攻击，表现出显著的对抗响应变化，与模型准确性或大小的相关性较弱；模仿和专家提供的修正被发现是最有效的触发因素。

Conclusion: VIPER框架平均减少了顺从行为，优于基线方法，同时保持可解释性；该基准分析和缓解框架为医疗VLM在真实世界临床交互中的稳健部署奠定了基础。

Abstract: Vision language models(VLMs) are increasingly integrated into clinical
workflows, but they often exhibit sycophantic behavior prioritizing alignment
with user phrasing social cues or perceived authority over evidence based
reasoning. This study evaluate clinical sycophancy in medical visual question
answering through a novel clinically grounded benchmark. We propose a medical
sycophancy dataset construct from PathVQA, SLAKE, and VQA-RAD stratified by
different type organ system and modality. Using psychologically motivated
pressure templates including various sycophancy. In our adversarial experiments
on various VLMs, we found that these models are generally vulnerable,
exhibiting significant variations in the occurrence of adversarial responses,
with weak correlations to the model accuracy or size. Imitation and expert
provided corrections were found to be the most effective triggers, suggesting
that the models possess a bias mechanism independent of visual evidence. To
address this, we propose Visual Information Purification for Evidence based
Response (VIPER) a lightweight mitigation strategy that filters non evidentiary
content for example social pressures and then generates constrained evidence
first answers. This framework reduces sycophancy by an average amount
outperforming baselines while maintaining interpretability. Our benchmark
analysis and mitigation framework lay the groundwork for robust deployment of
medical VLMs in real world clinician interactions emphasizing the need for
evidence anchored defenses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着智能眼镜的普及，用户注意力被整合到视觉语言模型中，但注视数据建模存在两个挑战：用户口头问题使用代词或省略上下文导致模糊性，以及人类注视模式嘈杂且与口头问题存在复杂时空关系。

Method: 首先分析数百个带有注视模态的查询样本，然后使用GPT-4o设计自动数据合成管道生成GLARIFY-Ambi数据集，包含专门的思维链过程处理嘈杂注视模式，最后设计热图模块将注视信息整合到先进视觉语言模型中。

Conclusion: 通过稳健地将视觉语言模型与人类注意力对齐，GLARIFY为视觉助手提供了一种可用且直观的交互范式。

Abstract: With the rise in popularity of smart glasses, users' attention has been
integrated into Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to streamline multi-modal
querying in daily scenarios. However, leveraging gaze data to model users'
attention may introduce ambiguity challenges: (1) users' verbal questions
become ambiguous by using pronouns or skipping context, (2) humans' gaze
patterns can be noisy and exhibit complex spatiotemporal relationships with
their spoken questions. Previous works only consider single image as visual
modality input, failing to capture the dynamic nature of the user's attention.
In this work, we introduce GLARIFY, a novel method to leverage spatiotemporal
gaze information to enhance the model's effectiveness in real-world
applications. Initially, we analyzed hundreds of querying samples with the gaze
modality to demonstrate the noisy nature of users' gaze patterns. We then
utilized GPT-4o to design an automatic data synthesis pipeline to generate the
GLARIFY-Ambi dataset, which includes a dedicated chain-of-thought (CoT) process
to handle noisy gaze patterns. Finally, we designed a heatmap module to
incorporate gaze information into cutting-edge VLMs while preserving their
pretrained knowledge. We evaluated GLARIFY using a hold-out test set.
Experiments demonstrate that GLARIFY significantly outperforms baselines. By
robustly aligning VLMs with human attention, GLARIFY paves the way for a usable
and intuitive interaction paradigm with a visual assistant.

Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型在处理高分辨率图像时产生大量计算开销，需要更高效的方法来减少视觉标记数量。

Method: 采用两阶段推理管道：首先分析降采样图像识别相关区域，然后仅对相关区域进行全分辨率处理；使用强化学习框架进行从粗到细的感知。

Conclusion: ERGO通过推理驱动的感知方法，在保持准确性的同时显著提高了视觉语言模型的效率。

Abstract: Efficient processing of high-resolution images is crucial for real-world
vision-language applications. However, existing Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) incur substantial computational overhead due to the large number of
vision tokens. With the advent of "thinking with images" models, reasoning now
extends beyond text to the visual domain. This capability motivates our
two-stage "coarse-to-fine" reasoning pipeline: first, a downsampled image is
analyzed to identify task-relevant regions; then, only these regions are
cropped at full resolution and processed in a subsequent reasoning stage. This
approach reduces computational cost while preserving fine-grained visual
details where necessary. A major challenge lies in inferring which regions are
truly relevant to a given query. Recent related methods often fail in the first
stage after input-image downsampling, due to perception-driven reasoning, where
clear visual information is required for effective reasoning. To address this
issue, we propose ERGO (Efficient Reasoning & Guided Observation) that performs
reasoning-driven perception-leveraging multimodal context to determine where to
focus. Our model can account for perceptual uncertainty, expanding the cropped
region to cover visually ambiguous areas for answering questions. To this end,
we develop simple yet effective reward components in a reinforcement learning
framework for coarse-to-fine perception. Across multiple datasets, our approach
delivers higher accuracy than the original model and competitive methods, with
greater efficiency. For instance, ERGO surpasses Qwen2.5-VL-7B on the V*
benchmark by 4.7 points while using only 23% of the vision tokens, achieving a
3x inference speedup. The code and models can be found at:

Method: 通过精心设计的探测数据集评估模型空间鲁棒性，发现视觉编码器能可靠感知不同位置的视觉内容，问题源于语言模型中位置嵌入的不平衡设计。提出平衡位置分配方法，为所有图像token分配相同的位置嵌入。

Result: 实验表明BaPA方法无需重新训练即可增强LVLMs的空间鲁棒性，结合轻量微调还能进一步提升其在多模态基准测试中的性能。信息流分析显示BaPA产生更平衡的注意力机制。

Conclusion: LVLMs存在显著的空间偏见问题，主要源于语言模型中位置嵌入的不平衡设计。提出的BaPA方法能有效解决这一问题，促进更平衡的视觉信息整合和更全面的视觉理解。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable success across
a wide range of multimodal tasks, yet their robustness to spatial variations
remains insufficiently understood. In this work, we present a systematic study
of the spatial bias of LVLMs, focusing on how models respond when identical key
visual information is placed at different locations within an image. Through a
carefully designed probing dataset, we demonstrate that current LVLMs often
produce inconsistent outputs under such spatial shifts, revealing a fundamental
limitation in their spatial-semantic understanding. Further analysis shows that
this phenomenon originates not from the vision encoder, which reliably
perceives and interprets visual content across positions, but from the
unbalanced design of position embeddings in the language model component. In
particular, the widely adopted position embedding strategies, such as RoPE,
introduce imbalance during cross-modal interaction, leading image tokens at
different positions to exert unequal influence on semantic understanding. To
mitigate this issue, we introduce Balanced Position Assignment (BaPA), a simple
yet effective mechanism that assigns identical position embeddings to all image
tokens, promoting a more balanced integration of visual information. Extensive
experiments show that BaPA enhances the spatial robustness of LVLMs without
retraining and further boosts their performance across diverse multimodal
benchmarks when combined with lightweight fine-tuning. Further analysis of
information flow reveals that BaPA yields balanced attention, enabling more
holistic visual understanding.

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for disentangling visual and semantic features
from the backbones of pre-trained diffusion models, enabling visual
correspondence in a manner analogous to the well-established semantic
correspondence. While diffusion model backbones are known to encode
semantically rich features, they must also contain visual features to support
their image synthesis capabilities. However, isolating these visual features is
challenging due to the absence of annotated datasets. To address this, we
introduce an automated pipeline that constructs image pairs with annotated
semantic and visual correspondences based on existing subject-driven image
generation datasets, and design a contrastive architecture to separate the two
feature types. Leveraging the disentangled representations, we propose a new
metric, Visual Semantic Matching (VSM), that quantifies visual inconsistencies
in subject-driven image generation. Empirical results show that our approach
outperforms global feature-based metrics such as CLIP, DINO, and
vision--language models in quantifying visual inconsistencies while also
enabling spatial localization of inconsistent regions. To our knowledge, this
is the first method that supports both quantification and localization of
inconsistencies in subject-driven generation, offering a valuable tool for
advancing this task. Project

Conclusion: WAVE通过联合训练策略验证了在所有模态上的性能提升，并引入了新的音频-视觉学习基准，为跨模态任意到任意应用开辟了广阔可能性。

Abstract: While embeddings from multimodal large language models (LLMs) excel as
general-purpose representations, their application to dynamic modalities like
audio and video remains underexplored. We introduce WAVE (\textbf{u}nified \&
\textbf{v}ersatile \textbf{a}udio-\textbf{v}isual \textbf{e}mbeddings), the
first LLM-based embedding that creates a unified representation space for text,
audio, and video modalities. WAVE employs a novel hierarchical feature fusion
strategy and a joint multi-modal, multi-task training approach to enable two
key capabilities: any-to-any cross-modal retrieval and the generation of
prompt-aware embeddings tailored to user instructions. Experimentally, WAVE
sets a new state-of-the-art on the MMEB-v2 video benchmark and achieves
superior results in audio and video-to-audio retrieval. Its prompt-aware nature
also yields remarkable performance in multimodal question answering,
significantly outperforming existing embedding models. Ablation studies
validate our joint training strategy, demonstrating improved performance across
all modalities. With a newly introduced benchmark for versatile audio-visual
learning, WAVE opens up broad possibilities for cross-modal, any-to-any
applications. Our code, checkpoints, and data will be released.

TL;DR: Refine-Control是一个半监督蒸馏框架，通过三层次知识融合损失和利用标记与未标记数据，在降低计算成本和延迟的同时保持高质量图像生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决条件图像生成模型在边缘设备部署时面临的高资源需求和标注数据稀缺问题，避免将用户数据发送给第三方带来的成本和隐私担忧。

Method: 提出半监督蒸馏框架，引入三层次知识融合损失来传递不同层次的知识，并利用标记和未标记数据进行训练以增强泛化能力。

Result: 实验表明Refine-Control显著降低了计算成本和延迟，同时保持了高保真度的生成能力和可控性。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了边缘设备部署条件图像生成模型的挑战，在资源效率和性能之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Conditional image generation models have achieved remarkable results by
leveraging text-based control to generate customized images. However, the high
resource demands of these models and the scarcity of well-annotated data have
hindered their deployment on edge devices, leading to enormous costs and
privacy concerns, especially when user data is sent to a third party. To
overcome these challenges, we propose Refine-Control, a semi-supervised
distillation framework. Specifically, we improve the performance of the student
model by introducing a tri-level knowledge fusion loss to transfer different
levels of knowledge. To enhance generalization and alleviate dataset scarcity,
we introduce a semi-supervised distillation method utilizing both labeled and
unlabeled data. Our experiments reveal that Refine-Control achieves significant
reductions in computational cost and latency, while maintaining high-fidelity
generation capabilities and controllability, as quantified by comparative
metrics.

### [95] [DualFocus: Depth from Focus with Spatio-Focal Dual Variational Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21992)
*Sungmin Woo,Sangyoun Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DualFocus是一个新颖的深度聚焦框架，通过联合建模空间和焦距维度上的焦点变化，利用焦点堆栈中由焦点变化引起的独特梯度模式，提高复杂场景中深度估计的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于学习的深度聚焦方法在复杂场景中表现不佳，特别是在具有精细纹理或突然深度变化的区域，焦点线索可能变得模糊或误导。

Method: 提出变分公式，包含针对深度聚焦的双重约束：空间约束利用不同焦点级别的梯度模式变化来区分真实深度边缘和纹理伪影；焦距约束强制单峰、单调的焦点概率，与物理焦点行为保持一致。

Result: 在四个公共数据集上的综合实验表明，DualFocus在深度准确性和感知质量方面始终优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: DualFocus通过引入空间和焦距约束的归纳偏置，显著提高了深度聚焦在挑战性区域的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Depth-from-Focus (DFF) enables precise depth estimation by analyzing focus
cues across a stack of images captured at varying focal lengths. While recent
learning-based approaches have advanced this field, they often struggle in
complex scenes with fine textures or abrupt depth changes, where focus cues may
become ambiguous or misleading. We present DualFocus, a novel DFF framework
that leverages the focal stack's unique gradient patterns induced by focus
variation, jointly modeling focus changes over spatial and focal dimensions.
Our approach introduces a variational formulation with dual constraints
tailored to DFF: spatial constraints exploit gradient pattern changes across
focus levels to distinguish true depth edges from texture artifacts, while
focal constraints enforce unimodal, monotonic focus probabilities aligned with
physical focus behavior. These inductive biases improve robustness and accuracy
in challenging regions. Comprehensive experiments on four public datasets
demonstrate that DualFocus consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
both depth accuracy and perceptual quality.

TL;DR: 提出了RDcomm框架，基于信息论的多智能体协作感知方法，通过任务熵离散编码和互信息驱动的消息选择，在3D目标检测和BEV分割任务上实现SOTA精度，同时将通信量减少高达108倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有协作感知研究缺乏理论基础，特别是在任务性能与通信量之间的权衡方面存在理论空白，需要建立信息论基础来分析多智能体系统的性能-通信权衡。

Method: 提出了RDcomm框架，包含两个关键创新：1）任务熵离散编码，为特征分配任务相关的码字长度以最大化实用信息效率；2）互信息驱动的消息选择，利用互信息神经估计接近最优无冗余条件。

Result: 在DAIR-V2X和OPV2V数据集上的实验表明，RDcomm在3D目标检测和BEV分割任务上达到了最先进的精度，同时通信量减少了高达108倍。

Conclusion: 基于信息论的率失真理论为多智能体协作感知提供了理论基础，RDcomm框架通过优化信息传输效率实现了性能与通信量的最佳平衡。

Abstract: Collaborative perception emphasizes enhancing environmental understanding by
enabling multiple agents to share visual information with limited bandwidth
resources. While prior work has explored the empirical trade-off between task
performance and communication volume, a significant gap remains in the
theoretical foundation. To fill this gap, we draw on information theory and
introduce a pragmatic rate-distortion theory for multi-agent collaboration,
specifically formulated to analyze performance-communication trade-off in
goal-oriented multi-agent systems. This theory concretizes two key conditions
for designing optimal communication strategies: supplying pragmatically
relevant information and transmitting redundancy-less messages. Guided by these
two conditions, we propose RDcomm, a communication-efficient collaborative
perception framework that introduces two key innovations: i) task entropy
discrete coding, which assigns features with task-relevant codeword-lengths to
maximize the efficiency in supplying pragmatic information; ii)
mutual-information-driven message selection, which utilizes mutual information
neural estimation to approach the optimal redundancy-less condition.
Experiments on 3D object detection and BEV segmentation demonstrate that RDcomm
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on DAIR-V2X and OPV2V, while reducing
communication volume by up to 108 times. The code will be released.

TL;DR: FailureAtlas是一个主动探索文本到图像模型失败场景的框架，通过结构化搜索方法发现了大量未知错误，并揭示了这些失败与训练数据稀缺的关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态基准测试在诊断文本到图像模型的系统性失败方面能力有限，需要一种主动探索的方法来全面发现和定位失败的根本原因。

Method: 将错误发现构建为对最小化失败诱导概念的结构化搜索问题，并采用新颖的加速技术使计算可行。

Result: 在Stable Diffusion模型上发现了超过247,000个先前未知的错误片段，并首次提供了大规模证据表明这些失败与训练数据稀缺相关。

Conclusion: FailureAtlas建立了一种新的诊断优先方法学，为开发更稳健的生成式AI提供了原则性和可扩展的深度模型审计引擎。

Abstract: Static benchmarks have provided a valuable foundation for comparing
Text-to-Image (T2I) models. However, their passive design offers limited
diagnostic power, struggling to uncover the full landscape of systematic
failures or isolate their root causes. We argue for a complementary paradigm:
active exploration. We introduce FailureAtlas, the first framework designed to
autonomously explore and map the vast failure landscape of T2I models at scale.
FailureAtlas frames error discovery as a structured search for minimal,
failure-inducing concepts. While it is a computationally explosive problem, we
make it tractable with novel acceleration techniques. When applied to Stable
Diffusion models, our method uncovers hundreds of thousands of previously
unknown error slices (over 247,000 in SD1.5 alone) and provides the first
large-scale evidence linking these failures to data scarcity in the training
set. By providing a principled and scalable engine for deep model auditing,
FailureAtlas establishes a new, diagnostic-first methodology to guide the
development of more robust generative AI. The code is available at

*Jiayu Ding,Xinpeng Liu,Zhiyi Pan,Shiqiang Long,Ge Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MUSplat是一个无需训练的框架，将2D开放词汇理解提升到3D高斯泼溅场景，解决了现有方法依赖逐场景训练、单语义限制和跨视图语义不一致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主流方法存在三个关键缺陷：依赖昂贵的逐场景重新训练、限制性的单语义设计无法表示复杂多概念语义、跨视图语义不一致性破坏最终语义表示。

Method: 利用预训练的2D分割模型生成多粒度2D掩码并提升到3D，估计每个高斯点的前景概率形成初始对象组，使用语义熵和几何不透明度优化模糊边界，通过VLM从最具代表性视角解释对象外观并提取稳健文本特征。

Result: MUSplat将场景适应时间从数小时减少到几分钟，在开放词汇3D对象选择和语义分割基准任务中优于已建立的基于训练的框架。

Conclusion: 通过消除昂贵的逐场景训练过程，MUSplat在解决单语义限制的同时实现了更好的性能，为3D开放词汇理解提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Lifting 2D open-vocabulary understanding into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
scenes is a critical challenge. However, mainstream methods suffer from three
key flaws: (i) their reliance on costly per-scene retraining prevents
plug-and-play application; (ii) their restrictive monosemous design fails to
represent complex, multi-concept semantics; and (iii) their vulnerability to
cross-view semantic inconsistencies corrupts the final semantic representation.
To overcome these limitations, we introduce MUSplat, a training-free framework
that abandons feature optimization entirely. Leveraging a pre-trained 2D
segmentation model, our pipeline generates and lifts multi-granularity 2D masks
into 3D, where we estimate a foreground probability for each Gaussian point to
form initial object groups. We then optimize the ambiguous boundaries of these
initial groups using semantic entropy and geometric opacity. Subsequently, by
interpreting the object's appearance across its most representative viewpoints,
a Vision-Language Model (VLM) distills robust textual features that reconciles
visual inconsistencies, enabling open-vocabulary querying via semantic
matching. By eliminating the costly per-scene training process, MUSplat reduces
scene adaptation time from hours to mere minutes. On benchmark tasks for
open-vocabulary 3D object selection and semantic segmentation, MUSplat
outperforms established training-based frameworks while simultaneously
addressing their monosemous limitations.

*Youxu Shi,Suorong Yang,Dong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的自监督幻觉缓解方法，通过文本到图像模型将描述投影到视觉空间来放大幻觉信号，使用正负锚点编辑解码器隐藏状态，显著减少多模态大语言模型的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务中表现出色，但容易产生与视觉证据不一致的幻觉内容，现有方法通常需要额外微调或牺牲信息量和可扩展性。

Method: 引入幻觉放大机制：通过文本到图像模型将描述投影到视觉空间作为负锚点，原始图像作为正锚点，编辑解码器隐藏状态，将表示拉向忠实语义方向并推离幻觉方向。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著减少了对象、属性和关系层面的幻觉，使用LLaVA-v1.5-7B在CHAIR上实现超过5%的幻觉减少，同时保持召回率和描述丰富性，并在多种架构上验证了强跨架构泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法无需人工先验或额外训练成本，对无幻觉描述几乎没有副作用，具有鲁棒性和即插即用的实用性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success
across diverse vision-language tasks, yet they remain highly susceptible to
hallucinations, producing content that is fluent but inconsistent with visual
evidence. Such hallucinations, spanning objects, attributes, and relations,
persist even in larger models, while existing mitigation approaches often
require additional finetuning, handcrafted priors, or trade-offs that
compromise informativeness and scalability. To address this limitation, we
propose a training-free, self-supervised method for hallucination mitigation.
Our approach introduces a novel hallucination amplification mechanism: a
caption is projected into the visual space via a text-to-image model to reveal
implicit hallucination signals, serving as a negative anchor, while the
original image provides a positive anchor. Leveraging these dual anchors, we
edit decoder hidden states by pulling representations toward faithful semantics
and pushing them away from hallucination directions. This correction requires
no human priors or additional training costs, ensuring both effectiveness and
efficiency. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that our
method significantly reduces hallucinations at the object, attribute, and
relation levels while largely preserving recall and caption richness, e.g.,
achieving a hallucination reduction by over 5% using LLaVA-v1.5-7B on CHAIR.
Furthermore, results on diverse architectures, including LLaVA-NEXT-7B,
Cambrian-8B, and InstructBLIP-7B, validate strong cross-architecture
generalization. More importantly, when applied to hallucination-free captions,
our method introduces almost no side effects, underscoring its robustness and
practical plug-and-play applicability. The implementation will be publicly
available.

TL;DR: 提出了Neural-MedBench基准测试，专门用于评估神经学领域多模态临床推理能力，发现现有视觉语言模型在推理密集型任务上表现显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学基准测试过于强调分类准确性，导致模型看似熟练但实际缺乏高风险的诊断推理能力，需要更深入的评估方法。

Method: 开发了包含多序列MRI扫描、结构化电子健康记录和临床笔记的紧凑基准测试，涵盖鉴别诊断、病变识别和理由生成三个核心任务家族，并使用混合评分管道进行评估。

Result: 对GPT-4o、Claude-4和MedGemma等先进VLM进行系统评估，发现相比传统数据集性能显著下降，错误分析显示推理失败而非感知错误是主要问题。

Conclusion: 提出了双轴评估框架：广度导向的大数据集用于统计泛化，深度导向的紧凑基准测试用于推理保真度，Neural-MedBench可作为开放可扩展的诊断测试平台。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable
performance on standard medical benchmarks, yet their true clinical reasoning
ability remains unclear. Existing datasets predominantly emphasize
classification accuracy, creating an evaluation illusion in which models appear
proficient while still failing at high-stakes diagnostic reasoning. We
introduce Neural-MedBench, a compact yet reasoning-intensive benchmark
specifically designed to probe the limits of multimodal clinical reasoning in
neurology. Neural-MedBench integrates multi-sequence MRI scans, structured
electronic health records, and clinical notes, and encompasses three core task
families: differential diagnosis, lesion recognition, and rationale generation.
To ensure reliable evaluation, we develop a hybrid scoring pipeline that
combines LLM-based graders, clinician validation, and semantic similarity
metrics. Through systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art VLMs, including
GPT-4o, Claude-4, and MedGemma, we observe a sharp performance drop compared to
conventional datasets. Error analysis shows that reasoning failures, rather
than perceptual errors, dominate model shortcomings. Our findings highlight the
necessity of a Two-Axis Evaluation Framework: breadth-oriented large datasets
for statistical generalization, and depth-oriented, compact benchmarks such as
Neural-MedBench for reasoning fidelity. We release Neural-MedBench at
https://neuromedbench.github.io/ as an open and extensible diagnostic testbed,
which guides the expansion of future benchmarks and enables rigorous yet
cost-effective assessment of clinically trustworthy AI.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoFFT是一种无需训练的方法，通过模拟人类视觉认知来增强视觉语言模型的视觉推理能力，包含多样化样本生成、双重前瞻解码和视觉焦点调整三个迭代阶段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在处理包含大量无关信息的图像时容易受到干扰，产生任务无关的推理过程甚至幻觉，因为它们无法在推理过程中精确发现和处理所需区域。

Method: CoFFT包含三个迭代阶段：1) 多样化样本生成：生成多样化推理样本来探索潜在推理路径；2) 双重前瞻解码：基于视觉焦点和推理进展严格评估样本；3) 视觉焦点调整：精确调整视觉焦点到对未来推理最有益的区域。

Result: 在多个基准测试中使用Qwen2.5-VL、InternVL-2.5和Llava-Next模型，CoFFT实现了3.1-5.8%的持续性能提升，且计算开销可控增加。

Conclusion: CoFFT通过模拟人类视觉认知的迭代过程，有效提升了视觉语言模型的视觉推理能力，解决了复杂冗余视觉输入带来的干扰问题。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Vision Language Models (VLMs), they remain
constrained by the complexity and redundancy of visual input. When images
contain large amounts of irrelevant information, VLMs are susceptible to
interference, thus generating excessive task-irrelevant reasoning processes or
even hallucinations. This limitation stems from their inability to discover and
process the required regions during reasoning precisely. To address this
limitation, we present the Chain of Foresight-Focus Thought (CoFFT), a novel
training-free approach that enhances VLMs' visual reasoning by emulating human
visual cognition. Each Foresight-Focus Thought consists of three stages: (1)
Diverse Sample Generation: generates diverse reasoning samples to explore
potential reasoning paths, where each sample contains several reasoning steps;
(2) Dual Foresight Decoding: rigorously evaluates these samples based on both
visual focus and reasoning progression, adding the first step of optimal sample
to the reasoning process; (3) Visual Focus Adjustment: precisely adjust visual
focus toward regions most beneficial for future reasoning, before returning to
stage (1) to generate subsequent reasoning samples until reaching the final
answer. These stages function iteratively, creating an interdependent cycle
where reasoning guides visual focus and visual focus informs subsequent
reasoning. Empirical results across multiple benchmarks using Qwen2.5-VL,
InternVL-2.5, and Llava-Next demonstrate consistent performance improvements of
3.1-5.8\% with controllable increasing computational overhead.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SceneSplit是一种针对文本到视频(T2V)模型的黑盒越狱攻击方法，通过将有害叙述分解为多个看似良性的场景，利用场景组合约束生成空间，成功绕过安全机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着T2V模型的快速发展，其安全风险日益凸显。虽然已有研究探索了LLMs、VLMs和T2I模型的漏洞，但T2V模型的安全性尚未得到充分研究，存在显著的安全空白。

Method: 提出SceneSplit方法：1）将有害叙述分解为多个单独良性的场景；2）利用场景组合约束生成空间；3）通过迭代场景操作绕过安全过滤器；4）使用策略库重用成功攻击模式。

Result: 在11个安全类别上评估，SceneSplit在Luma Ray2上达到77.2%的平均攻击成功率，在Hailuo上达到84.1%，在Veo2上达到78.2%，显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 当前T2V安全机制容易受到利用叙事结构攻击的影响，这项工作为理解和改进T2V模型安全性提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Along with the rapid advancement of numerous Text-to-Video (T2V) models,
growing concerns have emerged regarding their safety risks. While recent
studies have explored vulnerabilities in models like LLMs, VLMs, and
Text-to-Image (T2I) models through jailbreak attacks, T2V models remain largely
unexplored, leaving a significant safety gap. To address this gap, we introduce
SceneSplit, a novel black-box jailbreak method that works by fragmenting a
harmful narrative into multiple scenes, each individually benign. This approach
manipulates the generative output space, the abstract set of all potential
video outputs for a given prompt, using the combination of scenes as a powerful
constraint to guide the final outcome. While each scene individually
corresponds to a wide and safe space where most outcomes are benign, their
sequential combination collectively restricts this space, narrowing it to an
unsafe region and significantly increasing the likelihood of generating a
harmful video. This core mechanism is further enhanced through iterative scene
manipulation, which bypasses the safety filter within this constrained unsafe
region. Additionally, a strategy library that reuses successful attack patterns
further improves the attack's overall effectiveness and robustness. To validate
our method, we evaluate SceneSplit across 11 safety categories on T2V models.
Our results show that it achieves a high average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of
77.2% on Luma Ray2, 84.1% on Hailuo, and 78.2% on Veo2, significantly
outperforming the existing baseline. Through this work, we demonstrate that
current T2V safety mechanisms are vulnerable to attacks that exploit narrative
structure, providing new insights for understanding and improving the safety of
T2V models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面对面教学场景在计算机视觉领域缺乏系统性研究，主要原因是缺乏合适的数据集和有限的分析技术，需要开发能够整合处理语言和非语言交流的方法。

Method: 构建了包含语音内容、韵律、注视、身体动作和视觉上下文的多模态面对面教学数据集，并基准测试了能够联合处理图像、音频和文本的多模态大语言模型与传统任务特定模型。

Result: 多模态大语言模型在没有任务特定微调的情况下就超越了专用基线模型，显示出其在理解教学互动方面的潜力。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型有望实现对教学互动的整体理解，为教育支持和技能传递提供新的分析工具。

Abstract: Analyzing instructional interactions between an instructor and a learner who
are co-present in the same physical space is a critical problem for educational
support and skill transfer. Yet such face-to-face instructional scenes have not
been systematically studied in computer vision. We identify two key reasons: i)
the lack of suitable datasets and ii) limited analytical techniques. To address
this gap, we present a new egocentric video dataset of face-to-face instruction
and provide ground-truth annotations for two fundamental tasks that serve as a
first step toward a comprehensive understanding of instructional interactions:
procedural step segmentation and conversation-state classification. Using this
dataset, we benchmark multimodal large language models (MLLMs) against
conventional task-specific models. Since face-to-face instruction involves
multiple modalities (speech content and prosody, gaze and body motion, and
visual context), effective understanding requires methods that handle verbal
and nonverbal communication in an integrated manner. Accordingly, we evaluate
recently introduced MLLMs that jointly process images, audio, and text. This
evaluation quantifies the extent to which current machine learning models
understand face-to-face instructional scenes. In experiments, MLLMs outperform
specialized baselines even without task-specific fine-tuning, suggesting their
promise for holistic understanding of instructional interactions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于动量的采样技术HiGS，通过整合历史预测信息来提升扩散模型的图像生成质量，无需额外计算或训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成方面取得了显著进展，但在使用较少神经网络评估次数或较低引导尺度时，输出仍可能显得不真实且缺乏细节。

Method: HiGS利用当前预测与过去预测加权平均之间的差异来引导采样过程，从而产生更真实、细节更丰富的输出。

Result: 实验表明HiGS在不同模型和架构下都能持续提升图像质量，使用预训练的SiT模型在ImageNet 256×256无引导生成中仅用30步就达到了1.61的FID新纪录。

Conclusion: HiGS是一个即插即用的扩散采样增强方法，能够实现更快生成和更高保真度。

Abstract: While diffusion models have made remarkable progress in image generation,
their outputs can still appear unrealistic and lack fine details, especially
when using fewer number of neural function evaluations (NFEs) or lower guidance
scales. To address this issue, we propose a novel momentum-based sampling
technique, termed history-guided sampling (HiGS), which enhances quality and
efficiency of diffusion sampling by integrating recent model predictions into
each inference step. Specifically, HiGS leverages the difference between the
current prediction and a weighted average of past predictions to steer the
sampling process toward more realistic outputs with better details and
structure. Our approach introduces practically no additional computation and
integrates seamlessly into existing diffusion frameworks, requiring neither
extra training nor fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that HiGS
consistently improves image quality across diverse models and architectures and
under varying sampling budgets and guidance scales. Moreover, using a
pretrained SiT model, HiGS achieves a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.61 for
unguided ImageNet generation at 256$\times$256 with only 30 sampling steps
(instead of the standard 250). We thus present HiGS as a plug-and-play
enhancement to standard diffusion sampling that enables faster generation with
higher fidelity.

TL;DR: DAVIS是一个基于扩散模型的音频-视觉分离框架，通过生成式学习解决音频-视觉声源分离任务，超越了传统基于掩码的回归方法，能够生成更高质量的分离声音。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将声音分离视为基于掩码的回归问题，但在捕捉复杂数据分布以高质量分离不同类别声音方面存在局限。

Method: 利用去噪扩散概率模型(DDPM)和流匹配(FM)等生成建模范式，在专门的分离U-Net架构中，通过从噪声分布合成所需分离的声音频谱图，同时以混合音频输入和相关视觉信息为条件。

Result: 在标准AVE和MUSIC数据集上的评估显示，DAVIS的两个变体在分离质量上都超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: 生成式框架在解决音频-视觉声源分离任务方面具有显著效果，DAVIS展示了生成建模在这一领域的优势。

Abstract: We propose DAVIS, a Diffusion-based Audio-VIsual Separation framework that
solves the audio-visual sound source separation task through generative
learning. Existing methods typically frame sound separation as a mask-based
regression problem, achieving significant progress. However, they face
limitations in capturing the complex data distribution required for
high-quality separation of sounds from diverse categories. In contrast, DAVIS
circumvents these issues by leveraging potent generative modeling paradigms,
specifically Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) and the more
recent Flow Matching (FM), integrated within a specialized Separation U-Net
architecture. Our framework operates by synthesizing the desired separated
sound spectrograms directly from a noise distribution, conditioned concurrently
on the mixed audio input and associated visual information. The inherent nature
of its generative objective makes DAVIS particularly adept at producing
high-quality sound separations for diverse sound categories. We present
comparative evaluations of DAVIS, encompassing both its DDPM and Flow Matching
variants, against leading methods on the standard AVE and MUSIC datasets. The
results affirm that both variants surpass existing approaches in separation
quality, highlighting the efficacy of our generative framework for tackling the
audio-visual source separation task.

Abstract: Current Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) algorithms typically focus on
mapping visual features to semantic labels or attempt to enhance learning by
fusing visual and attribute information. However, these methods fail to fully
exploit attribute knowledge and contextual information for more accurate
recognition. Although recent works have started to consider using attribute
text as additional input to enhance the association between visual and semantic
information, these methods are still in their infancy. To address the above
challenges, this paper proposes the construction of a multi-modal knowledge
graph, which is utilized to mine the relationships between local visual
features and text, as well as the relationships between attributes and
extensive visual context samples. Specifically, we propose an effective
multi-modal knowledge graph construction method that fully considers the
relationships among attributes and the relationships between attributes and
vision tokens. To effectively model these relationships, this paper introduces
a knowledge graph-guided cross-modal hypergraph learning framework to enhance
the standard pedestrian attribute recognition framework. Comprehensive
experiments on multiple PAR benchmark datasets have thoroughly demonstrated the
effectiveness of our proposed knowledge graph for the PAR task, establishing a
strong foundation for knowledge-guided pedestrian attribute recognition. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GAN和扩散模型生成的伪造内容越来越逼真，现有方法仅关注空间或频域特征，泛化能力有限

Method: 基于改进XceptionNet，提出双域特征耦合器(DDFC)分解特征到局部空间分支和全局频谱分支，以及双傅里叶注意力(DFA)模块动态融合空间和频谱特征

Result: 在多个深度伪造基准测试中达到最先进准确率，特别是在跨数据集和未知篡改场景下表现优异，同时保持实时性

Conclusion: 统一的空间-频谱学习对于鲁棒和可泛化的深度伪造检测具有有效性

Abstract: The increasing realism of content generated by GANs and diffusion models has
made deepfake detection significantly more challenging. Existing approaches
often focus solely on spatial or frequency-domain features, limiting their
generalization to unseen manipulations. We propose the Spectral
Cross-Attentional Network (SpecXNet), a dual-domain architecture for robust
deepfake detection. The core \textbf{Dual-Domain Feature Coupler (DDFC)}
decomposes features into a local spatial branch for capturing texture-level
anomalies and a global spectral branch that employs Fast Fourier Transform to
model periodic inconsistencies. This dual-domain formulation allows SpecXNet to
jointly exploit localized detail and global structural coherence, which are
critical for distinguishing authentic from manipulated images. We also
introduce the \textbf{Dual Fourier Attention (DFA)} module, which dynamically
fuses spatial and spectral features in a content-aware manner. Built atop a
modified XceptionNet backbone, we embed the DDFC and DFA modules within a
separable convolution block. Extensive experiments on multiple deepfake
benchmarks show that SpecXNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, particularly
under cross-dataset and unseen manipulation scenarios, while maintaining
real-time feasibility. Our results highlight the effectiveness of unified
spatial-spectral learning for robust and generalizable deepfake detection. To
ensure reproducibility, we released the full code on

Motivation: 医学图像解剖理解对于自动报告生成、术中导航和器官定位至关重要，但专家标注数据稀缺限制了发展。利用标注参考图像指导未标注目标图像的解释是一个有前景的解决方案。

Method: 首先训练视觉语言模型通过参考图像和目标图像之间的相对空间推理来识别解剖区域，然后将其空间线索与SAM2的细粒度分割能力相结合，实现小解剖区域的定位和像素级分割。

Result: 在两个分布内和两个分布外数据集上，RAU始终优于使用相同内存设置的SAM2微调基线，产生更准确的分割和更可靠的定位，并展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: RAU是首个探索视觉语言模型在医学图像中基于参考的解剖结构识别、定位和分割能力的工作，其优异性能突显了VLM驱动方法在自动化临床工作流程中解剖理解的潜力。

Abstract: Anatomical understanding through deep learning is critical for automatic
report generation, intra-operative navigation, and organ localization in
medical imaging; however, its progress is constrained by the scarcity of
expert-labeled data. A promising remedy is to leverage an annotated reference
image to guide the interpretation of an unlabeled target. Although recent
vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit non-trivial visual reasoning, their
reference-based understanding and fine-grained localization remain limited. We
introduce RAU, a framework for reference-based anatomical understanding with
VLMs. We first show that a VLM learns to identify anatomical regions through
relative spatial reasoning between reference and target images, trained on a
moderately sized dataset. We validate this capability through visual question
answering (VQA) and bounding box prediction. Next, we demonstrate that the
VLM-derived spatial cues can be seamlessly integrated with the fine-grained
segmentation capability of SAM2, enabling localization and pixel-level
segmentation of small anatomical regions, such as vessel segments. Across two
in-distribution and two out-of-distribution datasets, RAU consistently
outperforms a SAM2 fine-tuning baseline using the same memory setup, yielding
more accurate segmentations and more reliable localization. More importantly,
its strong generalization ability makes it scalable to out-of-distribution
datasets, a property crucial for medical image applications. To the best of our
knowledge, RAU is the first to explore the capability of VLMs for
reference-based identification, localization, and segmentation of anatomical
structures in medical images. Its promising performance highlights the
potential of VLM-driven approaches for anatomical understanding in automated
clinical workflows.

TL;DR: 提出了Large Material Gaussian Model (MGM)，一个能够生成带有PBR材质（反照率、粗糙度、金属度）的高质量3D内容的新框架，解决了现有模型无法生成材质属性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大规模重建模型虽然能高效实现高质量3D渲染，但无法生成资产的材质属性，这在多样化光照环境下对真实感渲染至关重要。

Method: 首先微调一个新的基于深度和法线图的多视角材质扩散模型，然后利用生成的多视角PBR图像探索高斯材质表示，该表示与2D高斯溅射对齐并建模PBR材质的每个通道。

Result: 广泛实验表明，该方法产生的材质不仅比基线方法更具视觉吸引力，还增强了材质建模能力，实现了实用的下游渲染应用。

Conclusion: MGM框架成功生成了带有PBR材质的高质量3D内容，支持动态重光照，为3D内容创建提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing demand for 3D assets across various industries necessitates
efficient and automated methods for 3D content creation. Leveraging 3D Gaussian
Splatting, recent large reconstruction models (LRMs) have demonstrated the
ability to efficiently achieve high-quality 3D rendering by integrating
multiview diffusion for generation and scalable transformers for
reconstruction. However, existing models fail to produce the material
properties of assets, which is crucial for realistic rendering in diverse
lighting environments. In this paper, we introduce the Large Material Gaussian
Model (MGM), a novel framework designed to generate high-quality 3D content
with Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials, ie, albedo, roughness, and
metallic properties, rather than merely producing RGB textures with
uncontrolled light baking. Specifically, we first fine-tune a new multiview
material diffusion model conditioned on input depth and normal maps. Utilizing
the generated multiview PBR images, we explore a Gaussian material
representation that not only aligns with 2D Gaussian Splatting but also models
each channel of the PBR materials. The reconstructed point clouds can then be
rendered to acquire PBR attributes, enabling dynamic relighting by applying
various ambient light maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
materials produced by our method not only exhibit greater visual appeal
compared to baseline methods but also enhance material modeling, thereby
enabling practical downstream rendering applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种增强多模态大语言模型可解释性的方法，通过视觉分支的多尺度解释聚合和文本分支的激活排序相关性，解决了现有方法忽略模态内依赖关系的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可解释性研究主要关注跨模态归因，但忽视了模态内依赖关系。视觉模态中孤立图像块的归因忽略了空间上下文，文本模态中依赖前序标记引入了虚假激活，这些干扰降低了归因的保真度。

Method: 视觉分支采用多尺度解释聚合，通过多尺度输入聚合归因来动态调整感受野；文本分支采用激活排序相关性，通过top-k预测排名的对齐来测量上下文标记的相关性，抑制无关上下文的虚假激活。

Result: 在先进MLLMs和基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法始终优于现有可解释性方法，产生更忠实和细粒度的模型行为解释。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过有效利用模态内交互，显著提升了多模态大语言模型的可解释性，为理解模型内部决策机制提供了更可靠的途径。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success
across diverse vision-language tasks, yet their internal decision-making
mechanisms remain insufficiently understood. Existing interpretability research
has primarily focused on cross-modal attribution, identifying which image
regions the model attends to during output generation. However, these
approaches often overlook intra-modal dependencies. In the visual modality,
attributing importance to isolated image patches ignores spatial context due to
limited receptive fields, resulting in fragmented and noisy explanations. In
the textual modality, reliance on preceding tokens introduces spurious
activations. Failing to effectively mitigate these interference compromises
attribution fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose enhancing
interpretability by leveraging intra-modal interaction. For the visual branch,
we introduce \textit{Multi-Scale Explanation Aggregation} (MSEA), which
aggregates attributions over multi-scale inputs to dynamically adjust receptive
fields, producing more holistic and spatially coherent visual explanations. For
the textual branch, we propose \textit{Activation Ranking Correlation} (ARC),
which measures the relevance of contextual tokens to the current token via
alignment of their top-$k$ prediction rankings. ARC leverages this relevance to
suppress spurious activations from irrelevant contexts while preserving
semantically coherent ones. Extensive experiments across state-of-the-art MLLMs
and benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
existing interpretability methods, yielding more faithful and fine-grained
explanations of model behavior.

Abstract: Point cloud completion aims to reconstruct complete shapes from partial
observations. Although current methods have achieved remarkable performance,
they still have some limitations: Supervised methods heavily rely on ground
truth, which limits their generalization to real-world datasets due to the
synthetic-to-real domain gap. Unsupervised methods require complete point
clouds to compose unpaired training data, and weakly-supervised methods need
multi-view observations of the object. Existing self-supervised methods
frequently produce unsatisfactory predictions due to the limited capabilities
of their self-supervised signals. To overcome these challenges, we propose a
novel self-supervised point cloud completion method. We design a set of novel
self-supervised signals based on multi-view augmentations of the single partial
point cloud. Additionally, to enhance the model's learning ability, we first
incorporate Mamba into self-supervised point cloud completion task, encouraging
the model to generate point clouds with better quality. Experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Material node graphs are programs that generate the 2D channels of procedural
materials, including geometry such as roughness and displacement maps, and
reflectance such as albedo and conductivity maps. They are essential in
computer graphics for representing the appearance of virtual 3D objects
parametrically and at arbitrary resolution. In particular, their directed
acyclic graph structures and intermediate states provide an intuitive
understanding and workflow for interactive appearance modeling. Creating such
graphs is a challenging task and typically requires professional training.
While recent neural program synthesis approaches attempt to simplify this
process, they solely represent graphs as textual programs, failing to capture
the inherently visual-spatial nature of node graphs that makes them accessible
to humans. To address this gap, we present MultiMat, a multimodal program
synthesis framework that leverages large multimodal models to process both
visual and textual graph representations for improved generation of procedural
material graphs. We train our models on a new dataset of production-quality
procedural materials and combine them with a constrained tree search inference
algorithm that ensures syntactic validity while efficiently navigating the
program space. Our experimental results show that our multimodal program
synthesis method is more efficient in both unconditional and conditional graph
synthesis with higher visual quality and fidelity than text-only baselines,
establishing new state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 该论文探索使用2D高斯泼溅(2DGS)作为视觉语言模型的替代视觉表示，相比传统RGB图像，2DGS能实现3-20倍的输入压缩，同时保持有意义的零样本性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统RGB视觉编码器在边缘设备到云端传输时的两大结构低效问题：(i)密集RGB图像传输能耗高、成本大；(ii)基于patch的tokenization导致序列长度爆炸，增加注意力计算负担。

Method: 开发可扩展的2DGS流水线，包括结构化初始化、亮度感知剪枝和批量CUDA内核；通过轻量级splat感知输入主干和感知器重采样器，将对比语言图像预训练(CLIP)适配到2DGS表示，仅训练约7%的总参数。

Result: 在大型DataComp子集上，GS编码器在实现3-20倍输入压缩的同时，仍能获得有意义的零样本ImageNet-1K性能；虽然准确率目前低于RGB编码器，但实现了超过90倍的拟合加速和约97%的GPU利用率。

Conclusion: 2DGS被确立为可行的多模态基板，指出了架构瓶颈，并为开发既语义强大又传输高效的边缘-云端学习表示开辟了道路。

Abstract: Modern vision language pipelines are driven by RGB vision encoders trained on
massive image text corpora. While these pipelines have enabled impressive zero
shot capabilities and strong transfer across tasks, they still inherit two
structural inefficiencies from the pixel domain: (i) transmitting dense RGB
images from edge devices to the cloud is energy intensive and costly, and (ii)
patch based tokenization explodes sequence length, stressing attention budgets
and context limits. We explore 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) as an alternative
visual substrate for alignment: a compact, spatially adaptive representation
that parameterizes images by a set of colored anisotropic Gaussians. We develop
a scalable 2DGS pipeline with structured initialization, luminance aware
pruning, and batched CUDA kernels, achieving over 90x faster fitting and about
97% GPU utilization compared to prior implementations. We further adapt
contrastive language image pretraining (CLIP) to 2DGS by reusing a frozen
RGB-based transformer backbone with a lightweight splat aware input stem and a
perceiver resampler, training only about 7% of the total parameters. On large
DataComp subsets, GS encoders yield meaningful zero shot ImageNet-1K
performance while compressing inputs 3 to 20x relative to pixels. While
accuracy currently trails RGB encoders, our results establish 2DGS as a viable
multimodal substrate, pinpoint architectural bottlenecks, and open a path
toward representations that are both semantically powerful and transmission
efficient for edge cloud learning.

Method: 结合StyleGAN的结构化潜在空间、DragGAN的直观图像操作和PCA的降维能力，在AFHQ数据集上进行实验，将PCA引入DragGAN的W+潜在层。

Result: 在浅层潜在空间（W+层=3）中，PCA能显著减少总优化时间，同时保持良好的视觉质量并提升SSIM指标；成功实现了AFHQ-Dog和AFHQ-Cat两个相似但不同数据域模型的图像对齐和可控操作。

Conclusion: 该方法为广泛的图像合成和编辑应用提供了高效且可解释的潜在空间控制可能性。

Abstract: This work integrates StyleGAN, DragGAN and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
to enhance the latent space efficiency and controllability of GAN-generated
images. Style-GAN provides a structured latent space, DragGAN enables intuitive
image manipulation, and PCA reduces dimensionality and facilitates cross-model
alignment for more streamlined and interpretable exploration of latent spaces.
We apply our techniques to the Animal Faces High Quality (AFHQ) dataset, and
find that our approach of integrating PCA-based dimensionality reduction with
the Drag-GAN framework for image manipulation retains performance while
improving optimization efficiency. Notably, introducing PCA into the latent W+
layers of DragGAN can consistently reduce the total optimization time while
maintaining good visual quality and even boosting the Structural Similarity
Index Measure (SSIM) of the optimized image, particularly in shallower latent
spaces (W+ layers = 3). We also demonstrate capability for aligning images
generated by two StyleGAN models trained on similar but distinct data domains
(AFHQ-Dog and AFHQ-Cat), and show that we can control the latent space of these
aligned images to manipulate the images in an intuitive and interpretable
manner. Our findings highlight the possibility for efficient and interpretable
latent space control for a wide range of image synthesis and editing
applications.

Motivation: 现有CLIP方法使用简单模板如'a photo of a [CLASS]'，忽略了视觉概念的层次性，且仅使用最后一层特征而忽略了早期层的层次信息。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法持续达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: HERMAN方法通过层次化表示匹配有效提升了CLIP在类增量学习中的性能，缓解了灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to endow models with the ability to
continuously adapt to evolving data streams. Recent advances in pre-trained
vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) provide a powerful foundation for this
task. However, existing approaches often rely on simplistic templates, such as
"a photo of a [CLASS]", which overlook the hierarchical nature of visual
concepts. For example, recognizing "cat" versus "car" depends on coarse-grained
cues, while distinguishing "cat" from "lion" requires fine-grained details.
Similarly, the current feature mapping in CLIP relies solely on the
representation from the last layer, neglecting the hierarchical information
contained in earlier layers. In this work, we introduce HiErarchical
Representation MAtchiNg (HERMAN) for CLIP-based CIL. Our approach leverages
LLMs to recursively generate discriminative textual descriptors, thereby
augmenting the semantic space with explicit hierarchical cues. These
descriptors are matched to different levels of the semantic hierarchy and
adaptively routed based on task-specific requirements, enabling precise
discrimination while alleviating catastrophic forgetting in incremental tasks.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: We introduce MinerU2.5, a 1.2B-parameter document parsing vision-language
model that achieves state-of-the-art recognition accuracy while maintaining
exceptional computational efficiency. Our approach employs a coarse-to-fine,
two-stage parsing strategy that decouples global layout analysis from local
content recognition. In the first stage, the model performs efficient layout
analysis on downsampled images to identify structural elements, circumventing
the computational overhead of processing high-resolution inputs. In the second
stage, guided by the global layout, it performs targeted content recognition on
native-resolution crops extracted from the original image, preserving
fine-grained details in dense text, complex formulas, and tables. To support
this strategy, we developed a comprehensive data engine that generates diverse,
large-scale training corpora for both pretraining and fine-tuning. Ultimately,
MinerU2.5 demonstrates strong document parsing ability, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, surpassing both
general-purpose and domain-specific models across various recognition tasks,
while maintaining significantly lower computational overhead.

Abstract: Can humans identify AI-generated (fake) videos and provide grounded reasons?
While video generation models have advanced rapidly, a critical dimension --
whether humans can detect deepfake traces within a generated video, i.e.,
spatiotemporal grounded visual artifacts that reveal a video as machine
generated -- has been largely overlooked. We introduce DeeptraceReward, the
first fine-grained, spatially- and temporally- aware benchmark that annotates
human-perceived fake traces for video generation reward. The dataset comprises
4.3K detailed annotations across 3.3K high-quality generated videos. Each
annotation provides a natural-language explanation, pinpoints a bounding-box
region containing the perceived trace, and marks precise onset and offset
timestamps. We consolidate these annotations into 9 major categories of
deepfake traces that lead humans to identify a video as AI-generated, and train
multimodal language models (LMs) as reward models to mimic human judgments and
localizations. On DeeptraceReward, our 7B reward model outperforms GPT-5 by
34.7% on average across fake clue identification, grounding, and explanation.
Interestingly, we observe a consistent difficulty gradient: binary fake v.s.
real classification is substantially easier than fine-grained deepfake trace
detection; within the latter, performance degrades from natural language
explanations (easiest), to spatial grounding, to temporal labeling (hardest).
By foregrounding human-perceived deepfake traces, DeeptraceReward provides a
rigorous testbed and training signal for socially aware and trustworthy video
generation.

*Jiaqi Liu,Lang Sun,Ronghao Fu,Bo Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Geo-CoT框架，通过两阶段对齐策略训练RSThinker模型，在遥感任务中实现可验证的多步推理，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在遥感复杂分析任务中表现不佳，因其端到端训练方式跳过了关键推理步骤，导致输出不可验证。

Method: 使用Geo-CoT380k数据集，采用两阶段对齐策略：先通过监督微调建立认知架构，再用GRPO优化推理策略。

Result: RSThinker模型在广泛任务中显著优于最先进模型，能同时输出最终答案和可验证的分析轨迹。

Conclusion: Geo-CoT框架为遥感分析提供了从感知到结构化可验证推理的具体路径，相关数据集和模型将公开发布。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in remote sensing often fail at complex
analytical tasks, a limitation stemming from their end-to-end training paradigm
that bypasses crucial reasoning steps and leads to unverifiable outputs. To
address this limitation, we introduce the Perceptually-Grounded Geospatial
Chain-of-Thought (Geo-CoT), a framework that models remote sensing analysis as
a verifiable, multi-step process. We instill this analytical process through a
two-stage alignment strategy, leveraging Geo-CoT380k, the first large-scale
dataset of structured Geo-CoT rationales. This strategy first employs
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to instill the foundational cognitive
architecture, then leverages Group Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) to refine
the model's reasoning policy towards factual correctness. The resulting model,
RSThinker, outputs both a final answer and its justifying, verifiable
analytical trace. This capability yields dominant performance, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art models across a comprehensive range of tasks.
The public release of our Geo-CoT380k dataset and RSThinker model upon
publication serves as a concrete pathway from opaque perception towards
structured, verifiable reasoning for Earth Observation.

### [120] [CapRL: Stimulating Dense Image Caption Capabilities via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22647)
*Long Xing,Xiaoyi Dong,Yuhang Zang,Yuhang Cao,Jianze Liang,Qidong Huang,Jiaqi Wang,Feng Wu,Dahua Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了CapRL框架，将强化学习与可验证奖励应用于图像描述生成任务，通过让非视觉语言模型基于描述回答问题来评估描述质量，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的图像描述模型依赖监督微调，需要昂贵的人工标注数据，导致模型记忆特定答案而缺乏泛化能力和创造性。需要克服SFT的局限性。

Method: 采用两阶段解耦管道：LVLM生成图像描述，然后由独立的非视觉LLM基于该描述回答多选题，根据回答准确率计算客观奖励。

Result: 在CapRL-5M数据集上预训练后，在12个基准测试中获得显著提升；在Prism评估框架中性能与Qwen2.5-VL-72B相当，平均超过基线8.4%。

Conclusion: CapRL是首个将RLVR应用于主观图像描述任务的研究，证明了该方法能有效提升描述质量，为图像描述任务提供了新的训练范式。

Abstract: Image captioning is a fundamental task that bridges the visual and linguistic
domains, playing a critical role in pre-training Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs). Current state-of-the-art captioning models are typically trained with
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), a paradigm that relies on expensive, non-scalable
data annotated by humans or proprietary models. This approach often leads to
models that memorize specific ground-truth answers, limiting their generality
and ability to generate diverse, creative descriptions. To overcome the
limitation of SFT, we propose applying the Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) paradigm to the open-ended task of image captioning.
A primary challenge, however, is designing an objective reward function for the
inherently subjective nature of what constitutes a "good" caption. We introduce
Captioning Reinforcement Learning (CapRL), a novel training framework that
redefines caption quality through its utility: a high-quality caption should
enable a non-visual language model to accurately answer questions about the
corresponding image. CapRL employs a decoupled two-stage pipeline where an LVLM
generates a caption, and the objective reward is derived from the accuracy of a
separate, vision-free LLM answering Multiple-Choice Questions based solely on
that caption. As the first study to apply RLVR to the subjective image
captioning task, we demonstrate that CapRL significantly enhances multiple
settings. Pretraining on the CapRL-5M caption dataset annotated by CapRL-3B
results in substantial gains across 12 benchmarks. Moreover, within the Prism
Framework for caption quality evaluation, CapRL achieves performance comparable
to Qwen2.5-VL-72B, while exceeding the baseline by an average margin of 8.4%.

*Jun He,Yi Lin,Zilong Huang,Jiacong Yin,Junyan Ye,Yuchuan Zhou,Weijia Li,Xiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UrbanFeel是一个评估多模态大语言模型在城市发展理解和主观环境感知方面性能的综合基准，包含14.3K个视觉问题，涵盖静态场景感知、时间变化理解和主观环境感知三个维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市发展影响着全球一半以上人口，需要从人类视角理解其结构和感知变化以实现可持续发展。现有基准在探索MLLMs在城市环境中的表现方面存在局限，缺乏对时间演化和与人类感知一致的主观城市环境感知的系统性探索。

Method: 收集全球11个代表性城市的多时相单视角和全景街景图像，通过空间聚类、基于规则的生成、模型辅助提示和人工标注的混合流程生成高质量问答对。

Result: 评估20个最先进的MLLMs，发现Gemini-2.5 Pro表现最佳，其准确率接近人类专家水平，平均差距仅为1.5%。大多数模型在基于场景理解的任务上表现良好，一些模型甚至在像素级变化检测方面超越人类标注者。但在需要时间推理的任务上表现显著下降。

Conclusion: UrbanFeel基准揭示了MLLMs在城市发展理解方面的优势和局限，为未来模型开发提供了重要指导，特别是在时间推理和主观感知维度。

Abstract: Urban development impacts over half of the global population, making
human-centered understanding of its structural and perceptual changes essential
for sustainable development. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
have shown remarkable capabilities across various domains, existing benchmarks
that explore their performance in urban environments remain limited, lacking
systematic exploration of temporal evolution and subjective perception of urban
environment that aligns with human perception. To address these limitations, we
propose UrbanFeel, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
performance of MLLMs in urban development understanding and subjective
environmental perception. UrbanFeel comprises 14.3K carefully constructed
visual questions spanning three cognitively progressive dimensions: Static
Scene Perception, Temporal Change Understanding, and Subjective Environmental
Perception. We collect multi-temporal single-view and panoramic street-view
images from 11 representative cities worldwide, and generate high-quality
question-answer pairs through a hybrid pipeline of spatial clustering,
rule-based generation, model-assisted prompting, and manual annotation. Through
extensive evaluation of 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs, we observe that Gemini-2.5
Pro achieves the best overall performance, with its accuracy approaching human
expert levels and narrowing the average gap to just 1.5\%. Most models perform
well on tasks grounded in scene understanding. In particular, some models even
surpass human annotators in pixel-level change detection. However, performance
drops notably in tasks requiring temporal reasoning over urban development.
Additionally, in the subjective perception dimension, several models reach
human-level or even higher consistency in evaluating dimension such as
beautiful and safety.

*Jiaping Yu,Muli Yang,Jiapeng Ji,Jiexi Yan,Cheng Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出EXCL方法解决无源无监督域自适应问题，通过双专家框架和检索增强交互优化管道，在无需源数据的情况下实现目标域适配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SFUDA方法要么只利用源模型预测，要么微调大型多模态模型，但都忽视了互补见解和目标数据的潜在结构。

Method: EXCL包含双专家框架（冻结源域模型+预训练视觉语言模型）和检索增强交互优化管道（三阶段：协同检索样本、分别微调专家、强制学习一致性）。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: EXCL方法通过双专家协作学习，在无源数据的情况下有效解决了域自适应问题。

Abstract: Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA) addresses the realistic
challenge of adapting a source-trained model to a target domain without access
to the source data, driven by concerns over privacy and cost. Existing SFUDA
methods either exploit only the source model's predictions or fine-tune large
multimodal models, yet both neglect complementary insights and the latent
structure of target data. In this paper, we propose the Experts Cooperative
Learning (EXCL). EXCL contains the Dual Experts framework and
Retrieval-Augmentation-Interaction optimization pipeline. The Dual Experts
framework places a frozen source-domain model (augmented with Conv-Adapter) and
a pretrained vision-language model (with a trainable text prompt) on equal
footing to mine consensus knowledge from unlabeled target samples. To
effectively train these plug-in modules under purely unsupervised conditions,
we introduce Retrieval-Augmented-Interaction(RAIN), a three-stage pipeline that
(1) collaboratively retrieves pseudo-source and complex target samples, (2)
separately fine-tunes each expert on its respective sample set, and (3)
enforces learning object consistency via a shared learning result. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach matches
state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于扩散模型的文本引导图像编辑虽然质量出色，但计算延迟过高，阻碍了实际应用，需要开发实时高效的编辑方法。

Method: 提出三步创新：1）一步式反转编辑管道避免迭代过程；2）背景保护技术选择性修改编辑区域特征；3）稀疏空间交叉注意力机制防止语义泄漏到背景。

Result: 实验表明FlashEdit在保持背景一致性和结构完整性的同时，编辑时间低于0.2秒，相比多步方法速度提升超过150倍。

Conclusion: FlashEdit实现了高保真度的实时图像编辑，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-guided image editing with diffusion models has achieved remarkable
quality but suffers from prohibitive latency, hindering real-world
applications. We introduce FlashEdit, a novel framework designed to enable
high-fidelity, real-time image editing. Its efficiency stems from three key
innovations: (1) a One-Step Inversion-and-Editing (OSIE) pipeline that bypasses
costly iterative processes; (2) a Background Shield (BG-Shield) technique that
guarantees background preservation by selectively modifying features only
within the edit region; and (3) a Sparsified Spatial Cross-Attention (SSCA)
mechanism that ensures precise, localized edits by suppressing semantic leakage
to the background. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlashEdit maintains
superior background consistency and structural integrity, while performing
edits in under 0.2 seconds, which is an over 150$\times$ speedup compared to
prior multi-step methods. Our code will be made publicly available at
https://github.com/JunyiWuCode/FlashEdit.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniMapGen是一个用于大规模地图构建的生成式框架，通过将车道线表示为离散序列并支持多模态输入，克服了传统卫星数据方法的局限性，实现了更完整平滑的地图向量生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统大规模地图构建方法依赖昂贵的专用数据采集车辆和人工标注，而现有卫星方法存在遮挡、数据过时等固有缺陷，以及感知方法向量化效率低导致道路不连续粗糙的问题。

Method: 1) 将车道线表示为离散序列并建立迭代策略生成更完整平滑的地图向量；2) 支持BEV、PV和文本提示等多模态输入的灵活架构；3) 开发状态更新策略确保大规模地图的全局连续性和一致性。

Result: 在OpenSatMap数据集上达到最先进性能，能够推断被遮挡道路并预测数据集中缺失的道路标注。

Conclusion: UniMapGen通过生成式方法和多模态输入有效解决了大规模地图构建中的关键挑战，代码将开源发布。

Abstract: Large-scale map construction is foundational for critical applications such
as autonomous driving and navigation systems. Traditional large-scale map
construction approaches mainly rely on costly and inefficient special data
collection vehicles and labor-intensive annotation processes. While existing
satellite-based methods have demonstrated promising potential in enhancing the
efficiency and coverage of map construction, they exhibit two major
limitations: (1) inherent drawbacks of satellite data (e.g., occlusions,
outdatedness) and (2) inefficient vectorization from perception-based methods,
resulting in discontinuous and rough roads that require extensive
post-processing. This paper presents a novel generative framework, UniMapGen,
for large-scale map construction, offering three key innovations: (1)
representing lane lines as \textbf{discrete sequence} and establishing an
iterative strategy to generate more complete and smooth map vectors than
traditional perception-based methods. (2) proposing a flexible architecture
that supports \textbf{multi-modal} inputs, enabling dynamic selection among
BEV, PV, and text prompt, to overcome the drawbacks of satellite data. (3)
developing a \textbf{state update} strategy for global continuity and
consistency of the constructed large-scale map. UniMapGen achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the OpenSatMap dataset. Furthermore, UniMapGen
can infer occluded roads and predict roads missing from dataset annotations.
Our code will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法分别处理网格重建和材质分解任务，难以重建高反射表面，且依赖外部模型先验来增强分解结果。

Method: 基于3D高斯泼溅，联合优化深度和法线质量相关属性，提出基于多视角光度变化的新型粗糙度监督策略，结合精心设计的损失和优化过程。

Result: 重建结果与最先进方法相当，生成三角形网格及其相关材质组件，适用于下游任务。

Conclusion: 该方法在广泛使用的数据集上验证有效，与最先进的表面重建方法进行定性比较，展示了其优越性。

Abstract: We propose a unified solution for mesh reconstruction and material
decomposition from multi-view images based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, referred
to as GS-2M. Previous works handle these tasks separately and struggle to
reconstruct highly reflective surfaces, often relying on priors from external
models to enhance the decomposition results. Conversely, our method addresses
these two problems by jointly optimizing attributes relevant to the quality of
rendered depth and normals, maintaining geometric details while being resilient
to reflective surfaces. Although contemporary works effectively solve these
tasks together, they often employ sophisticated neural components to learn
scene properties, which hinders their performance at scale. To further
eliminate these neural components, we propose a novel roughness supervision
strategy based on multi-view photometric variation. When combined with a
carefully designed loss and optimization process, our unified framework
produces reconstruction results comparable to state-of-the-art methods,
delivering triangle meshes and their associated material components for
downstream tasks. We validate the effectiveness of our approach with widely
used datasets from previous works and qualitative comparisons with
state-of-the-art surface reconstruction methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管强化学习在文档分析领域应用不广泛，但其增强的推理能力可能对下游任务有益，特别是在DeepSeek-R1成功展示了基于规则强化学习的有效性之后。

Method: 使用基于规则的强化学习方法，在文档图像分类任务上进行实验，考察三种不同的分布外场景：分布外图像、未见类别和不同模态。

Result: 强化学习在分布外数据上表现出更好的泛化能力，在三种不同的分布外场景中都显示出优势。

Conclusion: 基于规则的强化学习在文档图像分类任务中具有更好的泛化性能，特别是在处理分布外数据时表现优异。

Abstract: Rule-based reinforcement learning has been gaining popularity ever since
DeepSeek-R1 has demonstrated its success through simple verifiable rewards. In
the domain of document analysis, reinforcement learning is not as prevalent,
even though many downstream tasks may benefit from the emerging properties of
reinforcement learning, particularly the enhanced reason capabilities. We study
the effects of rule-based reinforcement learning with the task of Document
Image Classification which is one of the most commonly studied downstream tasks
in document analysis. We find that reinforcement learning tends to have better
generalisation capabilities to out-of-distritbution data, which we examine in
three different scenarios, namely out-of-distribution images, unseen classes
and different modalities. Our code is available at

TL;DR: VeloxSeg是一个轻量级3D医学图像分割框架，通过双流CNN-Transformer架构解决了效率与鲁棒性冲突问题，在保持低计算预算的同时显著提升分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 轻量级3D医学图像分割面临"效率/鲁棒性冲突"的根本约束，特别是在处理复杂解剖结构和异质模态时，需要克服轻量方法的脆弱表示问题。

Method: 采用可部署和可扩展的双流CNN-Transformer架构，包含配对窗口注意力(PWA)和Johnson-Lindenstrauss引理指导的卷积(JLC)，实现"一瞥-聚焦"原则，并通过模态交互和空间解耦知识转移(SDKT)增强表示能力。

Result: 在多模态基准测试中，VeloxSeg实现了26%的Dice系数提升，同时GPU吞吐量提高11倍，CPU吞吐量提高48倍。

Conclusion: VeloxSeg通过创新的架构设计和知识转移策略，成功解决了轻量级3D医学图像分割的效率与鲁棒性平衡问题，为实际部署提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Lightweight 3D medical image segmentation remains constrained by a
fundamental "efficiency / robustness conflict", particularly when processing
complex anatomical structures and heterogeneous modalities. In this paper, we
study how to redesign the framework based on the characteristics of
high-dimensional 3D images, and explore data synergy to overcome the fragile
representation of lightweight methods. Our approach, VeloxSeg, begins with a
deployable and extensible dual-stream CNN-Transformer architecture composed of
Paired Window Attention (PWA) and Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma-guided
convolution (JLC). For each 3D image, we invoke a "glance-and-focus" principle,
where PWA rapidly retrieves multi-scale information, and JLC ensures robust
local feature extraction with minimal parameters, significantly enhancing the
model's ability to operate with low computational budget. Followed by an
extension of the dual-stream architecture that incorporates modal interaction
into the multi-scale image-retrieval process, VeloxSeg efficiently models
heterogeneous modalities. Finally, Spatially Decoupled Knowledge Transfer
(SDKT) via Gram matrices injects the texture prior extracted by a
self-supervised network into the segmentation network, yielding stronger
representations than baselines at no extra inference cost. Experimental results
on multimodal benchmarks show that VeloxSeg achieves a 26% Dice improvement,
alongside increasing GPU throughput by 11x and CPU by 48x. Codes are available
at https://github.com/JinPLu/VeloxSeg.

built on non-local patch matching, which avoids the need for neural network

TL;DR: RAPID3是一个零更新基础生成器的框架，通过三个轻量级策略头实现图像级自适应加速，在保持生成质量的同时实现近3倍采样加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散变换器（DiTs）采样速度慢，而现有的训练免费加速器使用统一启发式策略，无法针对不同图像进行优化，动态神经网络虽然能实现自适应加速但微调成本高。

Method: 提出RAPID3框架，包含三个策略头：步长跳过、缓存重用和稀疏注意力，通过组相对策略优化（GRPO）在线训练策略参数，同时使用对抗性判别器增强奖励信号。

Result: 在包括Stable Diffusion 3和FLUX在内的最先进DiT骨干网络上，RAPID3实现了近3倍采样加速，同时保持竞争力的生成质量。

Conclusion: RAPID3成功解决了DiTs采样速度慢的问题，通过零更新基础生成器的方式实现了图像级自适应加速，为扩散变换器的实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) excel at visual generation yet remain hampered
by slow sampling. Existing training-free accelerators - step reduction, feature
caching, and sparse attention - enhance inference speed but typically rely on a
uniform heuristic or a manually designed adaptive strategy for all images,
leaving quality on the table. Alternatively, dynamic neural networks offer
per-image adaptive acceleration, but their high fine-tuning costs limit broader
applicability. To address these limitations, we introduce RAPID3: Tri-Level
Reinforced Acceleration Policies for Diffusion Transformers, a framework that
delivers image-wise acceleration with zero updates to the base generator.
Specifically, three lightweight policy heads - Step-Skip, Cache-Reuse, and
Sparse-Attention - observe the current denoising state and independently decide
their corresponding speed-up at each timestep. All policy parameters are
trained online via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) while the
generator remains frozen. Meanwhile, an adversarially learned discriminator
augments the reward signal, discouraging reward hacking by boosting returns
only when generated samples stay close to the original model's distribution.
Across state-of-the-art DiT backbones, including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX,
RAPID3 achieves nearly 3x faster sampling with competitive generation quality.

TL;DR: CircuitSense是一个评估多模态大语言模型在电路理解方面能力的综合基准，包含8000多个问题，涵盖从组件级原理图到系统级框图。研究发现当前模型在视觉感知任务上表现良好（85%以上准确率），但在符号推导和数学推理方面表现很差（低于19%），揭示了视觉解析与符号推理之间的关键差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工程设计需要从系统规范到组件实现的层次化抽象，每个层级都需要视觉理解与数学推理的结合。虽然多模态大语言模型在自然图像任务上表现出色，但它们从技术图表中提取数学模型的能力尚未被探索。

Method: 提出了CircuitSense基准，包含感知、分析和设计三个工程工作流程的评估。开发了层次化合成生成管道，包括基于网格的原理图生成器和带有自动推导符号方程标签的框图生成器。对6个最先进的多模态大语言模型进行了全面评估。

Result: 闭源模型在涉及组件识别和拓扑识别的感知任务上达到85%以上的准确率，但在符号推导和分析推理方面的性能低于19%。具有更强符号推理能力的模型在设计任务上始终获得更高的准确率。

Conclusion: 符号推理是工程能力的关键指标，数学理解在电路合成中起着基础性作用。当前模型在视觉到数学推理方面存在根本性限制，需要改进符号推理能力。

Abstract: Engineering design operates through hierarchical abstraction from system
specifications to component implementations, requiring visual understanding
coupled with mathematical reasoning at each level. While Multi-modal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) excel at natural image tasks, their ability to extract
mathematical models from technical diagrams remains unexplored. We present
\textbf{CircuitSense}, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating circuit
understanding across this hierarchy through 8,006+ problems spanning
component-level schematics to system-level block diagrams. Our benchmark
uniquely examines the complete engineering workflow: Perception, Analysis, and
Design, with a particular emphasis on the critical but underexplored capability
of deriving symbolic equations from visual inputs. We introduce a hierarchical
synthetic generation pipeline consisting of a grid-based schematic generator
and a block diagram generator with auto-derived symbolic equation labels.
Comprehensive evaluation of six state-of-the-art MLLMs, including both
closed-source and open-source models, reveals fundamental limitations in
visual-to-mathematical reasoning. Closed-source models achieve over 85\%
accuracy on perception tasks involving component recognition and topology
identification, yet their performance on symbolic derivation and analytical
reasoning falls below 19\%, exposing a critical gap between visual parsing and
symbolic reasoning. Models with stronger symbolic reasoning capabilities
consistently achieve higher design task accuracy, confirming the fundamental
role of mathematical understanding in circuit synthesis and establishing
symbolic reasoning as the key metric for engineering competence.

Motivation: 无人机摄影场景中的小目标检测面临双重挑战：检测小目标（<32像素）和在资源受限平台上保持实时效率。YOLO系列检测器在大目标检测中表现出色，但在无人机小目标检测中误报率显著更高。

Method: 提出分层扩展路径聚合网络（HEPAN）进行多尺度特征融合，引入倒置残差深度卷积块（IRDCB）和轻量级下采样（LDown）模块减少参数和计算复杂度，设计小目标检测头提升空间分辨率和特征融合能力。

Conclusion: HierLight-YOLO通过分层特征融合和轻量化设计，有效提升了无人机场景下小目标的实时检测精度和效率。

Abstract: The real-time detection of small objects in complex scenes, such as the
unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photography captured by drones, has dual
challenges of detecting small targets (<32 pixels) and maintaining real-time
efficiency on resource-constrained platforms. While YOLO-series detectors have
achieved remarkable success in real-time large object detection, they suffer
from significantly higher false negative rates for drone-based detection where
small objects dominate, compared to large object scenarios. This paper proposes
HierLight-YOLO, a hierarchical feature fusion and lightweight model that
enhances the real-time detection of small objects, based on the YOLOv8
architecture. We propose the Hierarchical Extended Path Aggregation Network
(HEPAN), a multi-scale feature fusion method through hierarchical cross-level
connections, enhancing the small object detection accuracy. HierLight-YOLO
includes two innovative lightweight modules: Inverted Residual Depthwise
Convolution Block (IRDCB) and Lightweight Downsample (LDown) module, which
significantly reduce the model's parameters and computational complexity
without sacrificing detection capabilities. Small object detection head is
designed to further enhance spatial resolution and feature fusion to tackle the
tiny object (4 pixels) detection. Comparison experiments and ablation studies
on the VisDrone2019 benchmark demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of

Abstract: The proliferation of disinformation, particularly in multimodal contexts
combining text and images, presents a significant challenge across digital
platforms. This study investigates the potential of large multimodal models
(LMMs) in detecting and mitigating false information. We propose to approach
multimodal disinformation detection by leveraging the advanced capabilities of
the GPT-4o model. Our contributions include: (1) the development of an
optimized prompt incorporating advanced prompt engineering techniques to ensure
precise and consistent evaluations; (2) the implementation of a structured
framework for multimodal analysis, including a preprocessing methodology for
images and text to comply with the model's token limitations; (3) the
definition of six specific evaluation criteria that enable a fine-grained
classification of content, complemented by a self-assessment mechanism based on
confidence levels; (4) a comprehensive performance analysis of the model across
multiple heterogeneous datasets Gossipcop, Politifact, Fakeddit, MMFakeBench,
and AMMEBA highlighting GPT-4o's strengths and limitations in disinformation
detection; (5) an investigation of prediction variability through repeated
testing, evaluating the stability and reliability of the model's
classifications; and (6) the introduction of confidence-level and
variability-based evaluation methods. These contributions provide a robust and
reproducible methodological framework for automated multimodal disinformation
analysis.

*Kaziwa Saleh,Zhyar Rzgar K Rostam,Sándor Szénási,Zoltán Vámossy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 利用预训练的GPT-4模型通过专门设计的提示来分析图像，预测物体间的遮挡顺序关系，构建遮挡矩阵以辅助其他遮挡处理任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉模型在处理复杂密集的真实世界图像时，遮挡问题仍是一个重大挑战，需要准确预测物体间的遮挡顺序关系。

Method: 通过为输入图像设计专门的提示，利用预训练的GPT-4模型分析图像并生成顺序预测，解析响应构建遮挡矩阵。

Result: 在COCOA和InstaOrder数据集上的评估结果显示，该模型能够利用语义上下文、视觉模式和常识知识产生更准确的顺序预测。

Conclusion: 与基线方法不同，该模型能够以零样本方式推理遮挡关系，无需标注训练数据，可轻松集成到遮挡处理框架中。

Abstract: Occlusion remains a significant challenge for current vision models to
robustly interpret complex and dense real-world images and scenes. To address
this limitation and to enable accurate prediction of the occlusion order
relationship between objects, we propose leveraging the advanced capability of
a pre-trained GPT-4 model to deduce the order. By providing a specifically
designed prompt along with the input image, GPT-4 can analyze the image and
generate order predictions. The response can then be parsed to construct an
occlusion matrix which can be utilized in assisting with other occlusion
handling tasks and image understanding. We report the results of evaluating the
model on COCOA and InstaOrder datasets. The results show that by using semantic
context, visual patterns, and commonsense knowledge, the model can produce more
accurate order predictions. Unlike baseline methods, the model can reason about
occlusion relationships in a zero-shot fashion, which requires no annotated
training data and can easily be integrated into occlusion handling frameworks.

*Haoyu Li,XiaoSong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于显著边界增强的多聚焦图像融合方法，通过梯度域模型和Tenengrad梯度检测生成高质量融合边界，在四个公开数据集上优于12种最先进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多聚焦图像融合方法难以保持清晰的聚焦-散焦边界，常导致模糊过渡和聚焦细节丢失，需要改进边界质量。

Method: 使用梯度域模型获得完整边界的初始融合结果，引入Tenengrad梯度检测提取显著特征，开发基于梯度和互补信息的聚焦度量来精炼边界。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法在主观和客观评估中始终优于12种最先进方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的基于显著边界增强的MFIF方法能够生成高质量的融合边界，有效检测聚焦信息，在图像融合任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Multi-focus image fusion (MFIF) aims to yield an all-focused image from
multiple partially focused inputs, which is crucial in applications cover
sur-veillance, microscopy, and computational photography. However, existing
methods struggle to preserve sharp focus-defocus boundaries, often resulting in
blurred transitions and focused details loss. To solve this problem, we propose
a MFIF method based on significant boundary enhancement, which generates
high-quality fused boundaries while effectively detecting focus in-formation.
Particularly, we propose a gradient-domain-based model that can obtain initial
fusion results with complete boundaries and effectively pre-serve the boundary
details. Additionally, we introduce Tenengrad gradient detection to extract
salient features from both the source images and the ini-tial fused image,
generating the corresponding saliency maps. For boundary refinement, we develop
a focus metric based on gradient and complementary information, integrating the
salient features with the complementary infor-mation across images to emphasize
focused regions and produce a high-quality initial decision result. Extensive
experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms 12 state-of-the-art methods in both subjective and objective
evaluations. We have realized codes in https://github.com/Lihyua/GICI

*Wenqiang Wang,Siyuan Liang,Xiao Yan,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了TDOA方法，通过聚类训练替代模型将动态输出场景转换为静态单输出场景，使用最远标签目标攻击策略提高攻击效果，在动态和静态输出场景中都取得了优异表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本对抗攻击方法主要针对静态场景，无法处理动态输出标签空间的问题，需要开发能适应动态输出场景的攻击方法。

Method: 使用基于聚类的替代模型训练方法将动态输出转换为静态单输出，提出最远标签目标攻击策略选择偏离模型粗粒度标签的对抗向量。

Result: 在4个数据集和8个受害者模型上评估，单次查询最大攻击成功率50.81%，在静态场景中最大ASR达82.68%，在生成式设置中也优于先前结果。

Conclusion: TDOA方法能有效攻击动态输出场景，在有限访问条件下具有破坏大语言模型的潜力，同时在传统静态场景中达到最先进性能。

Abstract: Text adversarial attack methods are typically designed for static scenarios
with fixed numbers of output labels and a predefined label space, relying on
extensive querying of the victim model (query-based attacks) or the surrogate
model (transfer-based attacks). To address this gap, we introduce the Textual
Dynamic Outputs Attack (TDOA) method, which employs a clustering-based
surrogate model training approach to convert the dynamic-output scenario into a
static single-output scenario. To improve attack effectiveness, we propose the
farthest-label targeted attack strategy, which selects adversarial vectors that
deviate most from the model's coarse-grained labels, thereby maximizing
disruption. We extensively evaluate TDOA on four datasets and eight victim
models (e.g., ChatGPT-4o, ChatGPT-4.1), showing its effectiveness in crafting
adversarial examples and its strong potential to compromise large language
models with limited access. With a single query per text, TDOA achieves a
maximum attack success rate of 50.81\%. Additionally, we find that TDOA also
achieves state-of-the-art performance in conventional static output scenarios,
reaching a maximum ASR of 82.68\%. Meanwhile, by conceptualizing translation
tasks as classification problems with unbounded output spaces, we extend the
TDOA framework to generative settings, surpassing prior results by up to 0.64
RDBLEU and 0.62 RDchrF.

*Luca Bergamin,Giovanna Maria Dimitri,Fabio Aiolli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出使用逻辑张量网络（LTNs）将医学背景知识编码到语义分割模型的损失函数中，以提高医学图像分割性能，特别是在训练数据稀缺的情况下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于深度学习的医学图像语义分割系统尚未完善，性能有待提升。作者认为通过将医学常识知识融入分割模型的损失函数可以改善性能。

Method: 使用逻辑张量网络（LTNs）通过一阶逻辑规则编码医学背景知识，包括分割形状约束和不同分割区域间的关系，并与SwinUNETR结合构建端到端语义分割框架。

Result: 在脑部MRI海马体分割任务上的实验表明，LTNs能够提升基线分割性能，特别是在训练数据稀缺的情况下表现更佳。

Conclusion: 尽管仍处于初步阶段，但神经符号方法具有足够的通用性，可以适应并应用于其他医学语义分割任务。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in medical image analysis, aiding
medical decision-making by helping radiologists distinguish objects in an
image. Research in this field has been driven by deep learning applications,
which have the potential to scale these systems even in the presence of noise
and artifacts. However, these systems are not yet perfected. We argue that
performance can be improved by incorporating common medical knowledge into the
segmentation model's loss function. To this end, we introduce Logic Tensor
Networks (LTNs) to encode medical background knowledge using first-order logic
(FOL) rules. The encoded rules span from constraints on the shape of the
produced segmentation, to relationships between different segmented areas. We
apply LTNs in an end-to-end framework with a SwinUNETR for semantic
segmentation. We evaluate our method on the task of segmenting the hippocampus
in brain MRI scans. Our experiments show that LTNs improve the baseline
segmentation performance, especially when training data is scarce. Despite
being in its preliminary stages, we argue that neurosymbolic methods are
general enough to be adapted and applied to other medical semantic segmentation
tasks.

*Xinhao Zhong,Yimin Zhou,Zhiqi Zhang,Junhao Li,Yi Sun,Bin Chen,Shu-Tao Xia,Ke Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出VARE框架和S-VARE方法，专门针对视觉自回归模型的概念擦除问题，通过辅助视觉令牌和过滤交叉熵损失实现精确的概念移除，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉自回归模型在文本到图像生成方面进展迅速，但带来了新的安全隐患。现有的概念擦除技术主要针对扩散模型，无法适用于自回归模型的逐令牌预测范式。

Method: 提出VARE框架利用辅助视觉令牌减少微调强度，S-VARE方法结合过滤交叉熵损失精确识别和调整不安全视觉令牌，以及保持损失来维持语义保真度。

Result: 大量实验证明该方法能够实现精确的概念擦除，同时保持生成质量，解决了朴素微调带来的语言漂移和多样性降低问题。

Conclusion: 该方法填补了自回归文本到图像生成中的安全空白，为视觉自回归模型提供了有效的概念擦除解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid progress of visual autoregressive (VAR) models has brought new
opportunities for text-to-image generation, but also heightened safety
concerns. Existing concept erasure techniques, primarily designed for diffusion
models, fail to generalize to VARs due to their next-scale token prediction
paradigm. In this paper, we first propose a novel VAR Erasure framework VARE
that enables stable concept erasure in VAR models by leveraging auxiliary
visual tokens to reduce fine-tuning intensity. Building upon this, we introduce
S-VARE, a novel and effective concept erasure method designed for VAR, which
incorporates a filtered cross entropy loss to precisely identify and minimally
adjust unsafe visual tokens, along with a preservation loss to maintain
semantic fidelity, addressing the issues such as language drift and reduced
diversity introduce by na\"ive fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach achieves surgical concept erasure while preserving generation
quality, thereby closing the safety gap in autoregressive text-to-image
generation by earlier methods.

### [138] [FreqDebias: Towards Generalizable Deepfake Detection via Consistency-Driven Frequency Debiasing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22412)
*Hossein Kashiani,Niloufar Alipour Talemi,Fatemeh Afghah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreqDebias是一个频率去偏框架，通过Fo-Mixup增强和双重一致性正则化来解决深度伪造检测器中的频谱偏置问题，显著提升了跨域泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造检测器由于从有限训练数据中学习到的偏置，往往难以泛化到新的伪造类型。本文识别了一种新的频率域模型偏置——频谱偏置，即检测器过度依赖特定频带，限制了其跨未见伪造的泛化能力。

Method: 提出FreqDebias框架：1）Fo-Mixup增强，动态多样化训练样本的频率特征；2）双重一致性正则化，通过类激活图实现局部一致性，通过超球面嵌入空间上的von Mises-Fisher分布实现全局一致性。

Result: 大量实验表明，FreqDebias显著增强了跨域泛化能力，在跨域和域内设置下均优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: FreqDebias通过解决频谱偏置问题，有效提升了深度伪造检测器的泛化性能，为频率域偏置研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Deepfake detectors often struggle to generalize to novel forgery types due to
biases learned from limited training data. In this paper, we identify a new
type of model bias in the frequency domain, termed spectral bias, where
detectors overly rely on specific frequency bands, restricting their ability to
generalize across unseen forgeries. To address this, we propose FreqDebias, a
frequency debiasing framework that mitigates spectral bias through two
complementary strategies. First, we introduce a novel Forgery Mixup (Fo-Mixup)
augmentation, which dynamically diversifies frequency characteristics of
training samples. Second, we incorporate a dual consistency regularization
(CR), which enforces both local consistency using class activation maps (CAMs)
and global consistency through a von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution on a
hyperspherical embedding space. This dual CR mitigates over-reliance on certain
frequency components by promoting consistent representation learning under both
local and global supervision. Extensive experiments show that FreqDebias
significantly enhances cross-domain generalization and outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both cross-domain and in-domain settings.

*Song Fei,Tian Ye,Lujia Wang,Lei Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LucidFlux是一个无需字幕的通用图像修复框架，通过适配大型扩散变换器(Flux.1)来解决混合退化问题，避免过度平滑、幻觉或漂移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在未知混合退化条件下往往过度平滑、产生幻觉或语义漂移，需要开发能保持语义的通用图像修复方法。

Method: 采用轻量级双分支条件器注入退化输入和轻度修复代理的信号，设计时间步和层级自适应调制方案，通过SigLIP特征实现无字幕语义对齐，并使用可扩展筛选流程进行结构丰富监督。

Result: 在合成和真实世界基准测试中，LucidFlux始终优于强大的开源和商业基线，消融研究验证了每个组件的必要性。

Conclusion: 对于大型DiTs，何时、何地以及如何调节——而不是增加参数或依赖文本提示——是实现稳健且无需字幕的通用图像修复的关键杠杆。

Abstract: Universal image restoration (UIR) aims to recover images degraded by unknown
mixtures while preserving semantics -- conditions under which discriminative
restorers and UNet-based diffusion priors often oversmooth, hallucinate, or
drift. We present LucidFlux, a caption-free UIR framework that adapts a large
diffusion transformer (Flux.1) without image captions. LucidFlux introduces a
lightweight dual-branch conditioner that injects signals from the degraded
input and a lightly restored proxy to respectively anchor geometry and suppress
artifacts. Then, a timestep- and layer-adaptive modulation schedule is designed
to route these cues across the backbone's hierarchy, in order to yield
coarse-to-fine and context-aware updates that protect the global structure
while recovering texture. After that, to avoid the latency and instability of
text prompts or MLLM captions, we enforce caption-free semantic alignment via
SigLIP features extracted from the proxy. A scalable curation pipeline further
filters large-scale data for structure-rich supervision. Across synthetic and
in-the-wild benchmarks, LucidFlux consistently outperforms strong open-source
and commercial baselines, and ablation studies verify the necessity of each
component. LucidFlux shows that, for large DiTs, when, where, and what to
condition on -- rather than adding parameters or relying on text prompts -- is
the governing lever for robust and caption-free universal image restoration in
the wild.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出U-MAN网络，通过多尺度自适应KAN和渐进注意力引导特征融合模块，解决医学图像分割中细节丢失和边界模糊问题，在多个数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统U-Net架构存在两个主要限制：(1)简单跳跃连接忽略了编码器-解码器之间的语义差距；(2)深层缺乏多尺度特征提取能力，导致医学图像分割中细粒度细节和精确边界难以保持。

Method: 提出U-MAN架构，包含两个核心模块：渐进注意力引导特征融合(PAGF)模块替代简单跳跃连接，使用注意力机制融合编码器和解码器特征；多尺度自适应KAN(MAN)模块使网络能够自适应处理多尺度特征。

Result: 在BUSI、GLAS和CVC三个公开数据集上的实验表明，U-MAN优于最先进的方法，特别是在定义准确边界和保留精细细节方面表现突出。

Conclusion: U-MAN通过结合多尺度自适应KAN和渐进注意力机制，有效解决了医学图像分割中的细节保持和边界精度问题，为复杂解剖结构和病理区域的分割提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation faces significant challenges in preserving
fine-grained details and precise boundaries due to complex anatomical
structures and pathological regions. These challenges primarily stem from two
key limitations of conventional U-Net architectures: (1) their simple skip
connections ignore the encoder-decoder semantic gap between various features,
and (2) they lack the capability for multi-scale feature extraction in deep
layers. To address these challenges, we propose the U-Net with Multi-scale
Adaptive KAN (U-MAN), a novel architecture that enhances the emerging
Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) with two specialized modules: Progressive
Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (PAGF) and the Multi-scale Adaptive KAN (MAN).
Our PAGF module replaces the simple skip connection, using attention to fuse
features from the encoder and decoder. The MAN module enables the network to
adaptively process features at multiple scales, improving its ability to
segment objects of various sizes. Experiments on three public datasets (BUSI,
GLAS, and CVC) show that U-MAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
particularly in defining accurate boundaries and preserving fine details.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为γ-Quant的任务特定非线性量化方法，用于在低带宽和能量受限环境下优化模式识别性能，在仅使用4位量化数据时能达到与12位原始数据相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模式识别模型使用为人类感知设计的预处理数据（如RGB图像、标准化浮点传感器数据），但在自动化分析场景中这种预处理可能不是最优的，且数据传输效率低下影响穿戴设备电池寿命。

Method: 针对低比特深度采集的传感器数据，提出γ-Quant方法，通过学习任务特定的非线性量化函数来优化模式识别性能。

Result: 在原始图像目标检测和可穿戴数据的人类活动识别任务中，使用可学习量化的4位原始数据性能与12位原始数据相当。

Conclusion: 任务特定的非线性量化方法能显著降低数据传输需求，同时保持模式识别性能，适用于低带宽和能量受限环境。

Abstract: Most pattern recognition models are developed on pre-proce\-ssed data. In
computer vision, for instance, RGB images processed through image signal
processing (ISP) pipelines designed to cater to human perception are the most
frequent input to image analysis networks. However, many modern vision tasks
operate without a human in the loop, raising the question of whether such
pre-processing is optimal for automated analysis. Similarly, human activity
recognition (HAR) on body-worn sensor data commonly takes normalized
floating-point data arising from a high-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC)
as an input, despite such an approach being highly inefficient in terms of data
transmission, significantly affecting the battery life of wearable devices. In
this work, we target low-bandwidth and energy-constrained settings where
sensors are limited to low-bit-depth capture. We propose $\gamma$-Quant,
i.e.~the task-specific learning of a non-linear quantization for pattern
recognition. We exemplify our approach on raw-image object detection as well as
HAR of wearable data, and demonstrate that raw data with a learnable
quantization using as few as 4-bits can perform on par with the use of raw
12-bit data. All code to reproduce our experiments is publicly available via

TL;DR: 提出了一种自监督训练框架SSVIF，用于分割导向的可见光和红外图像融合方法，无需分割标签即可学习高级语义特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决应用导向的VIF方法需要下游任务标注数据的问题，传统方法只关注融合图像质量，而应用导向方法需要分割或检测标签，数据获取成本高。

Method: 利用特征级融合分割和像素级融合分割之间的一致性，提出跨分割一致性自监督任务，设计两阶段训练策略和动态权重调整方法。

Result: 在公开数据集上的大量实验证明SSVIF的有效性，仅使用未标注的可见光-红外图像对训练，性能优于传统VIF方法，与有监督分割导向方法相当。

Conclusion: 提出的自监督框架SSVIF成功解决了应用导向VIF方法对标注数据的依赖问题，实现了无需分割标签的高性能图像融合。

Abstract: Visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) has gained significant attention in
recent years due to its wide application in tasks such as scene segmentation
and object detection. VIF methods can be broadly classified into traditional
VIF methods and application-oriented VIF methods. Traditional methods focus
solely on improving the quality of fused images, while application-oriented VIF
methods additionally consider the performance of downstream tasks on fused
images by introducing task-specific loss terms during training. However,
compared to traditional methods, application-oriented VIF methods require
datasets labeled for downstream tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation or object
detection), making data acquisition labor-intensive and time-consuming. To
address this issue, we propose a self-supervised training framework for
segmentation-oriented VIF methods (SSVIF). Leveraging the consistency between
feature-level fusion-based segmentation and pixel-level fusion-based
segmentation, we introduce a novel self-supervised task-cross-segmentation
consistency-that enables the fusion model to learn high-level semantic features
without the supervision of segmentation labels. Additionally, we design a
two-stage training strategy and a dynamic weight adjustment method for
effective joint learning within our self-supervised framework. Extensive
experiments on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
SSVIF. Remarkably, although trained only on unlabeled visible-infrared image
pairs, our SSVIF outperforms traditional VIF methods and rivals supervised
segmentation-oriented ones. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: Bézier Meets Diffusion框架有效解决了跨域医学影像生成问题，通过结合Bézier风格迁移和条件扩散模型，实现了高质量的跨域图像合成和分割性能提升。

Abstract: Training robust learning algorithms across different medical imaging
modalities is challenging due to the large domain gap. Unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) mitigates this problem by using annotated images from the
source domain and unlabeled images from the target domain to train the deep
models. Existing approaches often rely on GAN-based style transfer, but these
methods struggle to capture cross-domain mappings in regions with high
variability. In this paper, we propose a unified framework, B\'ezier Meets
Diffusion, for cross-domain image generation. First, we introduce a
B\'ezier-curve-based style transfer strategy that effectively reduces the
domain gap between source and target domains. The transferred source images
enable the training of a more robust segmentation model across domains.
Thereafter, using pseudo-labels generated by this segmentation model on the
target domain, we train a conditional diffusion model (CDM) to synthesize
high-quality, labeled target-domain images. To mitigate the impact of noisy
pseudo-labels, we further develop an uncertainty-guided score matching method
that improves the robustness of CDM training. Extensive experiments on public
datasets demonstrate that our approach generates realistic labeled images,
significantly augmenting the target domain and improving segmentation
performance.

*Xiangmo Zhao,Nan Yang,Yang Wang,Zhanwen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PSTTS模块，通过空间令牌净化和时间令牌选择两阶段处理，有效消除事件数据中的时空冗余令牌，在保持精度的同时显著提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于事件帧序列的方法忽视了事件数据固有的高空间稀疏性和帧间运动冗余，导致计算开销大；现有的RGB视频令牌稀疏化方法不适用于事件数据，因为它们依赖不可靠的中间令牌表示且忽略了事件噪声的影响。

Method: PSTTS包含两个阶段：1) 空间令牌净化 - 通过评估每个事件帧内事件的时空一致性来丢弃噪声和非事件区域；2) 时间令牌选择 - 通过评估相邻事件帧间的运动模式相似性来识别和移除冗余时间信息。该模块无需额外参数，可直接插入现有模型。

Result: 在HARDVS、DailyDVS-200和SeACT数据集上测试了UniformerV2、VideoSwin、EVMamba和ExACT四个骨干网络。在DailyDVS-200数据集上，PSTTS将FLOPs降低了29-43.6%，FPS提升了21.6-41.3%，同时保持了任务精度。

Conclusion: PSTTS通过利用原始事件数据中的时空分布特性，有效识别和丢弃时空冗余令牌，实现了精度和效率之间的最佳平衡，为事件数据处理提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Mainstream event-based spatio-temporal representation learning methods
typically process event streams by converting them into sequences of event
frames, achieving remarkable performance. However, they neglect the high
spatial sparsity and inter-frame motion redundancy inherent in event frame
sequences, leading to significant computational overhead. Existing token
sparsification methods for RGB videos rely on unreliable intermediate token
representations and neglect the influence of event noise, making them
ineffective for direct application to event data. In this paper, we propose
Progressive Spatio-Temporal Token Selection (PSTTS), a Plug-and-Play module for
event data without introducing any additional parameters. PSTTS exploits the
spatio-temporal distribution characteristics embedded in raw event data to
effectively identify and discard spatio-temporal redundant tokens, achieving an
optimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, PSTTS consists
of two stages, Spatial Token Purification and Temporal Token Selection. Spatial
Token Purification discards noise and non-event regions by assessing the
spatio-temporal consistency of events within each event frame to prevent
interference with subsequent temporal redundancy evaluation. Temporal Token
Selection evaluates the motion pattern similarity between adjacent event
frames, precisely identifying and removing redundant temporal information. We
apply PSTTS to four representative backbones UniformerV2, VideoSwin, EVMamba,
and ExACT on the HARDVS, DailyDVS-200, and SeACT datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that PSTTS achieves significant efficiency improvements.
Specifically, PSTTS reduces FLOPs by 29-43.6% and increases FPS by 21.6-41.3%
on the DailyDVS-200 dataset, while maintaining task accuracy. Our code will be
available.

Result: 在多个文本到图像基准测试中，GCPO在AR模型和统一多模态模型上都表现出有效性，仅使用30%的token就能超越全token优化的性能。

Conclusion: GCPO通过识别和优化关键token，有效提升了自回归视觉生成的性能，证明了token-wise优化策略的重要性。

Abstract: Recent studies have extended Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR) to autoregressive (AR) visual generation and achieved promising
progress. However, existing methods typically apply uniform optimization across
all image tokens, while the varying contributions of different image tokens for
RLVR's training remain unexplored. In fact, the key obstacle lies in how to
identify more critical image tokens during AR generation and implement
effective token-wise optimization for them. To tackle this challenge, we
propose $\textbf{G}$roup $\textbf{C}$ritical-token $\textbf{P}$olicy
$\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{GCPO}$), which facilitates effective policy
optimization on critical tokens. We identify the critical tokens in RLVR-based
AR generation from three perspectives, specifically: $\textbf{(1)}$ Causal
dependency: early tokens fundamentally determine the later tokens and final
image effect due to unidirectional dependency; $\textbf{(2)}$ Entropy-induced
spatial structure: tokens with high entropy gradients correspond to image
structure and bridges distinct visual regions; $\textbf{(3)}$ RLVR-focused
token diversity: tokens with low visual similarity across a group of sampled
images contribute to richer token-level diversity. For these identified
critical tokens, we further introduce a dynamic token-wise advantage weight to
encourage exploration, based on confidence divergence between the policy model
and reference model. By leveraging 30\% of the image tokens, GCPO achieves
better performance than GRPO with full tokens. Extensive experiments on
multiple text-to-image benchmarks for both AR models and unified multimodal
models demonstrate the effectiveness of GCPO for AR visual generation.

TL;DR: EAGLE是一个轻量级黑盒框架，用于解释多模态大语言模型中的自回归token生成，通过将生成的token归因于紧凑的感知区域，并量化语言先验和感知证据的相对影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉输入与自然语言输出对齐方面表现出色，但生成的token对视觉模态的依赖程度尚不清楚，这限制了模型的可解释性和可靠性。

Method: EAGLE引入了一个统一充分性（洞察分数）和必要性（必要性分数）的目标函数，通过贪心搜索在稀疏化图像区域上进行优化，实现忠实且高效的归因。

Result: 在开源MLLMs上的广泛实验表明，EAGLE在忠实性、定位性和幻觉诊断方面始终优于现有方法，同时需要显著更少的GPU内存。

Conclusion: EAGLE通过提供细粒度的模型决策可解释性，有效提升了多模态大语言模型的可解释性，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in aligning visual inputs with natural language outputs. Yet, the
extent to which generated tokens depend on visual modalities remains poorly
understood, limiting interpretability and reliability. In this work, we present
EAGLE, a lightweight black-box framework for explaining autoregressive token
generation in MLLMs. EAGLE attributes any selected tokens to compact perceptual
regions while quantifying the relative influence of language priors and
perceptual evidence. The framework introduces an objective function that
unifies sufficiency (insight score) and indispensability (necessity score),
optimized via greedy search over sparsified image regions for faithful and
efficient attribution. Beyond spatial attribution, EAGLE performs
modality-aware analysis that disentangles what tokens rely on, providing
fine-grained interpretability of model decisions. Extensive experiments across
open-source MLLMs show that EAGLE consistently outperforms existing methods in
faithfulness, localization, and hallucination diagnosis, while requiring
substantially less GPU memory. These results highlight its effectiveness and
practicality for advancing the interpretability of MLLMs. The code is available

TL;DR: 系统评估视觉语言模型在颜色命名方面的能力，发现模型在典型颜色上表现良好，但在非典型颜色上表现显著下降，且存在跨语言训练不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解视觉语言模型是否像人类一样命名颜色对于有效的人机交互至关重要，因为颜色是人类视觉感知的基本维度。

Method: 使用957个颜色样本，在五个代表性模型上复制经典颜色命名方法，进行跨语言分析和消融研究。

Result: 模型在典型颜色上准确率高，但在扩展的非典型颜色集上性能显著下降；识别出21个在所有模型中一致出现的颜色术语；发现语言模型架构独立于视觉处理能力显著影响颜色命名。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型在颜色命名方面存在局限性，特别是在非典型颜色和跨语言场景中，需要改进以更好地匹配人类颜色认知。

Abstract: Color serves as a fundamental dimension of human visual perception and a
primary means of communicating about objects and scenes. As vision-language
models (VLMs) become increasingly prevalent, understanding whether they name
colors like humans is crucial for effective human-AI interaction. We present
the first systematic evaluation of color naming capabilities across VLMs,
replicating classic color naming methodologies using 957 color samples across
five representative models. Our results show that while VLMs achieve high
accuracy on prototypical colors from classical studies, performance drops
significantly on expanded, non-prototypical color sets. We identify 21 common
color terms that consistently emerge across all models, revealing two distinct
approaches: constrained models using predominantly basic terms versus expansive
models employing systematic lightness modifiers. Cross-linguistic analysis
across nine languages demonstrates severe training imbalances favoring English
and Chinese, with hue serving as the primary driver of color naming decisions.
Finally, ablation studies reveal that language model architecture significantly
influences color naming independent of visual processing capabilities.

Motivation: 现有单目深度估计方法在3D重建和视图合成应用中难以同时满足几何一致性、细节保留、对反射表面等现实挑战的鲁棒性以及边缘设备效率等关键要求。

Method: 结合transformer架构与轻量卷积解码器，采用双模态密度头，使用合成图像、真实图像和伪标签图像进行训练，实施多阶段优化策略，并引入基于LPIPS的损失函数。

Result: 实验结果表明EfficientDepth在性能上达到或优于现有最先进模型，同时显著减少了计算资源需求。

Conclusion: EfficientDepth系统有效解决了单目深度估计中的关键挑战，在保持高质量深度估计的同时实现了计算效率的提升。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE) plays a pivotal role in various computer
vision applications, such as robotics, augmented reality, and autonomous
driving. Despite recent advancements, existing methods often fail to meet key
requirements for 3D reconstruction and view synthesis, including geometric
consistency, fine details, robustness to real-world challenges like reflective
surfaces, and efficiency for edge devices. To address these challenges, we
introduce a novel MDE system, called EfficientDepth, which combines a
transformer architecture with a lightweight convolutional decoder, as well as a
bimodal density head that allows the network to estimate detailed depth maps.
We train our model on a combination of labeled synthetic and real images, as
well as pseudo-labeled real images, generated using a high-performing MDE
method. Furthermore, we employ a multi-stage optimization strategy to improve
training efficiency and produce models that emphasize geometric consistency and
fine detail. Finally, in addition to commonly used objectives, we introduce a
loss function based on LPIPS to encourage the network to produce detailed depth
maps. Experimental results demonstrate that EfficientDepth achieves performance
comparable to or better than existing state-of-the-art models, with
significantly reduced computational resources.

Abstract: Category discovery (CD) is an emerging open-world learning task, which aims
at automatically categorizing unlabelled data containing instances from unseen
classes, given some labelled data from seen classes. This task has attracted
significant attention over the years and leads to a rich body of literature
trying to address the problem from different perspectives. In this survey, we
provide a comprehensive review of the literature, and offer detailed analysis
and in-depth discussion on different methods. Firstly, we introduce a taxonomy
for the literature by considering two base settings, namely novel category
discovery (NCD) and generalized category discovery (GCD), and several derived
settings that are designed to address the extra challenges in different
real-world application scenarios, including continual category discovery,
skewed data distribution, federated category discovery, etc. Secondly, for each
setting, we offer a detailed analysis of the methods encompassing three
fundamental components, representation learning, label assignment, and
estimation of class number. Thirdly, we benchmark all the methods and distill
key insights showing that large-scale pretrained backbones, hierarchical and
auxiliary cues, and curriculum-style training are all beneficial for category
discovery, while challenges remain in the design of label assignment, the
estimation of class numbers, and scaling to complex multi-object
scenarios.Finally, we discuss the key insights from the literature so far and
point out promising future research directions. We compile a living survey of

TL;DR: HyCoVAD是一个混合SSL-LLM模型，结合自监督学习和大型语言模型来检测复杂视频异常，在ComplexVAD数据集上达到72.5%的帧级AUC，比现有基线提升12.5%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂视频异常检测的挑战，这些异常由多个实体间的复杂关系和时序依赖定义，而非孤立动作。SSL方法难以理解交互的语义含义，而LLM虽然推理能力强但计算成本高且缺乏细粒度空间定位

Method: HyCoVAD结合多任务SSL时序分析器和LLM验证器。SSL模块基于nnFormer骨干网络，通过多个代理任务从视频帧中识别可疑异常帧，然后由LLM应用结构化、基于规则的推理来验证异常存在

Result: 在ComplexVAD数据集上达到72.5%帧级AUC，比现有基线提升12.5%，同时减少了LLM计算量

Conclusion: HyCoVAD成功结合SSL和LLM的优势，为复杂视频异常检测提供了有效解决方案，并发布了交互异常分类法、自适应阈值协议和代码以促进未来研究

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for intelligent surveillance, but a
significant challenge lies in identifying complex anomalies, which are events
defined by intricate relationships and temporal dependencies among multiple
entities rather than by isolated actions. While self-supervised learning (SSL)
methods effectively model low-level spatiotemporal patterns, they often
struggle to grasp the semantic meaning of these interactions. Conversely, large
language models (LLMs) offer powerful contextual reasoning but are
computationally expensive for frame-by-frame analysis and lack fine-grained
spatial localization. We introduce HyCoVAD, Hybrid Complex Video Anomaly
Detection, a hybrid SSL-LLM model that combines a multi-task SSL temporal
analyzer with LLM validator. The SSL module is built upon an nnFormer backbone
which is a transformer-based model for image segmentation. It is trained with
multiple proxy tasks, learns from video frames to identify those suspected of
anomaly. The selected frames are then forwarded to the LLM, which enriches the
analysis with semantic context by applying structured, rule-based reasoning to
validate the presence of anomalies. Experiments on the challenging ComplexVAD
dataset show that HyCoVAD achieves a 72.5% frame-level AUC, outperforming
existing baselines by 12.5% while reducing LLM computation. We release our
interaction anomaly taxonomy, adaptive thresholding protocol, and code to
facilitate future research in complex VAD scenarios.

TL;DR: SpikeMatch是首个用于脉冲神经网络的半监督学习框架，利用SNN的时间动态特性进行多样化伪标签生成，在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脉冲神经网络具有生物合理性和能效优势，但其半监督学习方法相比人工神经网络仍未被充分探索，需要开发专门针对SNN特性的SSL框架。

Method: 提出SpikeMatch框架，利用SNN泄漏因子的时间动态特性，在协同训练框架内进行多样化伪标签生成，通过弱增强未标记样本生成可靠伪标签来训练强增强样本。

Result: 实验表明SpikeMatch在多个标准基准测试中优于现有适应到SNN骨干网络的半监督学习方法。

Conclusion: SpikeMatch通过利用SNN的时间动态特性有效缓解确认偏差，在有限标签下捕获判别性特征，为SNN的半监督学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have recently been attracting significant
attention for their biological plausibility and energy efficiency, but
semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods for SNN-based models remain
underexplored compared to those for artificial neural networks (ANNs). In this
paper, we introduce SpikeMatch, the first SSL framework for SNNs that leverages
the temporal dynamics through the leakage factor of SNNs for diverse
pseudo-labeling within a co-training framework. By utilizing agreement among
multiple predictions from a single SNN, SpikeMatch generates reliable
pseudo-labels from weakly-augmented unlabeled samples to train on
strongly-augmented ones, effectively mitigating confirmation bias by capturing
discriminative features with limited labels. Experiments show that SpikeMatch
outperforms existing SSL methods adapted to SNN backbones across various
standard benchmarks.

TL;DR: LongLive是一个用于实时交互式长视频生成的帧级自回归框架，通过KV重缓存机制、流式长调优和帧级注意力汇聚等技术，在保持高质量的同时实现高效的长视频生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频生成面临效率和质量的挑战：扩散模型质量高但效率低，因果注意力AR模型支持快速推理但在长视频上质量下降。此外，交互式能力对于动态内容创作至关重要，但增加了视觉一致性和语义连贯性的复杂性。

Method: 采用因果帧级自回归设计，集成KV重缓存机制用于平滑提示切换，流式长调优实现长视频训练和训练-推理对齐，短窗口注意力配合帧级注意力汇聚保持长程一致性并加速生成。

Result: 仅用32 GPU天将13亿参数的短片段模型微调至分钟级生成，在单张NVIDIA H100上保持20.7 FPS，在VBench上短长视频均表现优异，支持单H100 GPU上240秒视频生成，INT8量化推理仅轻微质量损失。

Conclusion: LongLive通过创新的架构设计成功解决了长视频生成在效率、质量和交互性方面的挑战，为实时交互式长视频生成提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: We present LongLive, a frame-level autoregressive (AR) framework for
real-time and interactive long video generation. Long video generation presents
challenges in both efficiency and quality. Diffusion and Diffusion-Forcing
models can produce high-quality videos but suffer from low efficiency due to
bidirectional attention. Causal attention AR models support KV caching for
faster inference, but often degrade in quality on long videos due to memory
challenges during long-video training. In addition, beyond static prompt-based
generation, interactive capabilities, such as streaming prompt inputs, are
critical for dynamic content creation, enabling users to guide narratives in
real time. This interactive requirement significantly increases complexity,
especially in ensuring visual consistency and semantic coherence during prompt
transitions. To address these challenges, LongLive adopts a causal, frame-level
AR design that integrates a KV-recache mechanism that refreshes cached states
with new prompts for smooth, adherent switches; streaming long tuning to enable
long video training and to align training and inference (train-long-test-long);
and short window attention paired with a frame-level attention sink, shorten as
frame sink, preserving long-range consistency while enabling faster generation.
With these key designs, LongLive fine-tunes a 1.3B-parameter short-clip model
to minute-long generation in just 32 GPU-days. At inference, LongLive sustains
20.7 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100, achieves strong performance on VBench in both
short and long videos. LongLive supports up to 240-second videos on a single
H100 GPU. LongLive further supports INT8-quantized inference with only marginal
quality loss.

TL;DR: SPARK是一个高效的协同进化框架，通过回收RLVR中的轨迹和正确性数据来同时训练模型作为生成式奖励模型，无需单独奖励模型和人类偏好数据，实现了策略和奖励模型的协同进化。


<details>

Motivation: 解决RLHF成本高、奖励策略不匹配的问题，以及RLVR浪费监督信息的问题，通过回收利用轨迹和正确性数据来提高训练效率。

Method: 基于RLVR构建，回收轨迹和正确性数据来训练模型作为生成式奖励模型，使用点式奖励评分、成对比较和基于反思响应的评估等混合目标。

Result: 在多个LLM和LVLM模型上取得显著性能提升，SPARK-VL-7B在7个推理基准上平均提升9.7%，2个奖励基准上提升12.1%，8个通用基准上提升1.5%。

Conclusion: SPARK框架通过策略和奖励模型的协同进化，实现了高效稳定的训练，支持通过自反思进行测试时扩展，具有鲁棒性和广泛泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
increasingly use Reinforcement Learning (RL) for post-pretraining, such as RL
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for objective tasks and RL from Human Feedback
(RLHF) for subjective tasks. However, RLHF incurs high costs and potential
reward-policy mismatch due to reliance on human preferences, while RLVR still
wastes supervision by discarding rollouts and correctness signals after each
update. To address these challenges, we introduce the Synergistic Policy And
Reward Co-Evolving Framework (SPARK), an efficient, on-policy, and stable
method that builds on RLVR. Instead of discarding rollouts and correctness
data, SPARK recycles this valuable information to simultaneously train the
model itself as a generative reward model. This auxiliary training uses a mix
of objectives, such as pointwise reward score, pairwise comparison, and
evaluation conditioned on further-reflection responses, to teach the model to
evaluate and improve its own responses. Our process eliminates the need for a
separate reward model and costly human preference data. SPARK creates a
positive co-evolving feedback loop: improved reward accuracy yields better
policy gradients, which in turn produce higher-quality rollouts that further
refine the reward model. Our unified framework supports test-time scaling via
self-reflection without external reward models and their associated costs. We
show that SPARK achieves significant performance gains on multiple LLM and LVLM
models and multiple reasoning, reward models, and general benchmarks. For
example, SPARK-VL-7B achieves an average 9.7% gain on 7 reasoning benchmarks,
12.1% on 2 reward benchmarks, and 1.5% on 8 general benchmarks over the
baselines, demonstrating robustness and broad generalization.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CCNeXt的新型自监督卷积深度估计方法，在保持计算效率的同时超越了现有CNN和ViT模型，在KITTI和Driving Stereo数据集上实现了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度估计在机器人、自动驾驶和增强现实中至关重要，但这些应用通常受计算能力限制。由于难以在不同场景中获取可靠的深度真值数据，当有大量未标记数据集可用时，自监督技术成为解决方案。

Method: CCNeXt架构采用现代CNN特征提取器，在编码器中引入了新颖的窗口化极线交叉注意力模块，并对深度估计解码器进行了全面重新设计。

Result: 在KITTI Eigen Split测试数据上达到竞争性指标，比当前最佳模型快10.18倍，在KITTI Eigen Split改进真值和Driving Stereo数据集的所有指标上都实现了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: CCNeXt在深度估计任务中实现了性能与计算效率的良好平衡，为实际应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Depth Estimation plays a crucial role in recent applications in robotics,
autonomous vehicles, and augmented reality. These scenarios commonly operate
under constraints imposed by computational power. Stereo image pairs offer an
effective solution for depth estimation since it only needs to estimate the
disparity of pixels in image pairs to determine the depth in a known rectified
system. Due to the difficulty in acquiring reliable ground-truth depth data
across diverse scenarios, self-supervised techniques emerge as a solution,
particularly when large unlabeled datasets are available. We propose a novel
self-supervised convolutional approach that outperforms existing
state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers
(ViTs) while balancing computational cost. The proposed CCNeXt architecture
employs a modern CNN feature extractor with a novel windowed epipolar
cross-attention module in the encoder, complemented by a comprehensive redesign
of the depth estimation decoder. Our experiments demonstrate that CCNeXt
achieves competitive metrics on the KITTI Eigen Split test data while being
10.18$\times$ faster than the current best model and achieves state-of-the-art
results in all metrics in the KITTI Eigen Split Improved Ground Truth and
Driving Stereo datasets when compared to recently proposed techniques. To

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统思维链提示依赖非结构化文本，在具身任务中缺乏可解释性和可执行性。现有结构化CoT方法只能建模低阶关系，缺乏继承、行为抽象等构造，也没有标准化的顺序或条件规划语义。

Method: 提出UML-CoT框架，使用UML类图捕捉组合对象语义，活动图建模过程控制流。采用三阶段训练流程，结合监督微调和GRPO策略优化，包括从仅答案数据中学习奖励。

Result: 在MRoom-30k新基准测试中，UML-CoT在可解释性、规划连贯性和执行成功率方面均优于非结构化CoT。

Conclusion: UML作为一种更具表达力和可操作性的结构化推理形式化方法，能够有效提升语言模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning in large language models
(LLMs), but its reliance on unstructured text limits interpretability and
executability in embodied tasks. Prior work has explored structured CoTs using
scene or logic graphs, yet these remain fundamentally limited: they model only
low-order relations, lack constructs like inheritance or behavioral
abstraction, and provide no standardized semantics for sequential or
conditional planning. We propose UML-CoT, a structured reasoning and planning
framework that leverages Unified Modeling Language (UML) to generate symbolic
CoTs and executable action plans. UML class diagrams capture compositional
object semantics, while activity diagrams model procedural control flow. Our
three-stage training pipeline combines supervised fine-tuning with Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), including reward learning from answer-only
data. We evaluate UML-CoT on MRoom-30k, a new benchmark of cluttered
room-cleaning scenarios. UML-CoT outperforms unstructured CoTs in
interpretability, planning coherence, and execution success, highlighting UML
as a more expressive and actionable structured reasoning formalism.

Method: 采用基于大型多模态语言模型的中央编排器，通过多步推理执行三个核心能力：校准发现、可控合成和共识标注。共识标注通过结合非极大值抑制和投票机制协调多个基础模型。

Abstract: Curating high-quality, domain-specific datasets is a major bottleneck for
deploying robust vision systems, requiring complex trade-offs between data
quality, diversity, and cost when researching vast, unlabeled data lakes. We
introduce Labeling Copilot, the first data curation deep research agent for
computer vision. A central orchestrator agent, powered by a large multimodal
language model, uses multi-step reasoning to execute specialized tools across
three core capabilities: (1) Calibrated Discovery sources relevant,
in-distribution data from large repositories; (2) Controllable Synthesis
generates novel data for rare scenarios with robust filtering; and (3)
Consensus Annotation produces accurate labels by orchestrating multiple
foundation models via a novel consensus mechanism incorporating non-maximum
suppression and voting. Our large-scale validation proves the effectiveness of
Labeling Copilot's components. The Consensus Annotation module excels at object
discovery: on the dense COCO dataset, it averages 14.2 candidate proposals per
image-nearly double the 7.4 ground-truth objects-achieving a final annotation
mAP of 37.1%. On the web-scale Open Images dataset, it navigated extreme class
imbalance to discover 903 new bounding box categories, expanding its capability
to over 1500 total. Concurrently, our Calibrated Discovery tool, tested at a
10-million sample scale, features an active learning strategy that is up to 40x
more computationally efficient than alternatives with equivalent sample
efficiency. These experiments validate that an agentic workflow with optimized,
scalable tools provides a robust foundation for curating industrial-scale
datasets.

Result: 在十个基准数据集上实现最先进或相当的性能，特别在细粒度分类任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: 通过正负引导的双图像提示生成类别判别特征的方法有效，消除了生成模型适应或依赖外部工具的需求。

Abstract: Few-shot image classification remains challenging due to the limited
availability of labeled examples. Recent approaches have explored generating
synthetic training data using text-to-image diffusion models, but often require
extensive model fine-tuning or external information sources. We present a novel
training-free approach, called DIPSY, that leverages IP-Adapter for
image-to-image translation to generate highly discriminative synthetic images
using only the available few-shot examples. DIPSY introduces three key
innovations: (1) an extended classifier-free guidance scheme that enables
independent control over positive and negative image conditioning; (2) a class
similarity-based sampling strategy that identifies effective contrastive
examples; and (3) a simple yet effective pipeline that requires no model
fine-tuning or external captioning and filtering. Experiments across ten
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art or
comparable performance, while eliminating the need for generative model
adaptation or reliance on external tools for caption generation and image
filtering. Our results highlight the effectiveness of leveraging dual image
prompting with positive-negative guidance for generating class-discriminative

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文重新审视视觉自回归生成(VAR)模型，发现当配备马尔可夫注意力掩码时，VAR在数学上等价于离散扩散模型，建立了自回归变换器与扩散模型之间的理论桥梁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归变换器在视觉生成中表现出色，甚至超越了基于扩散的模型。本文旨在探索VAR与扩散模型之间的理论联系，以结合两者的优势。

Method: 提出SRDD方法，将VAR重新解释为离散扩散模型，利用马尔可夫注意力掩码建立数学等价性，并引入扩散模型的迭代精炼等优势。

Result: 实验表明，这种基于扩散的VAR视角在多个数据集上带来了一致的效率和生成质量提升，包括更快的收敛速度、更低的推理成本和改进的零样本重建能力。

Conclusion: 通过建立自回归变换器与扩散模型之间的理论桥梁，成功将扩散模型的优势引入VAR，实现了更高效的视觉生成。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) transformers have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
visual generation, largely due to their scalability, computational efficiency
and unified architecture with language and vision. Among them, next scale
prediction Visual Autoregressive Generation (VAR) has recently demonstrated
remarkable performance, even surpassing diffusion-based models. In this work,
we revisit VAR and uncover a theoretical insight: when equipped with a
Markovian attention mask, VAR is mathematically equivalent to a discrete
diffusion. We term this reinterpretation as Scalable Visual Refinement with
Discrete Diffusion (SRDD), establishing a principled bridge between AR
transformers and diffusion models. Leveraging this new perspective, we show how
one can directly import the advantages of diffusion such as iterative
refinement and reduce architectural inefficiencies into VAR, yielding faster
convergence, lower inference cost, and improved zero-shot reconstruction.
Across multiple datasets, we show that the diffusion based perspective of VAR
leads to consistent gains in efficiency and generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出RefAM框架，无需训练或架构修改，直接利用扩散变换器的注意力特征进行指代分割，通过处理停用词和全局注意力汇来提升性能，在零样本图像和视频分割基准上达到新SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指代分割方法通常需要微调或组合多个预训练模型，而大规模生成扩散模型编码了丰富的语义信息，可作为通用特征提取器。

Method: 利用扩散变换器的注意力分数，识别停用词作为注意力磁铁，处理深层出现的全局注意力汇，提出注意力重分配策略，开发无需训练的RefAM框架。

Result: 在零样本指代图像和视频分割基准上持续优于先前方法，无需微调或额外组件即达到新的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 扩散变换器的注意力特征可直接用于下游任务，通过适当的注意力处理策略可实现强大的零样本指代分割性能。

Abstract: Most existing approaches to referring segmentation achieve strong performance
only through fine-tuning or by composing multiple pre-trained models, often at
the cost of additional training and architectural modifications. Meanwhile,
large-scale generative diffusion models encode rich semantic information,
making them attractive as general-purpose feature extractors. In this work, we
introduce a new method that directly exploits features, attention scores, from
diffusion transformers for downstream tasks, requiring neither architectural
modifications nor additional training. To systematically evaluate these
features, we extend benchmarks with vision-language grounding tasks spanning
both images and videos. Our key insight is that stop words act as attention
magnets: they accumulate surplus attention and can be filtered to reduce noise.
Moreover, we identify global attention sinks (GAS) emerging in deeper layers
and show that they can be safely suppressed or redirected onto auxiliary
tokens, leading to sharper and more accurate grounding maps. We further propose
an attention redistribution strategy, where appended stop words partition
background activations into smaller clusters, yielding sharper and more
localized heatmaps. Building on these findings, we develop RefAM, a simple
training-free grounding framework that combines cross-attention maps, GAS
handling, and redistribution. Across zero-shot referring image and video
segmentation benchmarks, our approach consistently outperforms prior methods,
establishing a new state of the art without fine-tuning or additional
components.

TL;DR: VISION是一个端到端的自主检查系统，结合视觉语言模型和受限视点规划，用于自主检查运河涵洞，无需领域特定微调即可生成高分辨率图像报告。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人工检查运河涵洞存在年龄、几何形状、照明差、天气和难以接近等挑战，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 使用网络级视觉语言模型生成开放词汇ROI建议，融合立体深度恢复尺度，通过规划器在涵洞约束下重新定位拍摄目标特写。

Result: 在伊利运河涵洞部署的四足机器人上，初始ROI建议与专家达成61.4%一致，重新成像后评估达到80%一致。

Conclusion: VISION能够将初步假设转化为基于事实、与专家一致的发现，实现了自主检查涵洞的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Culverts on canals such as the Erie Canal, built originally in 1825, require
frequent inspections to ensure safe operation. Human inspection of culverts is
challenging due to age, geometry, poor illumination, weather, and lack of easy
access. We introduce VISION, an end-to-end, language-in-the-loop autonomy
system that couples a web-scale vision-language model (VLM) with constrained
viewpoint planning for autonomous inspection of culverts. Brief prompts to the
VLM solicit open-vocabulary ROI proposals with rationales and confidences,
stereo depth is fused to recover scale, and a planner -- aware of culvert
constraints -- commands repositioning moves to capture targeted close-ups.
Deployed on a quadruped in a culvert under the Erie Canal, VISION closes the
see, decide, move, re-image loop on-board and produces high-resolution images
for detailed reporting without domain-specific fine-tuning. In an external
evaluation by New York Canal Corporation personnel, initial ROI proposals
achieved 61.4\% agreement with subject-matter experts, and final
post-re-imaging assessments reached 80\%, indicating that VISION converts
tentative hypotheses into grounded, expert-aligned findings.

Abstract: This paper presents the design of a new soft-rigid robotic platform,
"GeoGami". We leverage origami surface capabilities to achieve shape
contraction and to support locomotion with underactuated forms. A key challenge
is that origami surfaces have high degrees of freedom and typically require
many actuators; we address repeatability by integrating surface compliance. We
propose a mono-actuated GeoGami mobile platform that combines origami surface
compliance with a geometric compliant skeleton, enabling the robot to transform
and locomote using a single actuator. We demonstrate the robot, develop a
stiffness model, and describe the central gearbox mechanism. We also analyze
alternative cable-driven actuation methods for the skeleton to enable surface
transformation. Finally, we evaluate the GeoGami platform for capabilities,
including shape transformation and rolling. This platform opens new
capabilities for robots that change shape to access different environments and
that use shape transformation for locomotion.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对四旋翼无人机在近壁环境中受空气动力学影响的解决方案，包括基于物理的吸力模型和吸力补偿模型预测控制框架，显著提升了轨迹跟踪精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 四旋翼无人机在近壁城市或室内环境（如检查和搜救任务）中安全运行面临未建模空气动力学效应的挑战，壁面接近会产生复杂涡流，引起不稳定吸力，可能导致危险振动或碰撞。

Method: 开发了基于物理的吸力模型，明确表征了转子速度和壁距的依赖关系；设计了吸力补偿模型预测控制（SC-MPC）框架，将增强的动态模型纳入因子图优化问题，整合系统动态约束、轨迹跟踪目标、控制输入平滑要求和执行器物理限制。

Result: 实验验证显示SC-MPC在X轴和Y轴位置控制中分别达到2.1厘米和2.0厘米的均方根误差，相比级联PID控制分别提升74%和79%，相比标准MPC分别提升60%和53%。平均绝对误差指标（X轴1.2厘米，Y轴1.4厘米）同样优于两个基线。

Conclusion: SC-MPC框架有效解决了四旋翼无人机在近壁环境中的空气动力学挑战，显著提高了轨迹跟踪精度和稳定性，为安全近壁操作提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: The safe operation of quadrotors in near-wall urban or indoor environments
(e.g., inspection and search-and-rescue missions) is challenged by unmodeled
aerodynamic effects arising from wall-proximity. It generates complex vortices
that induce destabilizing suction forces, potentially leading to hazardous
vibrations or collisions. This paper presents a comprehensive solution
featuring (1) a physics-based suction force model that explicitly characterizes
the dependency on both rotor speed and wall distance, and (2) a
suction-compensated model predictive control (SC-MPC) framework designed to
ensure accurate and stable trajectory tracking during wall-proximity
operations. The proposed SC-MPC framework incorporates an enhanced dynamics
model that accounts for suction force effects, formulated as a factor graph
optimization problem integrating system dynamics constraints, trajectory
tracking objectives, control input smoothness requirements, and actuator
physical limitations. The suction force model parameters are systematically
identified through extensive experimental measurements across varying
operational conditions. Experimental validation demonstrates SC-MPC's superior
performance, achieving 2.1 cm root mean squared error (RMSE) in X-axis and 2.0
cm RMSE in Y-axis position control - representing 74% and 79% improvements over
cascaded proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control, and 60% and 53%
improvements over standard MPC respectively. The corresponding mean absolute
error (MAE) metrics (1.2 cm X-axis, 1.4 cm Y-axis) similarly outperform both
baselines. The evaluation platform employs a ducted quadrotor design that
provides collision protection while maintaining aerodynamic efficiency. To
facilitate reproducibility and community adoption, we have open-sourced our
complete implementation, available at
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SC-MPC-6A61.

Result: 相比分布式非联邦学习框架，DroneFL将预测误差降低6%-83%，跟踪距离减少0.4%-4.6%，在树莓派5上实时运行，平均云端数据率仅为1.56 KBps。

Conclusion: DroneFL成功解决了多无人机目标跟踪中的联邦学习挑战，在保持高效性的同时显著提升了跟踪性能，为实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Multi-robot target tracking is a fundamental problem that requires
coordinated monitoring of dynamic entities in applications such as precision
agriculture, environmental monitoring, disaster response, and security
surveillance. While Federated Learning (FL) has the potential to enhance
learning across multiple robots without centralized data aggregation, its use
in multi-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) target tracking remains largely
underexplored. Key challenges include limited onboard computational resources,
significant data heterogeneity in FL due to varying targets and the fields of
view, and the need for tight coupling between trajectory prediction and
multi-robot planning. In this paper, we introduce DroneFL, the first federated
learning framework specifically designed for efficient multi-UAV target
tracking. We design a lightweight local model to predict target trajectories
from sensor inputs, using a frozen YOLO backbone and a shallow transformer for
efficient onboard training. The updated models are periodically aggregated in
the cloud for global knowledge sharing. To alleviate the data heterogeneity
that hinders FL convergence, DroneFL introduces a position-invariant model
architecture with altitude-based adaptive instance normalization. Finally, we
fuse predictions from multiple UAVs in the cloud and generate optimal
trajectories that balance target prediction accuracy and overall tracking
performance. Our results show that DroneFL reduces prediction error by 6%-83%
and tracking distance by 0.4%-4.6% compared to a distributed non-FL framework.
In terms of efficiency, DroneFL runs in real time on a Raspberry Pi 5 and has
on average just 1.56 KBps data rate to the cloud.

Method: 基础模型生成规划领域作为引擎，产生符号化问题-规划对作为推理轨迹，然后通过自然语言解释转化为扩展的CoT轨迹，实现符号规划结构与自然语言推理的显式对齐。

Result: 生成的数据超越了模型固有的规划能力，通过微调产生了规划增强的LLM，具有改进的规划成功率、更强的跨任务泛化能力和降低的推理成本。

Conclusion: Plan2Evolve框架能够自我生成高质量推理数据，有效提升LLM在机器人任务规划中的性能，减少对人工标注的依赖。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown strong potential in robotic
task planning, particularly through automatic planning domain generation that
integrates symbolic search. Prior approaches, however, have largely treated
these domains as search utilities, with limited attention to their potential as
scalable sources of reasoning data. At the same time, progress in reasoning
LLMs has been driven by chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision, whose application
in robotics remains dependent on costly, human-curated datasets. We propose
Plan2Evolve, an LLM self-evolving framework in which the base model generates
planning domains that serve as engines for producing symbolic problem-plan
pairs as reasoning traces. These pairs are then transformed into extended CoT
trajectories by the same model through natural-language explanations, thereby
explicitly aligning symbolic planning structures with natural language
reasoning. The resulting data extend beyond the model's intrinsic planning
capacity, enabling model fine-tuning that yields a planning-enhanced LLM with
improved planning success, stronger cross-task generalization, and reduced
inference costs.

Abstract: Vision-based odometry has been widely adopted in autonomous driving owing to
its low cost and lightweight setup; however, its performance often degrades in
complex outdoor urban environments. To address these challenges, we propose
PL-VIWO2, a filter-based visual-inertial-wheel odometry system that integrates
an IMU, wheel encoder, and camera (supporting both monocular and stereo) for

feature processing framework that exploits the geometric relationship between
2D feature points and lines, enabling fast and robust line tracking and
triangulation while ensuring real-time performance; (ii) an SE(2)-constrained
SE(3) wheel pre-integration method that leverages the planar motion
characteristics of ground vehicles for accurate wheel updates; and (iii) an
efficient motion consistency check (MCC) that filters out dynamic features by
jointly using IMU and wheel measurements. Extensive experiments on Monte Carlo
simulations and public autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that PL-VIWO2
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and
robustness.

Abstract: Autonomous docking between Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and ground robots
is essential for heterogeneous systems, yet most existing approaches target
wheeled platforms whose limited mobility constrains exploration in complex
terrains. Quadruped robots offer superior adaptability but undergo frequent
posture variations, making it difficult to provide a stable landing surface for
UAVs. To address these challenges, we propose an autonomous UAV-quadruped
docking framework for GPS-denied environments. On the quadruped side, a Hybrid
Internal Model with Horizontal Alignment (HIM-HA), learned via deep
reinforcement learning, actively stabilizes the torso to provide a level
platform. On the UAV side, a three-phase strategy is adopted, consisting of
long-range acquisition with a median-filtered YOLOv8 detector, close-range
tracking with a constraint-aware controller that integrates a Nonsingular Fast
Terminal Sliding Mode Controller (NFTSMC) and a logarithmic Barrier Function
(BF) to guarantee finite-time error convergence under field-of-view (FOV)
constraints, and terminal descent guided by a Safety Period (SP) mechanism that
jointly verifies tracking accuracy and platform stability. The proposed
framework is validated in both simulation and real-world scenarios,
successfully achieving docking on outdoor staircases higher than 17 cm and
rough slopes steeper than 30 degrees. Supplementary materials and videos are

Motivation: 对象级SLAM由于稀疏观测导致优化约束不足，传统方法获取常识知识先验费时且缺乏跨类别的泛化能力。

Method: 利用大型语言模型提供物体尺寸和方向的常识知识作为图SLAM框架中的先验因子，特别在观测有限时发挥作用，实现了稀疏物体特征的鲁棒数据关联和实时对象SLAM。

Conclusion: 通过集成LLM提供的常识知识先验，有效解决了对象级SLAM中的稀疏观测问题，显著提升了建图精度和实时性能。

Abstract: Object-level Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), which incorporates
semantic information for high-level scene understanding, faces challenges of
under-constrained optimization due to sparse observations. Prior work has
introduced additional constraints using commonsense knowledge, but obtaining
such priors has traditionally been labor-intensive and lacks generalizability
across diverse object categories. We address this limitation by leveraging
large language models (LLMs) to provide commonsense knowledge of object
geometric attributes, specifically size and orientation, as prior factors in a
graph-based SLAM framework. These priors are particularly beneficial during the
initial phase when object observations are limited. We implement a complete
pipeline integrating these priors, achieving robust data association on sparse
object-level features and enabling real-time object SLAM. Our system, evaluated
on the TUM RGB-D and 3RScan datasets, improves mapping accuracy by 36.8\% over
the latest baseline. Additionally, we present real-world experiments in the
supplementary video, demonstrating its real-time performance.

Conclusion: 该方法成功将物理稳定性集成到生成模型中，提供了一种高效准确的物体放置解决方案，可直接应用于现成模型。

Abstract: Stably placing an object in a multi-object scene is a fundamental challenge
in robotic manipulation, as placements must be penetration-free, establish
precise surface contact, and result in a force equilibrium. To assess
stability, existing methods rely on running a simulation engine or resort to
heuristic, appearance-based assessments. In contrast, our approach integrates
stability directly into the sampling process of a diffusion model. To this end,
we query an offline sampling-based planner to gather multi-modal placement
labels and train a diffusion model to generate stable placements. The diffusion
model is conditioned on scene and object point clouds, and serves as a
geometry-aware prior. We leverage the compositional nature of score-based
generative models to combine this learned prior with a stability-aware loss,
thereby increasing the likelihood of sampling from regions of high stability.
Importantly, this strategy requires no additional re-training or fine-tuning,
and can be directly applied to off-the-shelf models. We evaluate our method on
four benchmark scenes where stability can be accurately computed. Our
physics-guided models achieve placements that are 56% more robust to forceful
perturbations while reducing runtime by 47% compared to a state-of-the-art
geometric method.

Abstract: Humanoid table tennis (TT) demands rapid perception, proactive whole-body
motion, and agile footwork under strict timing -- capabilities that remain
difficult for unified controllers. We propose a reinforcement learning
framework that maps ball-position observations directly to whole-body joint
commands for both arm striking and leg locomotion, strengthened by predictive
signals and dense, physics-guided rewards. A lightweight learned predictor, fed
with recent ball positions, estimates future ball states and augments the
policy's observations for proactive decision-making. During training, a
physics-based predictor supplies precise future states to construct dense,
informative rewards that lead to effective exploration. The resulting policy
attains strong performance across varied serve ranges (hit rate $\geq$ 96% and
success rate $\geq$ 92%) in simulations. Ablation studies confirm that both the
learned predictor and the predictive reward design are critical for end-to-end
learning. Deployed zero-shot on a physical Booster T1 humanoid with 23 revolute
joints, the policy produces coordinated lateral and forward-backward footwork
with accurate, fast returns, suggesting a practical path toward versatile,
competitive humanoid TT.

Conclusion: 通过将人类先验与视觉语言锚定适应相结合，为无结构环境中的实用和多功能双臂操作迈出了一步。

Abstract: Achieving generalizable bimanual manipulation requires systems that can learn
efficiently from minimal human input while adapting to real-world uncertainties
and diverse embodiments. Existing approaches face a dilemma: imitation policy
learning demands extensive demonstrations to cover task variations, while
modular methods often lack flexibility in dynamic scenes. We introduce VLBiMan,
a framework that derives reusable skills from a single human example through
task-aware decomposition, preserving invariant primitives as anchors while
dynamically adapting adjustable components via vision-language grounding. This
adaptation mechanism resolves scene ambiguities caused by background changes,
object repositioning, or visual clutter without policy retraining, leveraging
semantic parsing and geometric feasibility constraints. Moreover, the system
inherits human-like hybrid control capabilities, enabling mixed synchronous and
asynchronous use of both arms. Extensive experiments validate VLBiMan across
tool-use and multi-object tasks, demonstrating: (1) a drastic reduction in
demonstration requirements compared to imitation baselines, (2) compositional
generalization through atomic skill splicing for long-horizon tasks, (3)
robustness to novel but semantically similar objects and external disturbances,
and (4) strong cross-embodiment transfer, showing that skills learned from
human demonstrations can be instantiated on different robotic platforms without
retraining. By bridging human priors with vision-language anchored adaptation,
our work takes a step toward practical and versatile dual-arm manipulation in
unstructured settings.

Abstract: Playful deception, a common feature in human social interactions, remains
underexplored in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). Inspired by the Turkish Ice
Cream (TIC) vendor routine, we investigate how bounded, culturally familiar
forms of deception influence user trust, enjoyment, and engagement during
robotic handovers. We design a robotic manipulator equipped with a custom
end-effector and implement five TIC-inspired trick policies that deceptively
delay the handover of an ice cream-shaped object. Through a mixed-design user
study with 91 participants, we evaluate the effects of playful deception and
interaction duration on user experience. Results reveal that TIC-inspired
deception significantly enhances enjoyment and engagement, though reduces
perceived safety and trust, suggesting a structured trade-off across the
multi-dimensional aspects. Our findings demonstrate that playful deception can
be a valuable design strategy for interactive robots in entertainment and
engagement-focused contexts, while underscoring the importance of deliberate
consideration of its complex trade-offs. You can find more information,

Conclusion: 该多技能学习框架成功实现了四足机器人从专家演示中高效获取多样化运动技能的能力

Abstract: Despite growing interest in developing legged robots that emulate biological
locomotion for agile navigation of complex environments, acquiring a diverse
repertoire of skills remains a fundamental challenge in robotics. Existing
methods can learn motion behaviors from expert data, but they often fail to
acquire multiple locomotion skills through a single policy and lack smooth
skill transitions. We propose a multi-skill learning framework based on
Conditional Adversarial Motion Priors (CAMP), with the aim of enabling
quadruped robots to efficiently acquire a diverse set of locomotion skills from
expert demonstrations. Precise skill reconstruction is achieved through a novel
skill discriminator and skill-conditioned reward design. The overall framework
supports the active control and reuse of multiple skills, providing a practical
solution for learning generalizable policies in complex environments.

Abstract: Conventional maneuver prediction methods use some sort of classification
model on temporal trajectory data to predict behavior of agents over a set time
horizon. Despite of having the best precision and recall, these models cannot
predict a lane change accurately unless they incorporate information about the
entire scene. Level-k game theory can leverage the human-like hierarchical
reasoning to come up with the most rational decisions each agent can make in a
group. This can be leveraged to model interactions between different vehicles
in presence of each other and hence compute the most rational decisions each
agent would make. The result of game theoretic evaluation can be used as a
"prior" or combined with a traditional motion-based classification model to
achieve more accurate predictions. The proposed approach assumes that the
states of the vehicles around the target lead vehicle are known. The module
will output the most rational maneuver prediction of the target vehicle based
on an online optimization solution. These predictions are instrumental in
decision making systems like Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) or Traxen's
iQ-Cruise further improving the resulting fuel savings.

Abstract: Robotic manipulators capable of regulating both compliance and stiffness
offer enhanced operational safety and versatility. Here, we introduce Worm
Gear-based Adaptive Variable Elasticity (WAVE), a variable stiffness actuator
(VSA) that integrates a non-backdrivable worm gear. By decoupling the driving
motor from external forces using this gear, WAVE enables precise force
transmission to the joint, while absorbing positional discrepancies through
compliance. WAVE is protected from excessive loads by converting impact forces
into elastic energy stored in a spring. In addition, the actuator achieves
continuous joint stiffness modulation by changing the spring's precompression
length. We demonstrate these capabilities, experimentally validate the proposed
stiffness model, show that motor loads approach zero at rest--even under
external loading--and present applications using a manipulator with WAVE. This
outcome showcases the successful decoupling of external forces. The protective
attributes of this actuator allow for extended operation in contact-intensive
tasks, and for robust robotic applications in challenging environments.

Motivation: 解决长时域操作任务中的挑战，包括扩展动作序列和复杂对象交互，弥合高层符号规划与低层连续控制之间的鸿沟。

Method: 使用语义场景图作为场景状态的结构表示，包含基于场景图的任务规划器（使用VLM和LLM解析环境和推理场景状态转换序列）和解耦的结构化图像编辑管道（通过图像修复和合成将目标子目标图转换为对应图像）。

Result: 在多个长时域任务上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SAGE框架通过场景图有效连接了语义推理和像素级控制，为长时域操作任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Successfully solving long-horizon manipulation tasks remains a fundamental
challenge. These tasks involve extended action sequences and complex object
interactions, presenting a critical gap between high-level symbolic planning
and low-level continuous control. To bridge this gap, two essential
capabilities are required: robust long-horizon task planning and effective
goal-conditioned manipulation. Existing task planning methods, including
traditional and LLM-based approaches, often exhibit limited generalization or
sparse semantic reasoning. Meanwhile, image-conditioned control methods
struggle to adapt to unseen tasks. To tackle these problems, we propose SAGE, a
novel framework for Scene Graph-Aware Guidance and Execution in Long-Horizon
Manipulation Tasks. SAGE utilizes semantic scene graphs as a structural
representation for scene states. A structural scene graph enables bridging
task-level semantic reasoning and pixel-level visuo-motor control. This also
facilitates the controllable synthesis of accurate, novel sub-goal images. SAGE
consists of two key components: (1) a scene graph-based task planner that uses
VLMs and LLMs to parse the environment and reason about physically-grounded
scene state transition sequences, and (2) a decoupled structural image editing
pipeline that controllably converts each target sub-goal graph into a
corresponding image through image inpainting and composition. Extensive
experiments have demonstrated that SAGE achieves state-of-the-art performance
on distinct long-horizon tasks.

*Divake Kumar,Sina Tayebati,Francesco Migliarba,Ranganath Krishnan,Amit Ranjan Trivedi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出可学习一致性预测(LCP)，用轻量级神经网络替代固定非一致性分数，生成上下文感知的不确定性集合，在保持理论保证的同时显著减小预测集大小并提高机器人任务安全性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在机器人学中通常输出点估计且置信度校准不佳，无法量化新输入、噪声输入或分布外输入的预测可靠性。传统一致性预测依赖固定非一致性分数，忽略上下文信息，导致区间过于保守或不安全

Method: LCP使用轻量级神经网络函数替代固定非一致性分数，利用几何、语义和任务特定特征生成上下文感知的不确定性集合，保持一致性预测的理论保证

Result: 在分类任务中预测集大小减少18%，检测区间缩小52%，路径规划安全性从72%提升至91%。在7个基准测试的3个机器人任务中持续优于标准CP和集成基线方法

Conclusion: LCP是轻量级方法(4.8%运行时开销，42KB内存)，支持在线适应，适合资源受限的自主系统，在硬件评估中内存开销小于1%，推理开销15.9%，同时保持39FPS检测速度，比集成方法能效高7.4倍

Abstract: Deep learning models in robotics often output point estimates with poorly
calibrated confidences, offering no native mechanism to quantify predictive
reliability under novel, noisy, or out-of-distribution inputs. Conformal
prediction (CP) addresses this gap by providing distribution-free coverage
guarantees, yet its reliance on fixed nonconformity scores ignores context and
can yield intervals that are overly conservative or unsafe. We address this
with Learnable Conformal Prediction (LCP), which replaces fixed scores with a
lightweight neural function that leverages geometric, semantic, and
task-specific features to produce context-aware uncertainty sets.
  LCP maintains CP's theoretical guarantees while reducing prediction set sizes
by 18% in classification, tightening detection intervals by 52%, and improving
path planning safety from 72% to 91% success with minimal overhead. Across
three robotic tasks on seven benchmarks, LCP consistently outperforms Standard
CP and ensemble baselines. In classification on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, it
achieves smaller set sizes (4.7-9.9% reduction) at target coverage. For object
detection on COCO, BDD100K, and Cityscapes, it produces 46-54% tighter bounding
boxes. In path planning through cluttered environments, it improves success to
91.5% with only 4.5% path inflation, compared to 12.2% for Standard CP.
  The method is lightweight (approximately 4.8% runtime overhead, 42 KB memory)
and supports online adaptation, making it well suited to resource-constrained
autonomous systems. Hardware evaluation shows LCP adds less than 1% memory and
15.9% inference overhead, yet sustains 39 FPS on detection tasks while being
7.4 times more energy-efficient than ensembles.

TL;DR: FlowDrive是一个基于流匹配的轨迹规划器，通过条件修正流将噪声直接映射到轨迹分布，使用少量流匹配步骤。引入调节式闭环引导来增加轨迹多样性，在nuPlan和interPlan基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于学习的规划器对驾驶数据的长尾分布敏感，常见操作主导数据集，而危险或罕见场景稀疏。这种不平衡会使模型偏向频繁情况，在关键场景上性能下降。

Method: 比较训练数据采样平衡策略，发现按轨迹模式重新加权是有效方法。提出FlowDrive，学习条件修正流将噪声直接映射到轨迹分布。引入调节式闭环引导，在流步骤间注入小扰动来系统增加轨迹多样性。

Result: 在nuPlan和交互重点的interPlan基准测试中，FlowDrive在基于学习的规划器中达到最先进结果，接近带有基于规则优化的方法。添加调节式引导和轻量后处理后，在几乎所有基准测试分割上都达到整体最先进性能。

Conclusion: FlowDrive通过流匹配和调节式引导有效解决了数据不平衡问题，在轨迹规划任务中表现出色，特别是在处理长尾分布和增加轨迹多样性方面。

Abstract: Learning-based planners are sensitive to the long-tailed distribution of
driving data. Common maneuvers dominate datasets, while dangerous or rare
scenarios are sparse. This imbalance can bias models toward the frequent cases
and degrade performance on critical scenarios. To tackle this problem, we
compare balancing strategies for sampling training data and find reweighting by
trajectory pattern an effective approach. We then present FlowDrive, a
flow-matching trajectory planner that learns a conditional rectified flow to
map noise directly to trajectory distributions with few flow-matching steps. We
further introduce moderated, in-the-loop guidance that injects small
perturbation between flow steps to systematically increase trajectory diversity
while remaining scene-consistent. On nuPlan and the interaction-focused
interPlan benchmarks, FlowDrive achieves state-of-the-art results among
learning-based planners and approaches methods with rule-based refinements.
After adding moderated guidance and light post-processing (FlowDrive*), it
achieves overall state-of-the-art performance across nearly all benchmark
splits.

Result: 该方法显著优于基线方法，并支持基于部分或完整符号条件的灵活轨迹合成。

Conclusion: 混合扩散方法能够有效解决长时程机器人任务中的决策混淆问题，提升轨迹生成性能。

Abstract: Constructing robots to accomplish long-horizon tasks is a long-standing
challenge within artificial intelligence. Approaches using generative methods,
particularly Diffusion Models, have gained attention due to their ability to
model continuous robotic trajectories for planning and control. However, we
show that these models struggle with long-horizon tasks that involve complex
decision-making and, in general, are prone to confusing different modes of
behavior, leading to failure. To remedy this, we propose to augment continuous
trajectory generation by simultaneously generating a high-level symbolic plan.
We show that this requires a novel mix of discrete variable diffusion and
continuous diffusion, which dramatically outperforms the baselines. In
addition, we illustrate how this hybrid diffusion process enables flexible
trajectory synthesis, allowing us to condition synthesized actions on partial
and complete symbolic conditions.

TL;DR: 本文提出利用EgoScaler框架从原始第一人称视角视频中提取6DoF物体操作轨迹，构建大规模数据集用于视觉-语言-动作模型的预训练，实验证明该方法能显著提升任务成功率，且性能与真实机器人数据集相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统训练视觉-语言-动作模型依赖昂贵的人工远程操作，而第一人称视角视频提供了可扩展的替代方案，但以往方法需要额外的手部姿态标注，无法直接从原始视频训练。

Method: 使用EgoScaler框架从四个大规模第一人称视角视频数据集中提取6DoF物体操作轨迹，自动修正噪声或不完整的轨迹，构建预训练数据集。

Result: 在仿真和真实机器人环境中的实验表明：预训练使任务成功率提升超过20%；性能与真实机器人数据集相当；结合真实机器人数据可进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: 第一人称视角视频是推进视觉-语言-动作模型研究的有前景且可扩展的资源。

Abstract: Egocentric videos capture how humans manipulate objects and tools, providing
diverse motion cues for learning object manipulation. Unlike the costly,
expert-driven manual teleoperation commonly used in training
Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs), egocentric videos offer a scalable
alternative. However, prior studies that leverage such videos for training
robot policies typically rely on auxiliary annotations, such as detailed
hand-pose recordings. Consequently, it remains unclear whether VLAs can be
trained directly from raw egocentric videos. In this work, we address this
challenge by leveraging EgoScaler, a framework that extracts 6DoF object
manipulation trajectories from egocentric videos without requiring auxiliary
recordings. We apply EgoScaler to four large-scale egocentric video datasets
and automatically refine noisy or incomplete trajectories, thereby constructing
a new large-scale dataset for VLA pre-training. Our experiments with a
state-of-the-art $\pi_0$ architecture in both simulated and real-robot
environments yield three key findings: (i) pre-training on our dataset improves
task success rates by over 20\% compared to training from scratch, (ii) the
performance is competitive with that achieved using real-robot datasets, and
(iii) combining our dataset with real-robot data yields further improvements.
These results demonstrate that egocentric videos constitute a promising and
scalable resource for advancing VLA research.

Motivation: 虽然多自由度机器人肢体受自然启发，但单自由度设计具有简单性、鲁棒性、成本效益和效率等优势。多连杆和旋转关节的闭链机构能为1-DoF系统引入运动多样性，但通常受到全周期运动范围内自碰撞的限制。

Abstract: While it is expected to build robotic limbs with multiple degrees of freedom
(DoF) inspired by nature, a single DoF design remains fundamental, providing
benefits that include, but are not limited to, simplicity, robustness,
cost-effectiveness, and efficiency. Mechanisms, especially those with multiple
links and revolute joints connected in closed loops, play an enabling factor in
introducing motion diversity for 1-DoF systems, which are usually constrained
by self-collision during a full-cycle range of motion. This study presents a
novel computational approach to designing one-degree-of-freedom (1-DoF)
overconstrained robotic limbs for a desired spatial trajectory, while achieving
energy-efficient, self-collision-free motion in full-cycle rotations. Firstly,
we present the geometric optimization problem of linkage-based robotic limbs in
a generalized formulation for self-collision-free design. Next, we formulate
the spatial trajectory generation problem with the overconstrained linkages by
optimizing the similarity and dynamic-related metrics. We further optimize the
geometric shape of the overconstrained linkage to ensure smooth and
collision-free motion driven by a single actuator. We validated our proposed
method through various experiments, including personalized automata and
bio-inspired hexapod robots. The resulting hexapod robot, featuring
overconstrained robotic limbs, demonstrated outstanding energy efficiency
during forward walking.

Result: 在KITTI数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法优于现有方法，显著提高了LiDAR里程计的精度。

Conclusion: 提出的自适应ICP方法通过可靠的初始位姿和自适应阈值机制，有效解决了动态环境下的LiDAR里程计精度问题。

Abstract: As a key technology for autonomous navigation and positioning in mobile
robots, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) odometry is widely used in
autonomous driving applications. The Iterative Closest Point (ICP)-based
methods have become the core technique in LiDAR odometry due to their efficient
and accurate point cloud registration capability. However, some existing
ICP-based methods do not consider the reliability of the initial pose, which
may cause the method to converge to a local optimum. Furthermore, the absence
of an adaptive mechanism hinders the effective handling of complex dynamic
environments, resulting in a significant degradation of registration accuracy.
To address these issues, this paper proposes an adaptive ICP-based LiDAR
odometry method that relies on a reliable initial pose. First, distributed
coarse registration based on density filtering is employed to obtain the
initial pose estimation. The reliable initial pose is then selected by
comparing it with the motion prediction pose, reducing the initial error
between the source and target point clouds. Subsequently, by combining the
current and historical errors, the adaptive threshold is dynamically adjusted
to accommodate the real-time changes in the dynamic environment. Finally, based
on the reliable initial pose and the adaptive threshold, point-to-plane
adaptive ICP registration is performed from the current frame to the local map,
achieving high-precision alignment of the source and target point clouds.
Extensive experiments on the public KITTI dataset demonstrate that the proposed
method outperforms existing approaches and significantly enhances the accuracy
of LiDAR odometry.

Abstract: In-situ robotic exploration is an important tool for advancing knowledge of
geological processes that describe the Earth and other Planetary bodies. To
inform and enhance operations for these roving laboratories, it is imperative
to understand the terramechanical properties of their environments, especially
for traversing on loose, deformable substrates. Recent research suggested that
legged robots with direct-drive and low-gear ratio actuators can sensitively
detect external forces, and therefore possess the potential to measure terrain
properties with their legs during locomotion, providing unprecedented sampling
speed and density while accessing terrains previously too risky to sample. This
paper explores these ideas by investigating the impact of gait on
proprioceptive terrain sensing accuracy, particularly comparing a
sensing-oriented gait, Crawl N' Sense, with a locomotion-oriented gait,
Trot-Walk. Each gait's ability to measure the strength and texture of
deformable substrate is quantified as the robot locomotes over a laboratory
transect consisting of a rigid surface, loose sand, and loose sand with
synthetic surface crusts. Our results suggest that with both the
sensing-oriented crawling gait and locomotion-oriented trot gait, the robot can
measure a consistent difference in the strength (in terms of penetration
resistance) between the low- and high-resistance substrates; however, the
locomotion-oriented trot gait contains larger magnitude and variance in
measurements. Furthermore, the slower crawl gait can detect brittle ruptures of
the surface crusts with significantly higher accuracy than the faster trot
gait. Our results offer new insights that inform legged robot "sensing during
locomotion" gait design and planning for scouting the terrain and producing
scientific measurements on other worlds to advance our understanding of their
geology and formation.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation with Vision-Language-Action models requires efficient
inference over long-horizon multi-modal context, where attention to dense
visual tokens dominates computational cost. Existing methods optimize inference
speed by reducing visual redundancy within VLA models, but they overlook the
varying redundancy across robotic manipulation stages. We observe that the
visual token redundancy is higher in coarse manipulation phase than in
fine-grained operations, and is strongly correlated with the action dynamic.
Motivated by this observation, we propose \textbf{A}ction-aware
\textbf{D}ynamic \textbf{P}runing (\textbf{ADP}), a multi-modal pruning
framework that integrates text-driven token selection with action-aware
trajectory gating. Our method introduces a gating mechanism that conditions the
pruning signal on recent action trajectories, using past motion windows to
adaptively adjust token retention ratios in accordance with dynamics, thereby
balancing computational efficiency and perceptual precision across different
manipulation stages. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO suites and diverse
real-world scenarios demonstrate that our method significantly reduces FLOPs
and action inference latency (\textit{e.g.} $1.35 \times$ speed up on
OpenVLA-OFT) while maintaining competitive success rates (\textit{e.g.} 25.8\%
improvements with OpenVLA) compared to baselines, thereby providing a simple
plug-in path to efficient robot policies that advances the efficiency and
performance frontier of robotic manipulation. Our project website is:

Result: 仿真和实验测试表明，该方法显著提高了鲁棒性，优于非鲁棒NMPC。在2kg未知负载和外部扰动下，多阶段NMPC的大腿和小腿交互力的RMS值分别比非鲁棒NMPC降低了77%和94%。

Conclusion: 多阶段NMPC方法能够有效处理外骨骼机器人系统中的不确定性，显著降低跟踪误差和交互力，为外骨骼控制提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: The use of exoskeleton robots is increasing due to the rising number of
musculoskeletal injuries. However, their effectiveness depends heavily on the
design of control systems. Designing robust controllers is challenging because
of uncertainties in human-robot systems. Among various control strategies,
Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a powerful approach due to its ability to
handle constraints and optimize performance. Previous studies have used
linearization-based methods to implement robust MPC on exoskeletons, but these
can degrade performance due to nonlinearities in the robot's dynamics. To
address this gap, this paper proposes a Robust Nonlinear Model Predictive
Control (RNMPC) method, called multi-stage NMPC, to control a
two-degree-of-freedom exoskeleton by solving a nonlinear optimization problem.
This method uses multiple scenarios to represent system uncertainties. The
study focuses on minimizing human-robot interaction forces during the swing
phase, particularly when the robot carries unknown loads. Simulations and
experimental tests show that the proposed method significantly improves
robustness, outperforming non-robust NMPC. It achieves lower tracking errors
and interaction forces under various uncertainties. For instance, when a 2 kg
unknown payload is combined with external disturbances, the RMS values of thigh
and shank interaction forces for multi-stage NMPC are reduced by 77 and 94
percent, respectively, compared to non-robust NMPC.

Motivation: 解决多指灵巧手通用抓取中的高维长时域探索难题，避免复杂奖励和课程设计导致的次优解。

Conclusion: DemoGrasp展示了强大的泛化能力，能够适应空间、背景和光照变化，支持RGB和深度输入，并可扩展到语言引导的杂乱场景抓取。

Abstract: Universal grasping with multi-fingered dexterous hands is a fundamental
challenge in robotic manipulation. While recent approaches successfully learn
closed-loop grasping policies using reinforcement learning (RL), the inherent
difficulty of high-dimensional, long-horizon exploration necessitates complex
reward and curriculum design, often resulting in suboptimal solutions across
diverse objects. We propose DemoGrasp, a simple yet effective method for
learning universal dexterous grasping. We start from a single successful
demonstration trajectory of grasping a specific object and adapt to novel
objects and poses by editing the robot actions in this trajectory: changing the
wrist pose determines where to grasp, and changing the hand joint angles
determines how to grasp. We formulate this trajectory editing as a single-step
Markov Decision Process (MDP) and use RL to optimize a universal policy across
hundreds of objects in parallel in simulation, with a simple reward consisting
of a binary success term and a robot-table collision penalty. In simulation,
DemoGrasp achieves a 95% success rate on DexGraspNet objects using the Shadow
Hand, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods. It also shows strong
transferability, achieving an average success rate of 84.6% across diverse
dexterous hand embodiments on six unseen object datasets, while being trained
on only 175 objects. Through vision-based imitation learning, our policy
successfully grasps 110 unseen real-world objects, including small, thin items.
It generalizes to spatial, background, and lighting changes, supports both RGB
and depth inputs, and extends to language-guided grasping in cluttered scenes.

Abstract: Learning to generate dual-hand grasps that respect object semantics is
essential for robust hand-object interaction but remains largely underexplored
due to dataset scarcity. Existing grasp datasets predominantly focus on
single-hand interactions and contain only limited semantic part annotations. To
address these challenges, we introduce a pipeline, SymOpt, that constructs a
large-scale dual-hand grasp dataset by leveraging existing single-hand datasets
and exploiting object and hand symmetries. Building on this, we propose a
text-guided dual-hand grasp generator, DHAGrasp, that synthesizes Dual-Hand
Affordance-aware Grasps for unseen objects. Our approach incorporates a novel
dual-hand affordance representation and follows a two-stage design, which
enables effective learning from a small set of segmented training objects while
scaling to a much larger pool of unsegmented data. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method produces diverse and semantically consistent
grasps, outperforming strong baselines in both grasp quality and generalization
to unseen objects. The project page is at

TL;DR: VLM2VLA是一种新的视觉语言动作模型训练范式，通过将低级动作表示为自然语言来解决数据分布不匹配问题，使用LoRA微调避免灾难性遗忘，保持VLM的核心推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于视觉语言模型微调的方法存在灾难性遗忘问题，导致模型在机器人任务中失去原有的多模态理解和推理能力，限制了泛化到新场景的能力。

Method: 将低级动作表示为自然语言以对齐数据分布，然后仅使用LoRA对VLM进行微调，最小化对主干网络的修改。

Result: 通过800多次真实机器人实验和视觉问答研究，证明VLM2VLA能保持VLM核心能力，实现零样本泛化到需要开放世界语义推理和多语言指令跟随的新任务。

Conclusion: VLM2VLA通过数据级对齐和最小化模型修改，成功解决了VLA训练中的灾难性遗忘问题，为通用策略训练提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) on robot teleoperation data to
create vision-language-action (VLA) models is a promising paradigm for training
generalist policies, but it suffers from a fundamental tradeoff: learning to
produce actions often diminishes the VLM's foundational reasoning and
multimodal understanding, hindering generalization to novel scenarios,
instruction following, and semantic understanding. We argue that this
catastrophic forgetting is due to a distribution mismatch between the VLM's
internet-scale pretraining corpus and the robotics fine-tuning data. Inspired
by this observation, we introduce VLM2VLA: a VLA training paradigm that first
resolves this mismatch at the data level by representing low-level actions with
natural language. This alignment makes it possible to train VLAs solely with
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), thereby minimally modifying the VLM backbone and
averting catastrophic forgetting. As a result, the VLM can be fine-tuned on
robot teleoperation data without fundamentally altering the underlying
architecture and without expensive co-training on internet-scale VLM datasets.
Through extensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) studies and over 800
real-world robotics experiments, we demonstrate that VLM2VLA preserves the
VLM's core capabilities, enabling zero-shot generalization to novel tasks that
require open-world semantic reasoning and multilingual instruction following.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 收集机器人交互数据成本高昂，而人类演示视频更易获取且成本效益高，但存在人类视频与机器人执行视频之间的领域差距问题。

Method: 提出MimicDreamer框架，包含H2R Aligner进行视觉对齐，EgoStabilizer进行视角稳定化，以及动作对齐模块将人手轨迹映射到机器人坐标系。

Result: 仅使用合成的人类到机器人视频训练的VLA模型能在真实机器人上实现少样本执行，相比仅使用真实机器人数据训练的模型，在六个代表性操作任务中平均成功率提升14.7%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效弥合了人类演示与机器人执行之间的领域差距，通过可扩展的人类数据显著提升了VLA模型的性能。

Abstract: Vision Language Action (VLA) models derive their generalization capability
from diverse training data, yet collecting embodied robot interaction data
remains prohibitively expensive. In contrast, human demonstration videos are
far more scalable and cost-efficient to collect, and recent studies confirm
their effectiveness in training VLA models. However, a significant domain gap
persists between human videos and robot-executed videos, including unstable
camera viewpoints, visual discrepancies between human hands and robotic arms,
and differences in motion dynamics. To bridge this gap, we propose
MimicDreamer, a framework that turns fast, low-cost human demonstrations into
robot-usable supervision by jointly aligning vision, viewpoint, and actions to
directly support policy training. For visual alignment, we propose H2R Aligner,
a video diffusion model that generates high-fidelity robot demonstration videos
by transferring motion from human manipulation footage. For viewpoint
stabilization, EgoStabilizer is proposed, which canonicalizes egocentric videos
via homography and inpaints occlusions and distortions caused by warping. For
action alignment, we map human hand trajectories to the robot frame and apply a
constrained inverse kinematics solver to produce feasible, low-jitter joint
commands with accurate pose tracking. Empirically, VLA models trained purely on
our synthesized human-to-robot videos achieve few-shot execution on real
robots. Moreover, scaling training with human data significantly boosts
performance compared to models trained solely on real robot data; our approach
improves the average success rate by 14.7\% across six representative
manipulation tasks.

Motivation: 解决零样本设置下机器人泛化到长视野操作任务的核心挑战，当前多模态基础方法仅从静态视觉输入无法将高级命令分解为可执行动作序列。

Method: 分层框架包含两个顺序模块：1）人类意图翻译器（HIT）通过多模态推理解析输入视频，生成语言基础子任务序列；2）未来动态预测器（FDP）使用生成模型为每个步骤合成物理上合理的视频展开。

Result: 在长视野操作任务套件上的广泛实验表明，Super-Mimic显著优于最先进的零样本方法，性能提升超过20%。

Conclusion: 将视频驱动的意图解析与前瞻性动态建模相结合，是开发通用机器人系统的有效策略。

Abstract: Generalizing to long-horizon manipulation tasks in a zero-shot setting
remains a central challenge in robotics. Current multimodal foundation based
approaches, despite their capabilities, typically fail to decompose high-level
commands into executable action sequences from static visual input alone. To
address this challenge, we introduce Super-Mimic, a hierarchical framework that
enables zero-shot robotic imitation by directly inferring procedural intent
from unscripted human demonstration videos. Our framework is composed of two
sequential modules. First, a Human Intent Translator (HIT) parses the input
video using multimodal reasoning to produce a sequence of language-grounded
subtasks. These subtasks then condition a Future Dynamics Predictor (FDP),
which employs a generative model that synthesizes a physically plausible video
rollout for each step. The resulting visual trajectories are dynamics-aware,
explicitly modeling crucial object interactions and contact points to guide the
low-level controller. We validate this approach through extensive experiments
on a suite of long-horizon manipulation tasks, where Super-Mimic significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot methods by over 20\%. These results
establish that coupling video-driven intent parsing with prospective dynamics
modeling is a highly effective strategy for developing general-purpose robotic
systems.

Motivation: 有语言障碍的学龄前儿童需要语言支持，但传统方法要求专业人士具备精确的语言知识和实时生成能力，这对教育者和家长来说负担较重。

Method: 使用Furhat对话机器人通过单词检索游戏"Alias"与儿童互动，利用大型语言模型管理游戏流程、对话、情感响应和轮换。

Result: 目前系统已能管理游戏交互，下一步将增强LLM能力以在游戏中生成和传递特定的语言形态目标。

Conclusion: 机器人可能在此任务上优于人类，长期目标是创建基于LLM的机器人辅助语言学习干预系统，能够教授多种语言的形态结构。

Abstract: Preschool children with language vulnerabilities -- such as developmental
language disorders or immigration related language challenges -- often require
support to strengthen their expressive language skills. Based on the principle
of implicit learning, speech-language therapists (SLTs) typically embed target
morphological structures (e.g., third person -s) into everyday interactions or
game-based learning activities. Educators are recommended by SLTs to do the
same. This approach demands precise linguistic knowledge and real-time
production of various morphological forms (e.g., "Daddy wears these when he
drives to work"). The task becomes even more demanding when educators or parent
also must keep children engaged and manage turn-taking in a game-based
activity. In the TalBot project our multiprofessional team have developed an
application in which the Furhat conversational robot plays the word retrieval
game "Alias" with children to improve language skills. Our application
currently employs a large language model (LLM) to manage gameplay, dialogue,
affective responses, and turn-taking. Our next step is to further leverage the
capacity of LLMs so the robot can generate and deliver specific morphological
targets during the game. We hypothesize that a robot could outperform humans at
this task. Novel aspects of this approach are that the robot could ultimately
serve as a model and tutor for both children and professionals and that using
LLM capabilities in this context would support basic communication needs for
children with language vulnerabilities. Our long-term goal is to create a
robust LLM-based Robot-Assisted Language Learning intervention capable of
teaching a variety of morphological structures across different languages.

Motivation: 传统固定滞后雷达-LiDAR-惯性平滑器为每个测量创建一个因子图节点，导致状态创建率翻倍，计算成本高，难以在资源受限硬件上实现实时性能。

Method: 使用IMU预积分雷达因子，利用高频惯性数据将最近的LiDAR状态传播到雷达测量时间戳，从而将节点创建率保持在LiDAR测量频率。

Result: 在单板计算机上的实验表明，该方法保持了传统基线的绝对姿态误差，同时将聚合因子图优化时间降低了56%。

Conclusion: 提出的IMU预积分雷达因子方法有效降低了计算成本，在保持定位精度的同时显著提升了实时性能。

Abstract: Fixed-lag Radar-LiDAR-Inertial smoothers conventionally create one factor
graph node per measurement to compensate for the lack of time synchronization
between radar and LiDAR. For a radar-LiDAR sensor pair with equal rates, this
strategy results in a state creation rate of twice the individual sensor
frequencies. This doubling of the number of states per second yields high
optimization costs, inhibiting real-time performance on resource-constrained
hardware. We introduce IMU-preintegrated radar factors that use high-rate
inertial data to propagate the most recent LiDAR state to the radar measurement
timestamp. This strategy maintains the node creation rate at the LiDAR
measurement frequency. Assuming equal sensor rates, this lowers the number of
nodes by 50 % and consequently the computational costs. Experiments on a single
board computer (which has 4 cores each of 2.2 GHz A73 and 2 GHz A53 with 8 GB
RAM) show that our method preserves the absolute pose error of a conventional
baseline while simultaneously lowering the aggregated factor graph optimization
time by up to 56 %.

Abstract: Hospital patient falls remain a critical and costly challenge worldwide.
While conventional fall prevention systems typically rely on post-fall
detection or reactive alerts, they also often suffer from high false positive
rates and fail to address the underlying patient needs that lead to bed-exit
attempts. This paper presents a novel system architecture that leverages the
Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT) to orchestrate human-robot-robot interaction
for proactive and personalized patient assistance. The system integrates a
privacy-preserving thermal sensing model capable of real-time bed-exit
prediction, with two coordinated robotic agents that respond dynamically based
on predicted intent and patient input. This orchestrated response could not
only reduce fall risk but also attend to the patient's underlying motivations
for movement, such as thirst, discomfort, or the need for assistance, before a
hazardous situation arises. Our contributions with this pilot study are
three-fold: (1) a modular IoRT-based framework enabling distributed sensing,
prediction, and multi-robot coordination; (2) a demonstration of low-resolution
thermal sensing for accurate, privacy-preserving preemptive bed-exit detection;
and (3) results from a user study and systematic error analysis that inform the
design of situationally aware, multi-agent interactions in hospital settings.
The findings highlight how interactive and connected robotic systems can move
beyond passive monitoring to deliver timely, meaningful assistance, empowering
safer, more responsive care environments.

Result: 评估发现：(i)所有智能体都表现出显著视觉偏见，相机视角是最关键因素；(ii)智能体在高度饱和颜色上成功率最高，表明继承了底层VLM的视觉偏好；(iii)视觉偏见表现出强不对称耦合，视角强烈放大了颜色相关偏见。

Conclusion: 系统分析视觉偏见是开发安全可靠通用具身智能体的先决条件，基于语义接地层的缓解策略能显著减少视觉偏见。

Abstract: The safety and reliability of embodied agents rely on accurate and unbiased
visual perception. However, existing benchmarks mainly emphasize generalization
and robustness under perturbations, while systematic quantification of visual
bias remains scarce. This gap limits a deeper understanding of how perception
influences decision-making stability. To address this issue, we propose
RoboView-Bias, the first benchmark specifically designed to systematically
quantify visual bias in robotic manipulation, following a principle of factor
isolation. Leveraging a structured variant-generation framework and a
perceptual-fairness validation protocol, we create 2,127 task instances that
enable robust measurement of biases induced by individual visual factors and
their interactions. Using this benchmark, we systematically evaluate three
representative embodied agents across two prevailing paradigms and report three
key findings: (i) all agents exhibit significant visual biases, with camera
viewpoint being the most critical factor; (ii) agents achieve their highest
success rates on highly saturated colors, indicating inherited visual
preferences from underlying VLMs; and (iii) visual biases show strong,
asymmetric coupling, with viewpoint strongly amplifying color-related bias.
Finally, we demonstrate that a mitigation strategy based on a semantic
grounding layer substantially reduces visual bias by approximately 54.5\% on
MOKA. Our results highlight that systematic analysis of visual bias is a
prerequisite for developing safe and reliable general-purpose embodied agents.

Conclusion: 结合触觉感知和学习型多智能体MPC，为复杂环境中的协作抓取提供了鲁棒、智能的解决方案，显著提升了多智能体系统的能力。

Abstract: Grasping is a core task in robotics with various applications. However, most
current implementations are primarily designed for rigid items, and their
performance drops considerably when handling fragile or deformable materials
that require real-time feedback. Meanwhile, tactile-reactive grasping focuses
on a single agent, which limits their ability to grasp and manipulate large,
heavy objects. To overcome this, we propose a learning-based, tactile-reactive
multi-agent Model Predictive Controller (MPC) for grasping a wide range of
objects with different softness and shapes, beyond the capabilities of
preexisting single-agent implementations. Our system uses two Gelsight Mini
tactile sensors [1] to extract real-time information on object texture and
stiffness. This rich tactile feedback is used to estimate contact dynamics and
object compliance in real time, enabling the system to adapt its control policy
to diverse object geometries and stiffness profiles. The learned controller
operates in a closed loop, leveraging tactile encoding to predict grasp
stability and adjust force and position accordingly. Our key technical
contributions include a multi-agent MPC formulation trained on real contact
interactions, a tactile-data driven method for inferring grasping states, and a
coordination strategy that enables collaborative control. By combining tactile
sensing and a learning-based multi-agent MPC, our method offers a robust,
intelligent solution for collaborative grasping in complex environments,
significantly advancing the capabilities of multi-agent systems. Our approach
is validated through extensive experiments against independent PD and MPC
baselines. Our pipeline outperforms the baselines regarding success rates in
achieving and maintaining stable grasps across objects of varying sizes and
stiffness.

Abstract: Personal service robots are increasingly used in domestic settings to assist
older adults and people requiring support. Effective operation involves not
only physical interaction but also the ability to interpret dynamic
environments, understand tasks, and choose appropriate actions based on
context. This requires integrating both hardware components (e.g. sensors,
actuators) and software systems capable of reasoning about tasks, environments,
and robot capabilities. Frameworks such as the Robot Operating System (ROS)
provide open-source tools that help connect low-level hardware with
higher-level functionalities. However, real-world deployments remain tightly
coupled to specific platforms. As a result, solutions are often isolated and
hard-coded, limiting interoperability, reusability, and knowledge sharing.
Ontologies and knowledge graphs offer a structured way to represent tasks,
environments, and robot capabilities. Existing ontologies, such as the
Socio-physical Model of Activities (SOMA) and the Descriptive Ontology for
Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering (DOLCE), provide models for activities,
spatial relationships, and reasoning structures. However, they often focus on
specific domains and do not fully capture the connection between environment,
action, robot capabilities, and system-level integration. In this work, we
propose the Ontology for roBOts and acTions (OntoBOT), which extends existing
ontologies to provide a unified representation of tasks, actions, environments,
and capabilities. Our contributions are twofold: (1) we unify these aspects
into a cohesive ontology to support formal reasoning about task execution, and
(2) we demonstrate its generalizability by evaluating competency questions
across four embodied agents - TIAGo, HSR, UR3, and Stretch - showing how
OntoBOT enables context-aware reasoning, task-oriented execution, and knowledge
sharing in service robotics.

Abstract: This paper presents UnderwaterVLA, a novel framework for autonomous
underwater navigation that integrates multimodal foundation models with
embodied intelligence systems. Underwater operations remain difficult due to
hydrodynamic disturbances, limited communication bandwidth, and degraded
sensing in turbid waters. To address these challenges, we introduce three
innovations. First, a dual-brain architecture decouples high-level mission
reasoning from low-level reactive control, enabling robust operation under
communication and computational constraints. Second, we apply
Vision-Language-Action(VLA) models to underwater robotics for the first time,
incorporating structured chain-of-thought reasoning for interpretable
decision-making. Third, a hydrodynamics-informed Model Predictive Control(MPC)
scheme compensates for fluid effects in real time without costly task-specific
training. Experimental results in field tests show that UnderwaterVLA reduces
navigation errors in degraded visual conditions while maintaining higher task
completion by 19% to 27% over baseline. By minimizing reliance on
underwater-specific training data and improving adaptability across
environments, UnderwaterVLA provides a scalable and cost-effective path toward
the next generation of intelligent AUVs.

Conclusion: 提出的算法能够有效处理异构机器人团队在不确定任务需求环境中的任务分配问题，通过耦合奖励建模实现更好的团队协作性能。

Abstract: This paper proposes a task allocation algorithm for teams of heterogeneous
robots in environments with uncertain task requirements. We model these
requirements as probability distributions over capabilities and use this model
to allocate tasks such that robots with complementary skills naturally position
near uncertain tasks, proactively mitigating task failures without wasting
resources. We introduce a market-based approach that optimizes the joint team
objective while explicitly capturing coupled rewards between robots, offering a
polynomial-time solution in decentralized settings with strict communication
assumptions. Comparative experiments against benchmark algorithms demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach and highlight the challenges of incorporating
coupled rewards in a decentralized formulation.

Abstract: Mutual understanding of artificial agents' decisions is key to ensuring a
trustworthy and successful human-robot interaction. Hence, robots are expected
to make reasonable decisions and communicate them to humans when needed. In
this article, the focus is on an approach to modeling and reasoning about the
comparison of two competing plans, so that robots can later explain the
divergent result. First, a novel ontological model is proposed to formalize and
reason about the differences between competing plans, enabling the
classification of the most appropriate one (e.g., the shortest, the safest, the
closest to human preferences, etc.). This work also investigates the
limitations of a baseline algorithm for ontology-based explanatory narration.
To address these limitations, a novel algorithm is presented, leveraging
divergent knowledge between plans and facilitating the construction of
contrastive narratives. Through empirical evaluation, it is observed that the
explanations excel beyond the baseline method.

TL;DR: HELIOS是一个分层场景表示方法，用于解决语言指定的移动操作任务，在部分观察场景中平衡探索与利用，在OVMM基准测试中达到最先进水平，并能零样本迁移到真实世界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在部分观察的新环境中执行语言指定移动操作任务时面临的挑战：场景部分观察、语言指令到部分观察场景的语义信息落地、以及主动更新场景知识。

Method: 构建包含相关语义和占据信息的2D地图，同时主动构建任务相关对象的3D高斯表示，融合多层表示中的观察结果，显式建模每个对象检测的多视角一致性，并制定平衡未观察区域探索和场景语义信息利用的目标函数。

Result: 在Habitat模拟器的OVMM基准测试中取得最先进结果，由于是零样本方法，HELIOS还能无需额外数据迁移到真实世界，在Spot机器人上成功演示。

Conclusion: HELIOS通过分层场景表示和搜索目标有效解决了语言指定移动操作任务中的挑战，在模拟和真实环境中都表现出色。

Abstract: Language-specified mobile manipulation tasks in novel environments
simultaneously face challenges interacting with a scene which is only partially
observed, grounding semantic information from language instructions to the
partially observed scene, and actively updating knowledge of the scene with new
observations. To address these challenges, we propose HELIOS, a hierarchical
scene representation and associated search objective to perform language
specified pick and place mobile manipulation tasks. We construct 2D maps
containing the relevant semantic and occupancy information for navigation while
simultaneously actively constructing 3D Gaussian representations of
task-relevant objects. We fuse observations across this multi-layered
representation while explicitly modeling the multi-view consistency of the
detections of each object. In order to efficiently search for the target
object, we formulate an objective function balancing exploration of unobserved
or uncertain regions with exploitation of scene semantic information. We
evaluate HELIOS on the OVMM benchmark in the Habitat simulator, a pick and
place benchmark in which perception is challenging due to large and complex
scenes with comparatively small target objects. HELIOS achieves
state-of-the-art results on OVMM. As our approach is zero-shot, HELIOS can also
transfer to the real world without requiring additional data, as we illustrate
by demonstrating it in a real world office environment on a Spot robot.

TL;DR: 提出了一种意图驱动的车道变换框架，通过驾驶风格识别、合作感知决策和协调运动规划，在混合交通环境中实现安全高效的车道变换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自动驾驶车辆与人类驾驶车辆混合的交通环境中，不可预测的意图和异质行为使得安全高效的车道变换极具挑战性，现有方法往往过度简化这些交互。

Method: 使用深度学习分类器实时识别人类驾驶风格，通过合作评分估计周围驾驶员的意图和合作意愿，结合行为克隆和逆强化学习进行决策，集成模型预测控制和IRL意图推断生成轨迹。

Result: 实验显示该模型达到94.2%准确率和94.3% F1分数，在车道变换识别上比基于规则和学习的方法提升4-15%。

Conclusion: 结果表明建模驾驶员异质性的益处，展示了该框架在复杂交通环境中推进情境感知和类人自动驾驶的潜力。

Abstract: In mixed-traffic environments, where autonomous vehicles (AVs) interact with
diverse human-driven vehicles (HVs), unpredictable intentions and heterogeneous
behaviors make safe and efficient lane change maneuvers highly challenging.
Existing methods often oversimplify these interactions by assuming uniform
patterns. We propose an intention-driven lane change framework that integrates
driving-style recognition, cooperation-aware decision-making, and coordinated
motion planning. A deep learning classifier trained on the NGSIM dataset
identifies human driving styles in real time. A cooperation score with
intrinsic and interactive components estimates surrounding drivers' intentions
and quantifies their willingness to cooperate with the ego vehicle.
Decision-making combines behavior cloning with inverse reinforcement learning
to determine whether a lane change should be initiated. For trajectory
generation, model predictive control is integrated with IRL-based intention
inference to produce collision-free and socially compliant maneuvers.
Experiments show that the proposed model achieves 94.2\% accuracy and 94.3\%
F1-score, outperforming rule-based and learning-based baselines by 4-15\% in
lane change recognition. These results highlight the benefit of modeling
inter-driver heterogeneity and demonstrate the potential of the framework to
advance context-aware and human-like autonomous driving in complex traffic
environments.

Conclusion: 该方法在仅使用RGB输入的情况下实现了最先进的性能，解决了类别不平衡问题，并公开发布了带有帧级标注的新数据集以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Efficiently detecting human intent to interact with ubiquitous robots is
crucial for effective human-robot interaction (HRI) and collaboration. Over the
past decade, deep learning has gained traction in this field, with most
existing approaches relying on multimodal inputs, such as RGB combined with
depth (RGB-D), to classify time-sequence windows of sensory data as interactive
or non-interactive. In contrast, we propose a novel RGB-only pipeline for
predicting human interaction intent with frame-level precision, enabling faster
robot responses and improved service quality. A key challenge in intent
prediction is the class imbalance inherent in real-world HRI datasets, which
can hinder the model's training and generalization. To address this, we
introduce MINT-RVAE, a synthetic sequence generation method, along with new
loss functions and training strategies that enhance generalization on
out-of-sample data. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance (AUROC:
0.95) outperforming prior works (AUROC: 0.90-0.912), while requiring only RGB
input and supporting precise frame onset prediction. Finally, to support future
research, we openly release our new dataset with frame-level labeling of human
interaction intent.

Motivation: 模仿学习策略在机器人操作中表现良好，但在单一自我中心视角训练下，当面对自我中心视角变化时性能会下降。

Method: 提出EgoDemoGen框架，通过在新自我中心帧中重新定位动作，并使用生成视频修复模型EgoViewTransfer合成对应的自我中心观察视频。EgoViewTransfer基于预训练视频生成模型，采用自监督双重重投影策略进行微调。

Result: 在仿真中，使用EgoDemoGen生成的新自我中心演示和原始标准自我中心演示混合训练后，策略在标准自我中心视角下的成功率绝对提升+17.0%，在新颖自我中心视角下提升+17.7%。在真实机器人上，绝对改进分别为+18.3%和+25.8%。

Conclusion: EgoDemoGen为实现自我中心视角鲁棒的机器人操作提供了一条实用途径，且随着EgoDemoGen生成演示比例的增加，性能持续提升（收益递减）。

Abstract: Imitation learning based policies perform well in robotic manipulation, but
they often degrade under *egocentric viewpoint shifts* when trained from a
single egocentric viewpoint. To address this issue, we present **EgoDemoGen**,
a framework that generates *paired* novel egocentric demonstrations by
retargeting actions in the novel egocentric frame and synthesizing the
corresponding egocentric observation videos with proposed generative video
repair model **EgoViewTransfer**, which is conditioned by a novel-viewpoint
reprojected scene video and a robot-only video rendered from the retargeted
joint actions. EgoViewTransfer is finetuned from a pretrained video generation
model using self-supervised double reprojection strategy. We evaluate
EgoDemoGen on both simulation (RoboTwin2.0) and real-world robot. After
training with a mixture of EgoDemoGen-generated novel egocentric demonstrations
and original standard egocentric demonstrations, policy success rate improves
**absolutely** by **+17.0%** for standard egocentric viewpoint and by
**+17.7%** for novel egocentric viewpoints in simulation. On real-world robot,
the **absolute** improvements are **+18.3%** and **+25.8%**. Moreover,
performance continues to improve as the proportion of EgoDemoGen-generated
demonstrations increases, with diminishing returns. These results demonstrate
that EgoDemoGen provides a practical route to egocentric viewpoint-robust
robotic manipulation.

TL;DR: WoW是一个140亿参数的世界模型，通过200万机器人交互轨迹训练，证明大规模真实世界交互是发展AI物理直觉的关键。该模型能通过SOPHIA系统约束物理真实性，并在WoWBench基准测试中达到最先进的物理一致性表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频模型（如Sora）仅通过被动观察学习，难以理解物理因果关系。作者假设真实的物理直觉必须基于与真实世界的大量因果丰富交互。

Method: 开发14B参数的WoW生成世界模型，在200万机器人交互轨迹上训练。使用SOPHIA系统通过视觉语言模型评估DiT生成输出并迭代优化语言指令，同时通过共训练的反向动力学模型将精炼计划转化为可执行机器人动作。

Result: 模型对物理的理解是可能结果的概率分布，会产生随机不稳定性和物理幻觉。在WoWBench基准测试中，WoW在物理一致性、碰撞动力学和物体持久性方面表现出色，在人类和自动评估中均达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: 大规模真实世界交互是发展AI物理直觉的基石。通过交互式训练的世界模型能够更好地理解物理因果关系，并为从想象到行动的闭环系统提供基础。

Abstract: Humans develop an understanding of intuitive physics through active
interaction with the world. This approach is in stark contrast to current video
models, such as Sora, which rely on passive observation and therefore struggle
with grasping physical causality. This observation leads to our central
hypothesis: authentic physical intuition of the world model must be grounded in
extensive, causally rich interactions with the real world. To test this
hypothesis, we present WoW, a 14-billion-parameter generative world model
trained on 2 million robot interaction trajectories. Our findings reveal that
the model's understanding of physics is a probabilistic distribution of
plausible outcomes, leading to stochastic instabilities and physical
hallucinations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this emergent capability can
be actively constrained toward physical realism by SOPHIA, where
vision-language model agents evaluate the DiT-generated output and guide its
refinement by iteratively evolving the language instructions. In addition, a
co-trained Inverse Dynamics Model translates these refined plans into
executable robotic actions, thus closing the imagination-to-action loop. We
establish WoWBench, a new benchmark focused on physical consistency and causal
reasoning in video, where WoW achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
human and autonomous evaluation, demonstrating strong ability in physical
causality, collision dynamics, and object permanence. Our work provides
systematic evidence that large-scale, real-world interaction is a cornerstone
for developing physical intuition in AI. Models, data, and benchmarks will be
open-sourced.

Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言-动作模型在通用机器人操作任务中表现出色，但仅限于预测短视的下一步动作，在长时程轨迹任务中因增量偏差而表现不佳。

Method: 提出VLA-Reasoner框架，通过世界模型采样和展开可能的动作轨迹来生成未来状态，利用蒙特卡洛树搜索提高搜索效率，引入基于核密度估计的置信度采样机制，并通过离线奖励塑形策略评估中间状态。

Result: 在模拟器和真实世界中的广泛实验表明，VLA-Reasoner相比最先进的VLA模型取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: 该方法为机器人操作的可扩展测试时计算指明了一条潜在路径。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) achieve strong performance in general
robotic manipulation tasks by scaling imitation learning. However, existing
VLAs are limited to predicting short-sighted next-action, which struggle with
long-horizon trajectory tasks due to incremental deviations. To address this
problem, we propose a plug-in framework named VLA-Reasoner that effectively
empowers off-the-shelf VLAs with the capability of foreseeing future states via
test-time scaling. Specifically, VLA-Reasoner samples and rolls out possible
action trajectories where involved actions are rationales to generate future
states via a world model, which enables VLA-Reasoner to foresee and reason
potential outcomes and search for the optimal actions. We further leverage
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to improve search efficiency in large action
spaces, where stepwise VLA predictions seed the root. Meanwhile, we introduce a
confidence sampling mechanism based on Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), to
enable efficient exploration in MCTS without redundant VLA queries. We evaluate
intermediate states in MCTS via an offline reward shaping strategy, to score
predicted futures and correct deviations with long-term feedback. We conducted
extensive experiments in both simulators and the real world, demonstrating that
our proposed VLA-Reasoner achieves significant improvements over the
state-of-the-art VLAs. Our method highlights a potential pathway toward
scalable test-time computation of robotic manipulation.

Abstract: We present DAWN (Diffusion is All We Need for robot control), a unified
diffusion-based framework for language-conditioned robotic manipulation that
bridges high-level motion intent and low-level robot action via structured

end-to-end system with interpretable intermediate motion abstractions. DAWN
achieves state-of-the-art results on the challenging CALVIN benchmark,
demonstrating strong multi-task performance, and further validates its
effectiveness on MetaWorld. Despite the substantial domain gap between
simulation and reality and limited real-world data, we demonstrate reliable
real-world transfer with only minimal finetuning, illustrating the practical
viability of diffusion-based motion abstractions for robotic control. Our
results show the effectiveness of combining diffusion modeling with

Motivation: 现有基于VLM的方法将动作预测视为文本生成任务，而SPF认为空中视觉语言导航的动作预测应作为2D空间定位任务来处理，以实现更精确的导航。

Method: 利用VLM将模糊语言指令分解为输入图像上的2D航点迭代标注，结合预测的行驶距离，将2D航点转换为3D位移向量作为无人机动作命令，并自适应调整行驶距离。

Result: 在DRL仿真基准测试中达到新SOTA，比之前最佳方法绝对提升63%；在真实世界评估中大幅优于强基线；展示了对不同VLM的显著泛化能力。

Conclusion: SPF通过将动作预测重新定义为2D空间定位任务，实现了无需训练的高效空中视觉语言导航，在仿真和真实环境中均表现出色，具有良好的泛化性。

Abstract: We present See, Point, Fly (SPF), a training-free aerial vision-and-language
navigation (AVLN) framework built atop vision-language models (VLMs). SPF is
capable of navigating to any goal based on any type of free-form instructions
in any kind of environment. In contrast to existing VLM-based approaches that
treat action prediction as a text generation task, our key insight is to
consider action prediction for AVLN as a 2D spatial grounding task. SPF
harnesses VLMs to decompose vague language instructions into iterative
annotation of 2D waypoints on the input image. Along with the predicted
traveling distance, SPF transforms predicted 2D waypoints into 3D displacement
vectors as action commands for UAVs. Moreover, SPF also adaptively adjusts the
traveling distance to facilitate more efficient navigation. Notably, SPF
performs navigation in a closed-loop control manner, enabling UAVs to follow
dynamic targets in dynamic environments. SPF sets a new state of the art in DRL
simulation benchmark, outperforming the previous best method by an absolute
margin of 63%. In extensive real-world evaluations, SPF outperforms strong
baselines by a large margin. We also conduct comprehensive ablation studies to
highlight the effectiveness of our design choice. Lastly, SPF shows remarkable
generalization to different VLMs. Project page: https://spf-web.pages.dev

Main category: cs.AI

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练和评估白盒监控器需要展示目标行为的响应样本，但诱导行为的信息会泄露到监控器输入数据中，夸大其有效性。

Method: 提出内容过滤（移除欺骗相关文本）、分数过滤（仅聚合任务相关token）和提示蒸馏微调模型生物（无需显式提示即可展现欺骗行为）三种评估策略。

Result: 内容过滤可平滑移除诱导信号，使AUROC降低30%；分数过滤减少AUROC 15%；微调模型生物改善评估但使性能降低高达40%。

Conclusion: 识别了两种泄露形式（诱导泄露和推理泄露），提出的缓解策略能更准确评估监控器检测真实模型行为的能力。

Abstract: White box monitors that analyze model internals offer promising advantages
for detecting potentially harmful behaviors in large language models, including
lower computational costs and integration into layered defense systems.However,
training and evaluating these monitors requires response exemplars that exhibit
the target behaviors, typically elicited through prompting or fine-tuning. This
presents a challenge when the information used to elicit behaviors inevitably
leaks into the data that monitors ingest, inflating their effectiveness. We
present a systematic framework for evaluating a monitor's performance in terms
of its ability to detect genuine model behavior rather than superficial
elicitation artifacts. Furthermore, we propose three novel strategies to
evaluate the monitor: content filtering (removing deception-related text from
inputs), score filtering (aggregating only over task-relevant tokens), and
prompt distilled fine-tuned model organisms (models trained to exhibit
deceptive behavior without explicit prompting). Using deception detection as a
representative case study, we identify two forms of leakage that inflate
monitor performance: elicitation leakage from prompts that explicitly request
harmful behavior, and reasoning leakage from models that verbalize their
deceptive actions. Through experiments on multiple deception benchmarks, we
apply our proposed mitigation strategies and measure performance retention. Our
evaluation of the monitors reveal three crucial findings: (1) Content filtering
is a good mitigation strategy that allows for a smooth removal of elicitation
signal and can decrease probe AUROC by 30\% (2) Score filtering was found to
reduce AUROC by 15\% but is not as straightforward to attribute to (3) A
finetuned model organism improves monitor evaluations but reduces their
performance by upto 40\%, even when re-trained.

Result: 在LogiQA、MedQA和MATH500等标准基准测试中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 决策支点方法能够有效对齐推理过程，无需依赖真实推理数据或外部评估指标。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning exposes the intermediate thinking process of
large language models (LLMs), yet verifying those traces at scale remains
unsolved. In response, we introduce the idea of decision pivots-minimal,
verifiable checkpoints that any correct reasoning path must visit. We
hypothesize that correct reasoning, though stylistically diverse, converge on
the same pivot set, while incorrect ones violate at least one pivot. Leveraging
this property, we propose a self-training pipeline that (i) samples diverse
reasoning paths and mines shared decision pivots, (ii) compresses each trace
into pivot-focused short-path reasoning using an auxiliary verifier, and (iii)
post-trains the model using its self-generated outputs. The proposed method
aligns reasoning without ground truth reasoning data or external metrics.
Experiments on standard benchmarks such as LogiQA, MedQA, and MATH500 show the
effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Climate data science faces persistent barriers stemming from the fragmented
nature of data sources, heterogeneous formats, and the steep technical
expertise required to identify, acquire, and process datasets. These challenges
limit participation, slow discovery, and reduce the reproducibility of
scientific workflows. In this paper, we present a proof of concept for
addressing these barriers through the integration of a curated knowledge graph
(KG) with AI agents designed for cloud-native scientific workflows. The KG
provides a unifying layer that organizes datasets, tools, and workflows, while
AI agents -- powered by generative AI services -- enable natural language
interaction, automated data access, and streamlined analysis. Together, these
components drastically lower the technical threshold for engaging in climate
data science, enabling non-specialist users to identify and analyze relevant
datasets. By leveraging existing cloud-ready API data portals, we demonstrate
that "a knowledge graph is all you need" to unlock scalable and agentic
workflows for scientific inquiry. The open-source design of our system further
supports community contributions, ensuring that the KG and associated tools can

*Mohammad Parsa Afshar,Aryan Azimi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究使用脑电图数据和机器学习模型预测消费者行为，比较了传统机器学习模型和图神经网络在NeuMa数据集上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测消费者行为在营销、认知神经科学和人机交互中很重要，脑电图数据可以提供大脑神经活动的详细信息来分析决策过程。

Method: 从NeuMa数据集提取和清洗脑电图特征，为图神经网络创建大脑连接特征，使用包括传统模型和图神经网络在内的多种机器学习模型进行比较。

Result: 总体结果没有显著差异，但图神经网络在某些基本标准上表现更好，而传统模型在这些标准上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 脑电图信号分析与机器学习模型结合可以更深入理解消费者行为，并提供了传统模型与图神经网络在基于脑电图的神经营销中的全面比较。

Abstract: Prediction of consumer behavior is one of the important purposes in
marketing, cognitive neuroscience, and human-computer interaction. The
electroencephalography (EEG) data can help analyze the decision process by
providing detailed information about the brain's neural activity. In this
research, a comparative approach is utilized for predicting consumer behavior
by EEG data. In the first step, the features of the EEG data from the NeuMa
dataset were extracted and cleaned. For the Graph Neural Network (GNN) models,
the brain connectivity features were created. Different machine learning
models, such as classical models and Graph Neural Networks, are used and
compared. The GNN models with different architectures are implemented to have a
comprehensive comparison; furthermore, a wide range of classical models, such
as ensemble models, are applied, which can be very helpful to show the
difference and performance of each model on the dataset. Although the results
did not show a significant difference overall, the GNN models generally
performed better in some basic criteria where classical models were not
satisfactory. This study not only shows that combining EEG signal analysis and
machine learning models can provide an approach to deeper understanding of
consumer behavior, but also provides a comprehensive comparison between the
machine learning models that have been widely used in previous studies in the
EEG-based neuromarketing such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), and the models
which are not used or rarely used in the field, like Graph Neural Networks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GeoEvolve是一个多智能体LLM框架，通过结合进化搜索和地理空间领域知识来自动设计和优化地理空间算法，在地理插值和不确定性量化任务中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的算法发现框架缺乏地理空间领域知识和多步推理能力，难以解决复杂的地理空间问题。

Method: 采用双循环结构：内循环使用代码进化器生成和变异候选解，外循环通过智能体控制器评估全局精英，并查询GeoKnowRAG模块注入地理学理论先验知识。

Result: 在地理插值任务中减少RMSE误差13-21%，在不确定性估计中提升性能17%。消融研究证实领域知识引导的检索对稳定高质量进化至关重要。

Conclusion: GeoEvolve为自动化、知识驱动的地理空间建模提供了可扩展路径，为可信赖和高效的AI-for-Science发现开辟了新机会。

Abstract: Geospatial modeling provides critical solutions for pressing global
challenges such as sustainability and climate change. Existing large language
model (LLM)-based algorithm discovery frameworks, such as AlphaEvolve, excel at
evolving generic code but lack the domain knowledge and multi-step reasoning
required for complex geospatial problems. We introduce GeoEvolve, a multi-agent
LLM framework that couples evolutionary search with geospatial domain knowledge
to automatically design and refine geospatial algorithms. GeoEvolve operates in
two nested loops: an inner loop leverages a code evolver to generate and mutate
candidate solutions, while an outer agentic controller evaluates global elites
and queries a GeoKnowRAG module -- a structured geospatial knowledge base that
injects theoretical priors from geography. This knowledge-guided evolution
steers the search toward theoretically meaningful and computationally efficient
algorithms. We evaluate GeoEvolve on two fundamental and classical tasks:
spatial interpolation (kriging) and spatial uncertainty quantification
(geospatial conformal prediction). Across these benchmarks, GeoEvolve
automatically improves and discovers new algorithms, incorporating geospatial
theory on top of classical models. It reduces spatial interpolation error
(RMSE) by 13-21% and enhances uncertainty estimation performance by 17\%.
Ablation studies confirm that domain-guided retrieval is essential for stable,
high-quality evolution. These results demonstrate that GeoEvolve provides a
scalable path toward automated, knowledge-driven geospatial modeling, opening
new opportunities for trustworthy and efficient AI-for-Science discovery.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种可解释的多模态AI框架MultiFIX，通过整合临床变量和CT影像进行生存分析，在头颈癌数据集上取得了优于基线方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态数据的增长和临床对透明模型的需求，准确且可解释的生存分析在肿瘤学中变得愈发重要。

Method: 使用深度学习推断生存相关特征：影像特征通过Grad-CAM解释，临床变量通过遗传编程建模为符号表达式，风险估计采用透明的Cox回归进行分层。

Result: 在头颈癌RADCURE数据集上，MultiFIX实现了C-index为0.838（预测）和0.826（分层），优于临床和学术基线方法。

Conclusion: 结果凸显了可解释多模态AI在精准肿瘤学中的潜力，MultiFIX框架与已知预后标志物一致。

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable survival analysis remains a core challenge in
oncology. With growing multimodal data and the clinical need for transparent
models to support validation and trust, this challenge increases in complexity.
We propose an interpretable multimodal AI framework to automate survival
analysis by integrating clinical variables and computed tomography imaging. Our
MultiFIX-based framework uses deep learning to infer survival-relevant features
that are further explained: imaging features are interpreted via Grad-CAM,
while clinical variables are modeled as symbolic expressions through genetic
programming. Risk estimation employs a transparent Cox regression, enabling
stratification into groups with distinct survival outcomes. Using the
open-source RADCURE dataset for head and neck cancer, MultiFIX achieves a
C-index of 0.838 (prediction) and 0.826 (stratification), outperforming the
clinical and academic baseline approaches and aligning with known prognostic
markers. These results highlight the promise of interpretable multimodal AI for
precision oncology with MultiFIX.

*Georgios Chochlakis,Jackson Trager,Vedant Jhaveri,Nikhil Ravichandran,Alexandros Potamianos,Shrikanth Narayanan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了语义F1分数，这是一种用于主观或多标签分类的新评估指标，通过量化预测标签与黄金标签之间的语义相关性来改进传统F1指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统F1指标在处理语义相关但非完全相同的预测时将其视为完全失败，无法反映存在人类分歧或模糊类别边界的现实情况。

Method: 通过引入标签相似度矩阵计算软精度和软召回分数，采用新颖的两步精度-召回公式，允许比较任意大小的标签集，无需丢弃标签或强制匹配不相似的标签。

Result: 语义F1分数在理论和实证验证中显示出更好的可解释性和生态有效性，能够为语义相关但非相同的预测给予部分信用。

Conclusion: 语义F1分数提供了更公平的评估，适用于各种任务和模态，仅需要领域适当的相似度矩阵而非严格的分类体系。

Abstract: We propose Semantic F1 Scores, novel evaluation metrics for subjective or
fuzzy multi-label classification that quantify semantic relatedness between
predicted and gold labels. Unlike the conventional F1 metrics that treat
semantically related predictions as complete failures, Semantic F1 incorporates
a label similarity matrix to compute soft precision-like and recall-like
scores, from which the Semantic F1 scores are derived. Unlike existing
similarity-based metrics, our novel two-step precision-recall formulation
enables the comparison of label sets of arbitrary sizes without discarding
labels or forcing matches between dissimilar labels. By granting partial credit
for semantically related but nonidentical labels, Semantic F1 better reflects
the realities of domains marked by human disagreement or fuzzy category
boundaries. In this way, it provides fairer evaluations: it recognizes that
categories overlap, that annotators disagree, and that downstream decisions
based on similar predictions lead to similar outcomes. Through theoretical
justification and extensive empirical validation on synthetic and real data, we
show that Semantic F1 demonstrates greater interpretability and ecological
validity. Because it requires only a domain-appropriate similarity matrix,
which is robust to misspecification, and not a rigid ontology, it is applicable
across tasks and modalities.

Result: 全面分析了主要基础模型感知风险、推理安全和触发干预的能力；开发的后训练模型在约束满足评估中达到最先进性能，生成可解释的安全推理轨迹。

Conclusion: 提出的基准测试方法能够有效评估具身AI系统的安全准备度，后训练范式显著提升了模型的安全推理透明度和性能。

Abstract: When AI interacts with the physical world -- as a robot or an assistive agent
-- new safety challenges emerge beyond those of purely ``digital AI". In such
interactions, the potential for physical harm is direct and immediate. How well
do state-of-the-art foundation models understand common-sense facts about
physical safety, e.g. that a box may be too heavy to lift, or that a hot cup of
coffee should not be handed to a child? In this paper, our contributions are
three-fold: first, we develop a highly scalable approach to continuous physical
safety benchmarking of Embodied AI systems, grounded in real-world injury
narratives and operational safety constraints. To probe multi-modal safety
understanding, we turn these narratives and constraints into photorealistic
images and videos capturing transitions from safe to unsafe states, using
advanced generative models. Secondly, we comprehensively analyze the ability of
major foundation models to perceive risks, reason about safety, and trigger
interventions; this yields multi-faceted insights into their deployment
readiness for safety-critical agentic applications. Finally, we develop a
post-training paradigm to teach models to explicitly reason about
embodiment-specific safety constraints provided through system instructions.
The resulting models generate thinking traces that make safety reasoning
interpretable and transparent, achieving state of the art performance in
constraint satisfaction evaluations. The benchmark will be released at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于GRPO的框架，通过多语言预训练和有限配对数据微调，结合ASR、说话人验证和音频质量评估的多目标奖励，在低资源语言中实现高质量的文本转语音合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言文本转语音系统开发面临的配对数据稀缺问题，利用更易获取的自动语音识别模型来提升TTS性能。

Method: 1) 使用IPA标记训练多语言基线模型；2) 在目标语言有限配对数据上微调；3) 应用GRPO优化，仅使用非配对文本和说话人提示，通过预训练ASR、说话人验证和音频质量评估模型的多目标奖励进行指导。

Result: 在低资源语言中产生可理解且说话人一致的语音，显著优于单独微调；在高资源语言中也超越DPO等离线对齐方法，在可理解性、说话人相似性和音频质量方面表现更优。

Conclusion: GRPO框架能够有效利用非配对数据提升TTS性能，在低资源和高资源语言中均取得显著改进，为低资源语言TTS系统开发提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Developing high-quality text-to-speech (TTS) systems for low-resource
languages is challenging due to the scarcity of paired text and speech data. In
contrast, automatic speech recognition (ASR) models for such languages are
often more accessible, owing to large-scale multilingual pre-training efforts.
We propose a framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to
adapt an autoregressive, multilingual TTS model to new languages. Our method
first establishes a language-agnostic foundation for TTS synthesis by training
a multilingual baseline with International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) tokens.
Next, we fine-tune this model on limited paired data of the new languages to
capture the target language's prosodic features. Finally, we apply GRPO to
optimize the model using only unpaired text and speaker prompts, guided by a
multi-objective reward from pretrained ASR, speaker verification, and audio
quality estimation models. Experiments demonstrate that this pipeline produces
intelligible and speaker-consistent speech in low-resource languages,
substantially outperforming fine-tuning alone. Furthermore, our GRPO-based
framework also improves TTS performance in high-resource languages, surpassing
offline alignment methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) yielding
superior intelligibility, speaker similarity, and audio quality.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RoT（Retrieval-of-Thought）通过检索和重用先前的推理步骤作为可组合的"思想"来指导新问题，显著提高了大型推理模型的效率，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型通过生成长推理轨迹来提高准确性，但这增加了延迟和成本，因此需要在推理时提高效率。

Method: RoT将推理步骤组织成具有顺序和语义边的思想图，通过检索查询相关节点并应用奖励引导遍历来组装问题特定的模板，指导生成过程。

Result: RoT在多个模型上的推理基准测试显示，输出token减少高达40%，推理延迟降低82%，成本降低59%，同时保持准确性。

Conclusion: RoT通过检索动态构建模板，为高效的大型推理模型推理建立了可扩展的范式。

Abstract: Large reasoning models improve accuracy by producing long reasoning traces,
but this inflates latency and cost, motivating inference-time efficiency. We
propose Retrieval-of-Thought (RoT), which reuses prior reasoning as composable
``thought" steps to guide new problems. RoT organizes steps into a thought
graph with sequential and semantic edges to enable fast retrieval and flexible
recombination. At inference, RoT retrieves query-relevant nodes and applies
reward-guided traversal to assemble a problem-specific template that guides
generation. This dynamic template reuse reduces redundant exploration and,
therefore, reduces output tokens while preserving accuracy. We evaluate RoT on
reasoning benchmarks with multiple models, measuring accuracy, token usage,
latency, and memory overhead. Findings show small prompt growth but substantial
efficiency gains, with RoT reducing output tokens by up to 40%, inference
latency by 82%, and cost by 59% while maintaining accuracy. RoT establishes a
scalable paradigm for efficient LRM reasoning via dynamic template construction
through retrieval.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于神经VRP求解器的终身学习框架LLR-BC，通过行为整合有效解决灾难性遗忘问题，在多个任务中保持性能并提升零样本泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经求解器通常基于一次性训练，面对新任务时要么依赖零样本泛化（性能可能较差），要么需要微调（可能导致灾难性遗忘）。本文探索神经VRP求解器的终身学习范式，要求求解器能有效学习新任务同时保持对已学任务的性能。

Method: 提出LLR-BC框架，通过行为整合有效巩固先验知识，以决策寻求的方式对齐新任务训练求解器与缓冲求解器的行为。为鼓励更关注关键经验，LLR-BC为置信度较低的决策分配更大的整合权重。

Result: 在容量约束车辆路径问题和旅行商问题上的大量实验表明，LLR-BC在终身学习设置下能有效训练高性能神经求解器，解决灾难性遗忘问题，保持其可塑性，并提高零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: LLR-BC框架为神经VRP求解器提供了一种有效的终身学习解决方案，能够在新任务不断出现的情况下持续学习和保持性能。

Abstract: Recent neural solvers have demonstrated promising performance in learning to
solve routing problems. However, existing studies are primarily based on
one-off training on one or a set of predefined problem distributions and
scales, i.e., tasks. When a new task arises, they typically rely on either
zero-shot generalization, which may be poor due to the discrepancies between
the new task and the training task(s), or fine-tuning the pretrained solver on
the new task, which possibly leads to catastrophic forgetting of knowledge
acquired from previous tasks. This paper explores a novel lifelong learning
paradigm for neural VRP solvers, where multiple tasks with diverse
distributions and scales arise sequentially over time. Solvers are required to
effectively and efficiently learn to solve new tasks while maintaining their
performance on previously learned tasks. Consequently, a novel framework called
Lifelong Learning Router with Behavior Consolidation (LLR-BC) is proposed.
LLR-BC consolidates prior knowledge effectively by aligning behaviors of the
solver trained on a new task with the buffered ones in a decision-seeking way.
To encourage more focus on crucial experiences, LLR-BC assigns greater
consolidated weights to decisions with lower confidence. Extensive experiments
on capacitated vehicle routing problems and traveling salesman problems
demonstrate LLR-BC's effectiveness in training high-performance neural solvers
in a lifelong learning setting, addressing the catastrophic forgetting issue,
maintaining their plasticity, and improving zero-shot generalization ability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为UltraHorizon的新基准测试，用于评估智能体在长视野、部分可观测场景下的持续推理、规划、记忆管理和工具使用能力，填补了现有基准测试的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要关注短视野、完全可观测任务，而许多现实世界关键任务（如软件开发、投资、科学发现）需要在长视野、部分可观测场景下进行，现有基准测试很少捕捉这些挑战。

Method: 使用探索作为统一任务，在三个不同环境中验证核心能力。智能体在长视野发现任务中必须通过持续推理、规划、记忆和工具管理，与环境交互来迭代发现隐藏规则。

Result: 实验显示LLM智能体在这些设置下表现不佳，而人类参与者得分更高，表明智能体在长视野能力方面存在持续差距。简单扩展方法在任务中失败，识别出八种错误类型，归因于上下文锁定和功能基础能力差距。

Conclusion: UltraHorizon基准测试揭示了当前智能体在长视野任务中的局限性，为未来研究提供了重要的评估框架，并指出了需要改进的关键能力领域。

Abstract: Autonomous agents have recently achieved remarkable progress across diverse
domains, yet most evaluations focus on short-horizon, fully observable tasks.
In contrast, many critical real-world tasks, such as large-scale software
development, commercial investment, and scientific discovery, unfold in
long-horizon and partially observable scenarios where success hinges on
sustained reasoning, planning, memory management, and tool use. Existing
benchmarks rarely capture these long-horizon challenges, leaving a gap in
systematic evaluation. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{UltraHorizon} a
novel benchmark that measures the foundational capabilities essential for
complex real-world challenges. We use exploration as a unifying task across
three distinct environments to validate these core competencies. Agents are
designed in long-horizon discovery tasks where they must iteratively uncover
hidden rules through sustained reasoning, planning, memory and tools
management, and interaction with environments. Under the heaviest scale
setting, trajectories average \textbf{200k+} tokens and \textbf{400+} tool
calls, whereas in standard configurations they still exceed \textbf{35k} tokens
and involve more than \textbf{60} tool calls on average. Our extensive
experiments reveal that LLM-agents consistently underperform in these settings,
whereas human participants achieve higher scores, underscoring a persistent gap
in agents' long-horizon abilities. We also observe that simple scaling fails in
our task. To better illustrate the failure of agents, we conduct an in-depth
analysis of collected trajectories. We identify eight types of errors and
attribute them to two primary causes: in-context locking and functional
fundamental capability gaps.

Motivation: 现有基准主要关注视觉感知或UI代码生成，缺乏对端到端网页应用所需的推理、鲁棒性和安全性能力的充分评估。

Method: 从729个网站构建包含3799个问答对的基准，涵盖位置关系推理、颜色鲁棒性、安全关键检测等8个任务，采用标准化提示、确定性评估脚本和多阶段质量控制。

Result: 评估12个MLLM发现显著差距：模型在真实布局的组合和跨元素推理上仍有困难，面对UI和内容扰动时鲁棒性有限，在识别和避免安全关键操作方面过于保守。

Conclusion: WebRSSBench揭示了当前MLLM在网页理解能力上的重要局限，为未来模型开发提供了重要基准和方向。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly positioned as AI
collaborators for building complex web-related applications like GUI agents and
front-end code generation. However, existing benchmarks largely emphasize
visual perception or UI code generation, showing insufficient evaluation on the
reasoning, robustness and safety capability required for end-to-end web
applications. To bridge the gap, we introduce a comprehensive web understanding
benchmark, named WebRSSBench, that jointly evaluates Reasoning, Robustness, and
Safety across eight tasks, such as position relationship reasoning, color
robustness, and safety critical detection, etc. The benchmark is constructed
from 729 websites and contains 3799 question answer pairs that probe multi-step
inference over page structure, text, widgets, and safety-critical interactions.
To ensure reliable measurement, we adopt standardized prompts, deterministic
evaluation scripts, and multi-stage quality control combining automatic checks
with targeted human verification. We evaluate 12 MLLMs on WebRSSBench. The
results reveal significant gaps, models still struggle with compositional and
cross-element reasoning over realistic layouts, show limited robustness when
facing perturbations in user interfaces and content such as layout
rearrangements or visual style shifts, and are rather conservative in
recognizing and avoiding safety critical or irreversible actions. Our code is
available at https://github.com/jinliang-byte/webssrbench.

TL;DR: D-Artemis是一个基于人类认知循环（思考、对齐、反思）的新型GUI代理框架，通过细粒度应用提示检索、预执行对齐和状态反思机制，无需复杂轨迹数据集训练即可显著提升多模态大语言模型在GUI任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前GUI代理方法面临数据瓶颈、延迟错误检测成本高和矛盾指导风险等关键挑战，需要更有效的认知机制来提升自动化任务的可靠性和效率。

Method: 提出D-Artemis框架：1）应用特定提示检索机制；2）预执行对齐阶段，包含思想-行动一致性检查和行动校正代理；3）状态反思代理完成认知循环。

Result: 在两个主要基准测试中创下新SOTA：AndroidWorld上达到75.8%成功率，ScreenSpot-V2上达到96.8%成功率。消融研究证实各组件对框架性能的重要贡献。

Conclusion: D-Artemis通过模拟人类认知循环，在不依赖复杂轨迹数据集训练的情况下，显著增强了通用多模态大语言模型在GUI任务中的能力，展示了强大的泛化性能。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents aim to automate a wide spectrum of
human tasks by emulating user interaction. Despite rapid advancements, current
approaches are hindered by several critical challenges: data bottleneck in
end-to-end training, high cost of delayed error detection, and risk of
contradictory guidance. Inspired by the human cognitive loop of Thinking,
Alignment, and Reflection, we present D-Artemis -- a novel deliberative
framework in this paper. D-Artemis leverages a fine-grained, app-specific tip
retrieval mechanism to inform its decision-making process. It also employs a
proactive Pre-execution Alignment stage, where Thought-Action Consistency (TAC)
Check module and Action Correction Agent (ACA) work in concert to mitigate the
risk of execution failures. A post-execution Status Reflection Agent (SRA)
completes the cognitive loop, enabling strategic learning from experience.
Crucially, D-Artemis enhances the capabilities of general-purpose Multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) for GUI tasks without the need for training on
complex trajectory datasets, demonstrating strong generalization. D-Artemis
establishes new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across both major benchmarks,
achieving a 75.8% success rate on AndroidWorld and 96.8% on ScreenSpot-V2.
Extensive ablation studies further demonstrate the significant contribution of
each component to the framework.

TL;DR: ProRe是一个主动奖励系统，通过通用推理器和领域特定评估器主动与环境交互来收集额外观察，从而为GUI智能体提供更准确和可验证的奖励。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于规则或模型的奖励方法难以泛化到GUI智能体，因为通常无法获得真实轨迹或应用数据库，而基于静态轨迹的LLM-as-a-Judge方法准确率有限。

Method: ProRe系统包含通用推理器和领域特定评估器。推理器调度有针对性的状态探测任务，评估器通过主动与环境交互执行这些任务来收集额外观察，从而支持更准确的奖励分配。

Result: 在超过3000条轨迹上的实验表明，ProRe将奖励准确率和F1分数分别提高了5.3%和19.4%。与最先进的策略智能体集成后，成功率提高了22.4%。

Conclusion: ProRe通过主动环境交互显著提高了GUI智能体奖励评估的准确性和有效性，为智能体训练提供了更可靠的奖励信号。

Abstract: Reward is critical to the evaluation and training of large language models
(LLMs). However, existing rule-based or model-based reward methods struggle to
generalize to GUI agents, where access to ground-truth trajectories or
application databases is often unavailable, and static trajectory-based
LLM-as-a-Judge approaches suffer from limited accuracy. To address these
challenges, we propose ProRe, a proactive reward system that leverages a
general-purpose reasoner and domain-specific evaluator agents (actors). The
reasoner schedules targeted state probing tasks, which the evaluator agents
then execute by actively interacting with the environment to collect additional
observations. This enables the reasoner to assign more accurate and verifiable
rewards to GUI agents. Empirical results on over 3K trajectories demonstrate
that ProRe improves reward accuracy and F1 score by up to 5.3% and 19.4%,
respectively. Furthermore, integrating ProRe with state-of-the-art policy
agents yields a success rate improvement of up to 22.4%.

Conclusion: DS-STAR通过其迭代优化和验证机制，能够可靠地导航涉及多样化数据源的复杂分析任务，有效解决了数据科学自动化中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Data science, which transforms raw data into actionable insights, is critical
for data-driven decision-making. However, these tasks are often complex,
involving steps for exploring multiple data sources and synthesizing findings
to deliver insightful answers. While large language models (LLMs) show
significant promise in automating this process, they often struggle with
heterogeneous data formats and generate sub-optimal analysis plans, as
verifying plan sufficiency is inherently difficult without ground-truth labels
for such open-ended tasks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DS-STAR,
a novel data science agent. Specifically, DS-STAR makes three key
contributions: (1) a data file analysis module that automatically explores and
extracts context from diverse data formats, including unstructured types; (2) a
verification step where an LLM-based judge evaluates the sufficiency of the
analysis plan at each stage; and (3) a sequential planning mechanism that
starts with a simple, executable plan and iteratively refines it based on the
DS-STAR's feedback until its sufficiency is verified. This iterative refinement
allows DS-STAR to reliably navigate complex analyses involving diverse data
sources. Our experiments show that DS-STAR achieves state-of-the-art
performance across three challenging benchmarks: DABStep, KramaBench, and
DA-Code. Moreover, DS-STAR particularly outperforms baselines on hard tasks
that require processing multiple data files with heterogeneous formats.

Motivation: 研究如何用公理（如伦理约束）来建模决策，并探索决策公理的结构特性。

Method: 引入了一个决策建模框架，定义了基于结构特性的决策公理分类法，并展示了决策-评估悖论。

Result: 证明了决策-评估悖论在实际公理结构中存在，揭示了在决策制定和评估中使用公理的潜在冲突。

Conclusion: 在训练决策模型和应用公理进行决策制定与评估时必须格外小心，以避免决策-评估悖论带来的问题。

Abstract: We introduce a framework for modeling decisions with axioms that are
statements about decisions, e.g., ethical constraints. Using our framework we
define a taxonomy of decision axioms based on their structural properties and
demonstrate a tension between the use of axioms to make decisions and the use
of axioms to evaluate decisions which we call the Decision-Evaluation Paradox.
We argue that the Decision-Evaluation Paradox arises with realistic axiom
structures, and the paradox illuminates why one must be exceptionally careful
when training models on decision data or applying axioms to make and evaluate
decisions.

Abstract: Travel planning (TP) agent has recently worked as an emerging building block
to interact with external tools and resources for travel itinerary generation,
ensuring enjoyable user experience. Despite its benefits, existing studies rely
on hand craft prompt and fixed agent workflow, hindering more flexible and
autonomous TP agent. This paper proposes DeepTravel, an end to end agentic
reinforcement learning framework for building autonomous travel planning agent,
capable of autonomously planning, executing tools, and reflecting on tool
responses to explore, verify, and refine intermediate actions in multi step
reasoning. To achieve this, we first construct a robust sandbox environment by
caching transportation, accommodation and POI data, facilitating TP agent
training without being constrained by real world APIs limitations (e.g.,
inconsistent outputs). Moreover, we develop a hierarchical reward modeling
system, where a trajectory level verifier first checks spatiotemporal
feasibility and filters unsatisfied travel itinerary, and then the turn level
verifier further validate itinerary detail consistency with tool responses,
enabling efficient and precise reward service. Finally, we propose the reply
augmented reinforcement learning method that enables TP agent to periodically
replay from a failures experience buffer, emerging notable agentic capacity. We
deploy trained TP agent on DiDi Enterprise Solutions App and conduct
comprehensive online and offline evaluations, demonstrating that DeepTravel
enables small size LLMs (e.g., Qwen3 32B) to significantly outperform existing
frontier LLMs such as OpenAI o1, o3 and DeepSeek R1 in travel planning tasks.

Motivation: 当前研究大语言模型驱动的多智能体系统涌现行为面临缺乏受控实验原则性方法的限制，需要超越脆弱、临时的智能体设计，实现系统性分析。

Method: 提出Shachi框架，将智能体策略分解为配置（内在特征）、记忆（上下文持久性）和工具（扩展能力）三个核心认知组件，由LLM推理引擎协调，支持模块化架构设计。

Result: 在10个任务的基准测试中验证了方法论的有效性，通过建模真实世界美国关税冲击案例，证明只有当智能体的认知架构正确配置记忆和工具时，其行为才能与观察到的市场反应一致。

Conclusion: Shachi为构建和评估LLM智能体提供了严谨的开源基础，旨在促进更累积和科学基础的研究。

Abstract: The study of emergent behaviors in large language model (LLM)-driven
multi-agent systems is a critical research challenge, yet progress is limited
by a lack of principled methodologies for controlled experimentation. To
address this, we introduce Shachi, a formal methodology and modular framework
that decomposes an agent's policy into core cognitive components: Configuration
for intrinsic traits, Memory for contextual persistence, and Tools for expanded
capabilities, all orchestrated by an LLM reasoning engine. This principled
architecture moves beyond brittle, ad-hoc agent designs and enables the
systematic analysis of how specific architectural choices influence collective
behavior. We validate our methodology on a comprehensive 10-task benchmark and
demonstrate its power through novel scientific inquiries. Critically, we
establish the external validity of our approach by modeling a real-world U.S.
tariff shock, showing that agent behaviors align with observed market reactions
only when their cognitive architecture is appropriately configured with memory
and tools. Our work provides a rigorous, open-source foundation for building
and evaluating LLM agents, aimed at fostering more cumulative and
scientifically grounded research.

TL;DR: TRACE提出了一种新的图表示学习范式，通过层次化Transformer架构和函数偏移学习目标，解决了传统消息传递神经网络在计算图建模中的架构不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统消息传递神经网络及其Transformer变体在计算图建模中存在架构不匹配，无法捕捉计算的位置感知和层次化特性，这限制了模型对计算功能行为的建模能力。

Method: TRACE采用层次化Transformer架构模拟逐步计算流程，并引入函数偏移学习目标，将复杂全局函数预测分解为预测真实全局函数与简单局部近似之间的差异。

Result: 在电子电路这一复杂且经济关键的计算图类别上，TRACE在全面基准测试中显著优于所有现有架构。

Conclusion: 架构对齐的主干网络和解耦学习目标构成了更稳健的图计算学习范式，为解决学习计算这一基础挑战提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Learning to compute, the ability to model the functional behavior of a
computational graph, is a fundamental challenge for graph representation
learning. Yet, the dominant paradigm is architecturally mismatched for this
task. This flawed assumption, central to mainstream message passing neural
networks (MPNNs) and their conventional Transformer-based counterparts,
prevents models from capturing the position-aware, hierarchical nature of
computation. To resolve this, we introduce \textbf{TRACE}, a new paradigm built
on an architecturally sound backbone and a principled learning objective.
First, TRACE employs a Hierarchical Transformer that mirrors the step-by-step
flow of computation, providing a faithful architectural backbone that replaces
the flawed permutation-invariant aggregation. Second, we introduce
\textbf{function shift learning}, a novel objective that decouples the learning
problem. Instead of predicting the complex global function directly, our model
is trained to predict only the \textit{function shift}, the discrepancy between
the true global function and a simple local approximation that assumes input
independence. We validate this paradigm on electronic circuits, one of the most
complex and economically critical classes of computational graphs. Across a
comprehensive suite of benchmarks, TRACE substantially outperforms all prior
architectures. These results demonstrate that our architecturally-aligned
backbone and decoupled learning objective form a more robust paradigm for the
fundamental challenge of learning to compute on graphs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态作业车间调度面临新作业频繁到达的干扰，离线学习策略往往不完美，而在线规划又因信息不完整容易受到扰动影响。

Method: DyRo-MCTS方法在MCTS中集成动作鲁棒性估计，引导生产环境朝向既产生良好调度结果又易于适应未来作业到达的状态。

Result: 实验表明DyRo-MCTS显著提升了离线学习策略的性能，且在线规划时间增加可忽略不计，在各种调度场景下始终优于普通MCTS。

Conclusion: DyRo-MCTS能够做出鲁棒的调度决策，在扰动下带来长期、可持续的性能提升。

Abstract: Dynamic job shop scheduling, a fundamental combinatorial optimisation problem
in various industrial sectors, poses substantial challenges for effective
scheduling due to frequent disruptions caused by the arrival of new jobs.
State-of-the-art methods employ machine learning to learn scheduling policies
offline, enabling rapid responses to dynamic events. However, these offline
policies are often imperfect, necessitating the use of planning techniques such
as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to improve performance at online decision
time. The unpredictability of new job arrivals complicates online planning, as
decisions based on incomplete problem information are vulnerable to
disturbances. To address this issue, we propose the Dynamic Robust MCTS
(DyRo-MCTS) approach, which integrates action robustness estimation into MCTS.
DyRo-MCTS guides the production environment toward states that not only yield
good scheduling outcomes but are also easily adaptable to future job arrivals.
Extensive experiments show that DyRo-MCTS significantly improves the
performance of offline-learned policies with negligible additional online
planning time. Moreover, DyRo-MCTS consistently outperforms vanilla MCTS across
various scheduling scenarios. Further analysis reveals that its ability to make
robust scheduling decisions leads to long-term, sustainable performance gains
under disturbances.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究比较了统计参数映射(SPM)和可解释机器学习方法在足底压力数据异常检测中的表现，发现机器学习模型在准确性上优于SPM，且两种方法的解释性都被专家认为是清晰有用的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 足底压力映射在临床诊断和运动科学中很重要，但大型异构数据集常包含技术错误或程序不一致导致的异常值。SPM提供可解释分析但对配准敏感，其稳健异常检测能力尚不明确。

Method: 使用来自多个中心的数据，通过专家共识标注并添加合成异常，共798个有效样本和2000个异常值。评估了(i)非参数、配准依赖的SPM方法和(ii)使用SHAP解释的卷积神经网络(CNN)。

Result: ML模型达到高准确率并优于SPM，SPM误分类了临床有意义的变异并遗漏了真实异常。专家认为SPM和SHAP解释都清晰、有用且可信，但SPM被认为复杂度较低。

Conclusion: SPM和可解释ML在足底压力数据自动异常检测中具有互补潜力，强调了在将复杂模型输出转化为可解释见解以有效支持决策时解释性的重要性。

Abstract: Plantar pressure mapping is essential in clinical diagnostics and sports
science, yet large heterogeneous datasets often contain outliers from technical
errors or procedural inconsistencies. Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM)
provides interpretable analyses but is sensitive to alignment and its capacity
for robust outlier detection remains unclear. This study compares an SPM
approach with an explainable machine learning (ML) approach to establish
transparent quality-control pipelines for plantar pressure datasets. Data from
multiple centers were annotated by expert consensus and enriched with synthetic
anomalies resulting in 798 valid samples and 2000 outliers. We evaluated (i) a
non-parametric, registration-dependent SPM approach and (ii) a convolutional
neural network (CNN), explained using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP).
Performance was assessed via nested cross-validation; explanation quality via a
semantic differential survey with domain experts. The ML model reached high
accuracy and outperformed SPM, which misclassified clinically meaningful
variations and missed true outliers. Experts perceived both SPM and SHAP
explanations as clear, useful, and trustworthy, though SPM was assessed less
complex. These findings highlight the complementary potential of SPM and
explainable ML as approaches for automated outlier detection in plantar
pressure data, and underscore the importance of explainability in translating
complex model outputs into interpretable insights that can effectively inform
decision-making.

TL;DR: CoBel-World是一个为LLM智能体设计的协作信念世界框架，通过建模物理环境和合作者心理状态，实现动态意图推理，显著减少通信成本并提高任务完成效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM协作框架忽视了动态意图推理能力，导致计划不一致和通信冗余，降低协作效率。需要让智能体能够推理合作者意图以避免协调失误。

Method: 提出CoBel-World框架，为LLM智能体配备协作信念世界，通过符号信念语言将开放世界任务知识解析为结构化信念，并基于LLM推理进行零样本贝叶斯式信念更新。

Result: 在TDW-MAT和C-WAH基准测试中，CoBel-World相比最强基线显著减少通信成本22-60%，提高任务完成效率4-28%。

Conclusion: 显式的意图感知信念建模对于基于LLM的多智能体系统实现高效、类人协作至关重要。

Abstract: Effective real-world multi-agent collaboration requires not only accurate
planning but also the ability to reason about collaborators' intents -- a
crucial capability for avoiding miscoordination and redundant communication
under partial observable environments. Due to their strong planning and
reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising
autonomous agents for collaborative task solving. However, existing
collaboration frameworks for LLMs overlook their reasoning potential for
dynamic intent inference, and thus produce inconsistent plans and redundant
communication, reducing collaboration efficiency. To bridge this gap, we
propose CoBel-World, a novel framework that equips LLM agents with a
collaborative belief world -- an internal representation jointly modeling the
physical environment and collaborators' mental states. CoBel-World enables
agents to parse open-world task knowledge into structured beliefs via a
symbolic belief language, and perform zero-shot Bayesian-style belief updates
through LLM reasoning. This allows agents to proactively detect potential
miscoordination (e.g., conflicting plans) and communicate adaptively. Evaluated
on challenging embodied benchmarks (i.e., TDW-MAT and C-WAH), CoBel-World
significantly reduces communication costs by 22-60% and improves task
completion efficiency by 4-28% compared to the strongest baseline. Our results
show that explicit, intent-aware belief modeling is essential for efficient and
human-like collaboration in LLM-based multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: RISK框架为电商风险管理构建GUI代理，包含数据集、基准测试和强化微调框架，在单步和多步任务中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统爬虫方法和现有GUI代理无法处理电商风险管理中需要多步状态交互的动态网页内容，需要专门解决方案。

Method: RISK框架包含三个组件：RISK-Data数据集、RISK-Bench基准测试和RISK-R1强化微调框架，后者考虑输出格式、单步准确率、多步过程重加权和任务难度重加权四个维度。

Result: RISK-R1在离线单步任务中提升6.8%，离线多步任务中提升8.8%，在线评估中达到70.5%的最高任务成功率。

Conclusion: RISK为自动化复杂网页交互提供了可扩展的领域特定解决方案，推动了电商风险管理的技术进步。

Abstract: E-commerce risk management requires aggregating diverse, deeply embedded web
data through multi-step, stateful interactions, which traditional scraping
methods and most existing Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents cannot handle.
These agents are typically limited to single-step tasks and lack the ability to
manage dynamic, interactive content critical for effective risk assessment. To
address this challenge, we introduce RISK, a novel framework designed to build
and deploy GUI agents for this domain. RISK integrates three components: (1)
RISK-Data, a dataset of 8,492 single-step and 2,386 multi-step interaction
trajectories, collected through a high-fidelity browser framework and a
meticulous data curation process; (2) RISK-Bench, a benchmark with 802
single-step and 320 multi-step trajectories across three difficulty levels for
standardized evaluation; and (3) RISK-R1, a R1-style reinforcement fine-tuning
framework considering four aspects: (i) Output Format: Updated format reward to
enhance output syntactic correctness and task comprehension, (ii) Single-step
Level: Stepwise accuracy reward to provide granular feedback during early
training stages, (iii) Multi-step Level: Process reweight to emphasize critical
later steps in interaction sequences, and (iv) Task Level: Level reweight to
focus on tasks of varying difficulty. Experiments show that RISK-R1 outperforms
existing baselines, achieving a 6.8% improvement in offline single-step and an
8.8% improvement in offline multi-step. Moreover, it attains a top task success
rate of 70.5% in online evaluation. RISK provides a scalable, domain-specific
solution for automating complex web interactions, advancing the state of the
art in e-commerce risk management.

*Dong-Kyum Kim,Minsung Kim,Jea Kwon,Nakyeong Yang,Meeyoung Cha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究表明反向诅咒不是语言模型的内在缺陷，而是知识编码方式的产物。通过在关系知识图谱上训练模型，可以诱导出双线性关系结构，从而显著缓解反向诅咒问题，并实现逻辑一致的模型编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型中的反向诅咒问题——即模型无法从已知事实"A是B"推断出反向事实"B是A"，并探索模型编辑时的逻辑一致性。

Method: 在合成的关系知识图谱数据集上从头训练语言模型，分析其隐藏表示中出现的双线性关系结构。

Result: 双线性关系结构显著缓解了反向诅咒，使模型能够推断未见过的反向事实。该结构在模型编辑中起关键作用，能正确传播编辑到相关事实，而缺乏此结构的模型会产生逻辑不一致。

Conclusion: 关系知识训练诱导出双线性内部表示，使语言模型在编辑后能保持逻辑一致性。模型编辑的成功不仅取决于编辑算法，更关键的是被修改知识的底层表示几何结构。

Abstract: The reversal curse -- a language model's (LM) inability to infer an unseen
fact ``B is A'' from a learned fact ``A is B'' -- is widely considered a
fundamental limitation. We show that this is not an inherent failure but an
artifact of how models encode knowledge. By training LMs from scratch on a
synthetic dataset of relational knowledge graphs, we demonstrate that bilinear
relational structure emerges in their hidden representations. This structure
substantially alleviates the reversal curse, enabling LMs to infer unseen
reverse facts. Crucially, we also find that this bilinear structure plays a key
role in consistent model editing. When a fact is updated in a LM with this
structure, the edit correctly propagates to its reverse and other logically
dependent facts. In contrast, models lacking this representation not only
suffer from the reversal curse but also fail to generalize edits, further
introducing logical inconsistencies. Our results establish that training on a
relational knowledge dataset induces the emergence of bilinear internal
representations, which in turn enable LMs to behave in a logically consistent
manner after editing. This implies that the success of model editing depends
critically not just on editing algorithms but on the underlying
representational geometry of the knowledge being modified.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了GSM-Agent基准测试，评估LLM在需要主动使用工具收集信息来解决小学水平数学问题时的代理推理能力，发现即使前沿模型准确率也仅67%，并提出了代理推理图概念和工具增强的测试时扩展方法来改进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代理基准测试往往将代理推理与复杂的数学推理、专家级知识等高级能力混在一起，难以单独评估代理推理能力，因此需要构建一个能够纯粹评估代理推理能力的基准。

Method: 构建GSM-Agent基准，要求LLM代理解决小学水平推理问题，但提示中只给出问题而不包含必要的前提信息，需要主动使用工具收集信息；提出代理推理图概念，将环境文档嵌入聚类为节点，将每个工具调用映射到最近节点来构建推理路径；提出工具增强的测试时扩展方法，通过添加工具鼓励模型重新访问节点。

Result: 即使像GPT-5这样的前沿模型在GSM-Agent基准上也只能达到67%的准确率；发现许多模型在代理推理中缺乏重新访问先前访问节点的能力；提出的工具增强测试时扩展方法能够改进LLM的代理推理性能。

Conclusion: GSM-Agent基准和代理推理框架有助于未来理解和推进代理推理边界的研究，强调了重新访问节点能力在代理推理中的重要性。

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly deployed as agents, agentic reasoning - the ability
to combine tool use, especially search, and reasoning - becomes a critical
skill. However, it is hard to disentangle agentic reasoning when evaluated in
complex environments and tasks. Current agent benchmarks often mix agentic
reasoning with challenging math reasoning, expert-level knowledge, and other
advanced capabilities. To fill this gap, we build a novel benchmark, GSM-Agent,
where an LLM agent is required to solve grade-school-level reasoning problems,
but is only presented with the question in the prompt without the premises that
contain the necessary information to solve the task, and needs to proactively
collect that information using tools. Although the original tasks are
grade-school math problems, we observe that even frontier models like GPT-5
only achieve 67% accuracy. To understand and analyze the agentic reasoning
patterns, we propose the concept of agentic reasoning graph: cluster the
environment's document embeddings into nodes, and map each tool call to its
nearest node to build a reasoning path. Surprisingly, we identify that the
ability to revisit a previously visited node, widely taken as a crucial pattern
in static reasoning, is often missing for agentic reasoning for many models.
Based on the insight, we propose a tool-augmented test-time scaling method to
improve LLM's agentic reasoning performance by adding tools to encourage models
to revisit. We expect our benchmark and the agentic reasoning framework to aid
future studies of understanding and pushing the boundaries of agentic
reasoning.

Method: 进行大规模实证研究，评估多种模型合并技术在不同推理基准上的表现，系统性地改变合并强度来构建精度-效率曲线。

Result: 研究发现模型合并提供了一种有效且可控的方法来校准推理精度与标记效率之间的权衡，即使父模型具有高度不同的权重空间。在某些情况下实现了帕累托改进，即合并模型比其父模型之一具有更高的精度和更低的标记消耗。

Conclusion: 该研究首次全面分析了这一可调节空间，为创建具有特定推理配置的LLM以满足多样化应用需求提供了实用指南。

Abstract: The growing demand for large language models (LLMs) with tunable reasoning
capabilities in many real-world applications highlights a critical need for
methods that can efficiently produce a spectrum of models balancing reasoning
depth and computational cost. Model merging has emerged as a promising,
training-free technique to address this challenge by arithmetically combining
the weights of a general-purpose model with a specialized reasoning model.
While various merging techniques exist, their potential to create a spectrum of
models with fine-grained control over reasoning abilities remains largely
unexplored. This work presents a large-scale empirical study evaluating a range
of model merging techniques across multiple reasoning benchmarks. We
systematically vary merging strengths to construct accuracy-efficiency curves,
providing the first comprehensive view of the tunable performance landscape.
Our findings reveal that model merging offers an effective and controllable
method for calibrating the trade-off between reasoning accuracy and token
efficiency, even when parent models have highly divergent weight spaces.
Crucially, we identify instances of Pareto Improvement, where a merged model
achieves both higher accuracy and lower token consumption than one of its
parents. Our study provides the first comprehensive analysis of this tunable
space, offering practical guidelines for creating LLMs with specific reasoning
profiles to meet diverse application demands.

Motivation: 现有大型推理模型在单次尝试中的表现与其潜在能力之间存在显著差距，需要通过多路径推理来充分挖掘模型的内在潜力。

Method: 采用两阶段推理框架：探索器模型并行生成多个潜在解决方案，合成器模型整合这些参考进行精炼推理，实现计算资源的正交扩展。

Conclusion: A2R不仅是性能提升框架，更是现实应用中的高效实用解决方案，有效弥合模型潜力与实际表现之间的差距。

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models have achieved significant improvements in
complex task-solving capabilities by allocating more computation at the
inference stage with a "thinking longer" paradigm. Even as the foundational
reasoning capabilities of models advance rapidly, the persistent gap between a
model's performance in a single attempt and its latent potential, often
revealed only across multiple solution paths, starkly highlights the disparity
between its realized and inherent capabilities. To address this, we present
A2R, an Asymmetric Two-Stage Reasoning framework designed to explicitly bridge
the gap between a model's potential and its actual performance. In this
framework, an "explorer" model first generates potential solutions in parallel
through repeated sampling. Subsequently,a "synthesizer" model integrates these
references for a more refined, second stage of reasoning. This two-stage
process allows computation to be scaled orthogonally to existing sequential
methods. Our work makes two key innovations: First, we present A2R as a
plug-and-play parallel reasoning framework that explicitly enhances a model's
capabilities on complex questions. For example, using our framework, the
Qwen3-8B-distill model achieves a 75% performance improvement compared to its
self-consistency baseline. Second, through a systematic analysis of the
explorer and synthesizer roles, we identify an effective asymmetric scaling
paradigm. This insight leads to A2R-Efficient, a "small-to-big" variant that
combines a Qwen3-4B explorer with a Qwen3-8B synthesizer. This configuration
surpasses the average performance of a monolithic Qwen3-32B model at a nearly
30% lower cost. Collectively, these results show that A2R is not only a
performance-boosting framework but also an efficient and practical solution for
real-world applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种支持标准多目标搜索算法的广义问题表述，通过聚合函数优化隐藏目标，在多个机器人规划问题中显著优于无目标聚合的算法版本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实机器人系统需要同时平衡多个冲突目标，但现有复杂目标交互的问题表述无法直接使用现成的先进多目标搜索算法。

Method: 提出广义问题表述，通过聚合函数优化隐藏目标，只需适当扩展核心操作以反映特定聚合函数，即可应用标准多目标搜索算法。

Result: 在导航、操作、医疗系统障碍不确定性规划、检查规划和路线规划等多个机器人规划问题中，扩展后的算法比无目标聚合版本性能提升数个数量级。

Conclusion: 该广义问题表述支持标准多目标搜索算法的应用，通过适当扩展核心操作，能够在复杂机器人规划问题中实现显著性能提升。

Abstract: Multi-objective search (MOS) has become essential in robotics, as real-world
robotic systems need to simultaneously balance multiple, often conflicting
objectives. Recent works explore complex interactions between objectives,
leading to problem formulations that do not allow the usage of out-of-the-box
state-of-the-art MOS algorithms. In this paper, we suggest a generalized
problem formulation that optimizes solution objectives via aggregation
functions of hidden (search) objectives. We show that our formulation supports
the application of standard MOS algorithms, necessitating only to properly
extend several core operations to reflect the specific aggregation functions
employed. We demonstrate our approach in several diverse robotics planning
problems, spanning motion-planning for navigation, manipulation and planning fr
medical systems under obstacle uncertainty as well as inspection planning, and
route planning with different road types. We solve the problems using
state-of-the-art MOS algorithms after properly extending their core operations,
and provide empirical evidence that they outperform by orders of magnitude the
vanilla versions of the algorithms applied to the same problems but without
objective aggregation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI快速发展带来的环境影响日益显著，现有能耗估算工具虽然易于使用，但存在假设简化和忽略重要因素的问题，需要验证其估算准确性。

Method: 通过比较静态和动态能耗估算方法与真实测量数据，在数百个AI实验中系统评估估算可靠性，并建立验证框架。

Result: 现有估算方法总体上能反映AI能耗模式，但持续存在高达40%的误差，需要提高估算准确性。

Conclusion: 本研究为AI可持续发展提供了能耗估算质量的实证证据，验证了广泛使用的工具，并提出了改进指南和可扩展的验证代码，对资源感知的ML和AI可持续性研究做出重要贡献。

Abstract: Although machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) present
fascinating opportunities for innovation, their rapid development is also
significantly impacting our environment. In response to growing
resource-awareness in the field, quantification tools such as the ML Emissions
Calculator and CodeCarbon were developed to estimate the energy consumption and
carbon emissions of running AI models. They are easy to incorporate into AI
projects, however also make pragmatic assumptions and neglect important
factors, raising the question of estimation accuracy. This study systematically
evaluates the reliability of static and dynamic energy estimation approaches
through comparisons with ground-truth measurements across hundreds of AI
experiments. Based on the proposed validation framework, investigative insights
into AI energy demand and estimation inaccuracies are provided. While generally
following the patterns of AI energy consumption, the established estimation
approaches are shown to consistently make errors of up to 40%. By providing
empirical evidence on energy estimation quality and errors, this study
establishes transparency and validates widely used tools for sustainable AI
development. It moreover formulates guidelines for improving the
state-of-the-art and offers code for extending the validation to other domains
and tools, thus making important contributions to resource-aware ML and AI
sustainability research.

*Seoyoung Lee,Seonbin Yoon,Seongbeen Lee,Hyesoo Kim,Joo Yong Sim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Log2Plan是一个结合结构化两级规划框架和用户行为日志任务挖掘的GUI任务自动化系统，解决了现有LLM/VLM代理的脆弱泛化、高延迟和有限长时程连贯性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM或VLM的规划-执行代理在GUI自动化中存在脆弱泛化、高延迟和有限长时程连贯性问题，依赖单次推理或静态计划使其在UI变化或复杂任务下表现脆弱。

Method: Log2Plan采用结构化两级规划框架：高层规划将用户命令映射到结构化任务字典，实现一致可泛化的自动化；通过用户行为日志挖掘识别用户特定模式；低层规划基于实时GUI上下文将高层计划转化为具体动作序列。

Result: 在200个真实世界任务上的评估显示，Log2Plan在任务成功率和执行时间方面均有显著提升，即使在长时程任务序列中也能保持超过60.0%的成功率。

Conclusion: Log2Plan通过结合结构化规划和任务挖掘方法，实现了鲁棒且可适应的GUI自动化，特别在复杂多步骤工作流中表现出色。

Abstract: GUI task automation streamlines repetitive tasks, but existing LLM or
VLM-based planner-executor agents suffer from brittle generalization, high
latency, and limited long-horizon coherence. Their reliance on single-shot
reasoning or static plans makes them fragile under UI changes or complex tasks.
Log2Plan addresses these limitations by combining a structured two-level
planning framework with a task mining approach over user behavior logs,
enabling robust and adaptable GUI automation. Log2Plan constructs high-level
plans by mapping user commands to a structured task dictionary, enabling
consistent and generalizable automation. To support personalization and reuse,
it employs a task mining approach from user behavior logs that identifies
user-specific patterns. These high-level plans are then grounded into low-level
action sequences by interpreting real-time GUI context, ensuring robust
execution across varying interfaces. We evaluated Log2Plan on 200 real-world
tasks, demonstrating significant improvements in task success rate and
execution time. Notably, it maintains over 60.0% success rate even on
long-horizon task sequences, highlighting its robustness in complex, multi-step
workflows.

TL;DR: 论文主张在机器学习评估中应明确考虑标注不确定性，使用直接操作分布的概率度量，而非简单的多数投票等聚合方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床数据集标签存在不确定性，标注者之间存在分歧且置信度不一致，传统聚合方法掩盖了这种变异性。

Method: 提出使用概率度量来评估模型，这些度量可以直接操作分布，适用于各种标注生成过程，包括简单计数、主观置信度评分或概率响应模型。

Result: 在医学影像基准测试的简单实验中，考虑二元标签的置信度显著影响模型排名。

Conclusion: 呼吁社区发布原始标注数据并采用不确定性感知评估，使性能估计能更好地反映临床数据特性。

Abstract: Clinical dataset labels are rarely certain as annotators disagree and
confidence is not uniform across cases. Typical aggregation procedures, such as
majority voting, obscure this variability. In simple experiments on medical
imaging benchmarks, accounting for the confidence in binary labels
significantly impacts model rankings. We therefore argue that machine-learning
evaluations should explicitly account for annotation uncertainty using
probabilistic metrics that directly operate on distributions. These metrics can
be applied independently of the annotations' generating process, whether
modeled by simple counting, subjective confidence ratings, or probabilistic
response models. They are also computationally lightweight, as closed-form
expressions have linear-time implementations once examples are sorted by model
score. We thus urge the community to release raw annotations for datasets and
to adopt uncertainty-aware evaluation so that performance estimates may better
reflect clinical data.

Abstract: This paper presents an evaluation framework for assessing Large Language
Models' (LLMs) capabilities in combinatorial optimization, specifically
addressing the 2D bin-packing problem. We introduce a systematic methodology
that combines LLMs with evolutionary algorithms to generate and refine
heuristic solutions iteratively. Through comprehensive experiments comparing
LLM generated heuristics against traditional approaches (Finite First-Fit and
Hybrid First-Fit), we demonstrate that LLMs can produce more efficient
solutions while requiring fewer computational resources. Our evaluation reveals
that GPT-4o achieves optimal solutions within two iterations, reducing average
bin usage from 16 to 15 bins while improving space utilization from 0.76-0.78
to 0.83. This work contributes to understanding LLM evaluation in specialized
domains and establishes benchmarks for assessing LLM performance in
combinatorial optimization tasks.

Conclusion: 通过解决数据质量、训练效率和领域专业知识提取等关键挑战，为医疗保健领域更可靠有效的AI驱动解决方案铺平了道路。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable potential in
various domains, yet their application in the medical field is hindered by
several challenges. General-purpose MLLMs often lack the specialized knowledge
required for medical tasks, leading to uncertain or hallucinatory responses.
Knowledge distillation from advanced models struggles to capture
domain-specific expertise in radiology and pharmacology. Additionally, the
computational cost of continual pretraining with large-scale medical data poses
significant efficiency challenges. To address these issues, we propose
InfiMed-Foundation-1.7B and InfiMed-Foundation-4B, two medical-specific MLLMs
designed to deliver state-of-the-art performance in medical applications. We
combined high-quality general-purpose and medical multimodal data and proposed
a novel five-dimensional quality assessment framework to curate high-quality
multimodal medical datasets. We employ low-to-high image resolution and
multimodal sequence packing to enhance training efficiency, enabling the
integration of extensive medical data. Furthermore, a three-stage supervised
fine-tuning process ensures effective knowledge extraction for complex medical
tasks. Evaluated on the MedEvalKit framework, InfiMed-Foundation-1.7B
outperforms Qwen2.5VL-3B, while InfiMed-Foundation-4B surpasses HuatuoGPT-V-7B
and MedGemma-27B-IT, demonstrating superior performance in medical visual
question answering and diagnostic tasks. By addressing key challenges in data
quality, training efficiency, and domain-specific knowledge extraction, our
work paves the way for more reliable and effective AI-driven solutions in
healthcare. InfiMed-Foundation-4B model is available at

*Aleksandar Terzić,Nicolas Menet,Michael Hersche,Thomas Hofmann,Abbas Rahimi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出PD-SSM方法，通过结构化稀疏参数化状态空间模型的转移矩阵，在保持计算效率的同时实现最优表达能力，能够模拟任意有限状态自动机。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代状态空间模型使用对角化转移矩阵虽然计算高效但表达能力受限，而无结构转移矩阵虽然表达能力最优但计算和内存成本过高。需要找到平衡计算效率和表达能力的方法。

Method: 将转移矩阵参数化为列独热矩阵(P)和复值对角矩阵(D)的乘积，使并行扫描的计算成本与状态大小呈线性关系。

Result: 理论上模型是BIBO稳定的，能够用一层维度N和线性读出层模拟任意N状态FSA；实验上在各种FSA状态跟踪任务中显著优于现代SSM变体，在时间序列分类中性能与神经控制微分方程相当。

Conclusion: PD-SSM在保持计算效率的同时实现了最优表达能力，能够有效跟踪复杂FSA状态，为状态空间模型提供了新的结构化参数化方法。

Abstract: Modern state-space models (SSMs) often utilize transition matrices which
enable efficient computation but pose restrictions on the model's expressivity,
as measured in terms of the ability to emulate finite-state automata (FSA).
While unstructured transition matrices are optimal in terms of expressivity,
they come at a prohibitively high compute and memory cost even for moderate
state sizes. We propose a structured sparse parametrization of transition
matrices in SSMs that enables FSA state tracking with optimal state size and
depth, while keeping the computational cost of the recurrence comparable to
that of diagonal SSMs. Our method, PD-SSM, parametrizes the transition matrix
as the product of a column one-hot matrix ($P$) and a complex-valued diagonal
matrix ($D$). Consequently, the computational cost of parallel scans scales
linearly with the state size. Theoretically, the model is BIBO-stable and can
emulate any $N$-state FSA with one layer of dimension $N$ and a linear readout
of size $N \times N$, significantly improving on all current structured SSM
guarantees. Experimentally, the model significantly outperforms a wide
collection of modern SSM variants on various FSA state tracking tasks. On
multiclass time-series classification, the performance is comparable to that of
neural controlled differential equations, a paradigm explicitly built for
time-series analysis. Finally, we integrate PD-SSM into a hybrid
Transformer-SSM architecture and demonstrate that the model can effectively
track the states of a complex FSA in which transitions are encoded as a set of
variable-length English sentences. The code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种更简单的基于LLM预期解释的反事实生成方法，将LLM表示为非确定性因果模型，相比现有方法更直接适用于任何黑盒LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对LLM的解释存在歧义，既不是字面解释也不是预期解释，需要一种更简单直接的反事实生成方法。

Method: 将LLM表示为非确定性因果模型，基于LLM的预期解释来生成反事实，这种方法对任何黑盒LLM都适用且无需修改。

Result: 新方法比现有方法更简单，直接适用于任何黑盒LLM，而现有方法只适用于特定类型的反事实生成。

Conclusion: 为LLM反事实推理提供了理论基础，为特定应用的反事实生成方法奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent work by Chatzi et al. and Ravfogel et al. has developed, for the first
time, a method for generating counterfactuals of probabilistic Large Language
Models. Such counterfactuals tell us what would - or might - have been the
output of an LLM if some factual prompt ${\bf x}$ had been ${\bf x}^*$ instead.
The ability to generate such counterfactuals is an important necessary step
towards explaining, evaluating, and comparing, the behavior of LLMs. I argue,
however, that the existing method rests on an ambiguous interpretation of LLMs:
it does not interpret LLMs literally, for the method involves the assumption
that one can change the implementation of an LLM's sampling process without
changing the LLM itself, nor does it interpret LLMs as intended, for the method
involves explicitly representing a nondeterministic LLM as a deterministic
causal model. I here present a much simpler method for generating
counterfactuals that is based on an LLM's intended interpretation by
representing it as a nondeterministic causal model instead. The advantage of my
simpler method is that it is directly applicable to any black-box LLM without
modification, as it is agnostic to any implementation details. The advantage of
the existing method, on the other hand, is that it directly implements the
generation of a specific type of counterfactuals that is useful for certain
purposes, but not for others. I clarify how both methods relate by offering a
theoretical foundation for reasoning about counterfactuals in LLMs based on
their intended semantics, thereby laying the groundwork for novel
application-specific methods for generating counterfactuals.

Motivation: 受《思考，快与慢》中人类双过程认知理论的启发，旨在让LLM更接近人类认知过程，提高在复杂推理任务中的效率和准确性。

Method: 采用多智能体设计：首先由快速思考智能体（System 1）生成快速答案，如果检测到不确定性，则触发包含规划、假设生成、检索、信息整合和决策等专门智能体的System 2推理管道。

Result: 实验结果表明，使用LLaMA 3模型的PRIME框架在需要多跳和知识基础推理的基准测试中，能够与GPT-4和GPT-4o等最先进闭源模型竞争。

Conclusion: PRIME为改进LLM在需要复杂、知识密集型推理领域的性能提供了一个可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition from \textit{Thinking,
Fast and Slow}, we introduce \textbf{PRIME} (Planning and Retrieval-Integrated
Memory for Enhanced Reasoning), a multi-agent reasoning framework that
dynamically integrates \textbf{System 1} (fast, intuitive thinking) and
\textbf{System 2} (slow, deliberate thinking). PRIME first employs a Quick
Thinking Agent (System 1) to generate a rapid answer; if uncertainty is
detected, it then triggers a structured System 2 reasoning pipeline composed of
specialized agents for \textit{planning}, \textit{hypothesis generation},
\textit{retrieval}, \textit{information integration}, and
\textit{decision-making}. This multi-agent design faithfully mimics human
cognitive processes and enhances both efficiency and accuracy. Experimental
results with LLaMA 3 models demonstrate that PRIME enables open-source LLMs to
perform competitively with state-of-the-art closed-source models like GPT-4 and
GPT-4o on benchmarks requiring multi-hop and knowledge-grounded reasoning. This
research establishes PRIME as a scalable solution for improving LLMs in domains
requiring complex, knowledge-intensive reasoning.

Motivation: 收集大规模真实机器人操作数据成本高昂且耗时，限制了VLA模型的泛化能力。

Method: 使用DreamTransfer框架生成多视角一致的机器人操作视频，结合AdaMix硬样本感知训练策略动态调整训练权重。

Result: 生成的视频在多视角一致性、几何保真度和文本条件准确性方面优于现有方法；在零样本视觉域任务中，相比仅使用真实数据训练，性能提升超过200%。

Conclusion: EMMA框架通过生成数据和有效训练策略，显著提升了VLA模型在机器人操作任务中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models increasingly rely on diverse training
data to achieve robust generalization. However, collecting large-scale
real-world robot manipulation data across varied object appearances and
environmental conditions remains prohibitively time-consuming and expensive. To
overcome this bottleneck, we propose Embodied Manipulation Media Adaptation
(EMMA), a VLA policy enhancement framework that integrates a generative data
engine with an effective training pipeline. We introduce DreamTransfer, a
diffusion Transformer-based framework for generating multi-view consistent,
geometrically grounded embodied manipulation videos. DreamTransfer enables
text-controlled visual editing of robot videos, transforming foreground,
background, and lighting conditions without compromising 3D structure or
geometrical plausibility. Furthermore, we explore hybrid training with real and
generated data, and introduce AdaMix, a hard-sample-aware training strategy
that dynamically reweights training batches to focus optimization on
perceptually or kinematically challenging samples. Extensive experiments show
that videos generated by DreamTransfer significantly outperform prior video
generation methods in multi-view consistency, geometric fidelity, and
text-conditioning accuracy. Crucially, VLAs trained with generated data enable
robots to generalize to unseen object categories and novel visual domains using
only demonstrations from a single appearance. In real-world robotic
manipulation tasks with zero-shot visual domains, our approach achieves over a
200% relative performance gain compared to training on real data alone, and
further improves by 13% with AdaMix, demonstrating its effectiveness in
boosting policy generalization.

Result: 实验结果显示，EST促进更大的视觉新颖性，而ETT培养更连贯和可解释的进化序列。

Conclusion: ASAL++为基础模型驱动的人工生命发现指出了具有开放式特征的新方向。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have recently opened up new frontiers in the field of
artificial life (ALife) by providing powerful tools to automate search through
ALife simulations. Previous work aligns ALife simulations with natural language
target prompts using vision-language models (VLMs). We build on Automated
Search for Artificial Life (ASAL) by introducing ASAL++, a method for
open-ended-like search guided by multimodal FMs. We use a second FM to propose
new evolutionary targets based on a simulation's visual history. This induces
an evolutionary trajectory with increasingly complex targets.
  We explore two strategies: (1) evolving a simulation to match a single new
prompt at each iteration (Evolved Supervised Targets: EST) and (2) evolving a
simulation to match the entire sequence of generated prompts (Evolved Temporal
Targets: ETT). We test our method empirically in the Lenia substrate using
Gemma-3 to propose evolutionary targets, and show that EST promotes greater
visual novelty, while ETT fosters more coherent and interpretable evolutionary
sequences.
  Our results suggest that ASAL++ points towards new directions for FM-driven
ALife discovery with open-ended characteristics.

TL;DR: GeoSketch是一个神经符号框架，将几何推理转化为交互式的感知-推理-行动循环，通过动态操作图表来解决几何问题，显著优于静态感知方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型将图表作为静态图像处理，缺乏动态操作能力，而动态操作（如辅助线构造和仿射变换）是人类几何推理的核心方面。

Method: GeoSketch包含三个模块：感知模块将图表抽象为结构化逻辑形式，符号推理模块应用几何定理决定下一个演绎步骤，草图操作模块执行绘制辅助线或应用变换等操作。采用两阶段训练：在2000个符号策划轨迹上进行监督微调，然后通过强化学习增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在GeoSketch基准测试（包含390个需要辅助构造或仿射变换的几何问题）上的实验表明，GeoSketch显著提高了逐步推理准确性和问题解决成功率。

Conclusion: GeoSketch通过统一分层决策、可执行视觉动作和符号验证，将多模态推理从静态解释推进到动态可验证交互，为复杂视觉空间问题解决建立了新基础。

Abstract: Geometric Problem Solving (GPS) poses a unique challenge for Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs), requiring not only the joint interpretation of text
and diagrams but also iterative visuospatial reasoning. While existing
approaches process diagrams as static images, they lack the capacity for
dynamic manipulation - a core aspect of human geometric reasoning involving
auxiliary line construction and affine transformations. We present GeoSketch, a
neural-symbolic framework that recasts geometric reasoning as an interactive
perception-reasoning-action loop. GeoSketch integrates: (1) a Perception module
that abstracts diagrams into structured logic forms, (2) a Symbolic Reasoning
module that applies geometric theorems to decide the next deductive step, and
(3) a Sketch Action module that executes operations such as drawing auxiliary
lines or applying transformations, thereby updating the diagram in a closed
loop. To train this agent, we develop a two-stage pipeline: supervised
fine-tuning on 2,000 symbolic-curated trajectories followed by reinforcement
learning with dense, symbolic rewards to enhance robustness and strategic
exploration. To evaluate this paradigm, we introduce the GeoSketch Benchmark, a
high-quality set of 390 geometry problems requiring auxiliary construction or
affine transformations. Experiments on strong MLLM baselines demonstrate that
GeoSketch significantly improves stepwise reasoning accuracy and
problem-solving success over static perception methods. By unifying
hierarchical decision-making, executable visual actions, and symbolic
verification, GeoSketch advances multimodal reasoning from static
interpretation to dynamic, verifiable interaction, establishing a new
foundation for solving complex visuospatial problems.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in organizing and executing complex tasks, and many such agents are now widely
used in various application scenarios. However, developing these agents
requires carefully designed workflows, carefully crafted prompts, and iterative
tuning, which requires LLM techniques and domain-specific expertise. These
hand-crafted limitations hinder the scalability and cost-effectiveness of LLM
agents across a wide range of industries. To address these challenges, we
propose \textbf{InfiAgent}, a Pyramid-like DAG-based Multi-Agent Framework that
can be applied to \textbf{infi}nite scenarios, which introduces several key
innovations: a generalized "agent-as-a-tool" mechanism that automatically
decomposes complex agents into hierarchical multi-agent systems; a dual-audit
mechanism that ensures the quality and stability of task completion; an agent
routing function that enables efficient task-agent matching; and an agent
self-evolution mechanism that autonomously restructures the agent DAG based on
new tasks, poor performance, or optimization opportunities. Furthermore,
InfiAgent's atomic task design supports agent parallelism, significantly
improving execution efficiency. This framework evolves into a versatile
pyramid-like multi-agent system capable of solving a wide range of problems.
Evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that InfiAgent achieves 9.9\%
higher performance compared to ADAS (similar auto-generated agent framework),
while a case study of the AI research assistant InfiHelper shows that it
generates scientific papers that have received recognition from human reviewers
at top-tier IEEE conferences.

### [250] [Estimating the Empowerment of Language Model Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22504)
*Jinyeop Song,Jeff Gore,Max Kleiman-Weiner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了基于信息论中赋权概念（行动与未来状态的互信息）的开放评估方法EELMA，用于评估语言模型代理的能力，无需人工设计具体任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型代理能力增强并广泛使用真实工具，需要可扩展的评估框架。传统基准评估成本高且需要人工设计任务。

Method: 提出EELMA算法，通过多轮文本交互近似估计有效赋权，在语言游戏和真实网页浏览场景中验证。

Result: 赋权与平均任务性能强相关，能表征环境复杂性、思维链、模型规模和记忆长度等因素的影响，高赋权状态通常是关键能力时刻。

Conclusion: 赋权是评估复杂开放环境中语言模型代理的有吸引力的通用指标。

Abstract: As language model (LM) agents become more capable and gain broader access to
real-world tools, there is a growing need for scalable evaluation frameworks of
agentic capability. However, conventional benchmark-centric evaluations are
costly to design and require human designers to come up with valid tasks that
translate into insights about general model capabilities. In this work, we
propose information-theoretic evaluation based on empowerment, the mutual
information between an agent's actions and future states, as an open-ended
method for evaluating LM agents. We introduce EELMA (Estimating Empowerment of
Language Model Agents), an algorithm for approximating effective empowerment
from multi-turn text interactions. We validate EELMA on both language games and
scaled-up realistic web-browsing scenarios. We find that empowerment strongly
correlates with average task performance, characterize the impact of
environmental complexity and agentic factors such as chain-of-thought, model
scale, and memory length on estimated empowerment, and that high empowerment
states and actions are often pivotal moments for general capabilities.
Together, these results demonstrate empowerment as an appealing general-purpose
metric for evaluating and monitoring LM agents in complex, open-ended settings.

Abstract: This paper introduces TrueGradeAI, an AI-driven digital examination framework
designed to overcome the shortcomings of traditional paper-based assessments,
including excessive paper usage, logistical complexity, grading delays, and
evaluator bias. The system preserves natural handwriting by capturing stylus
input on secure tablets and applying transformer-based optical character
recognition for transcription. Evaluation is conducted through a
retrieval-augmented pipeline that integrates faculty solutions, cache layers,
and external references, enabling a large language model to assign scores with
explicit, evidence-linked reasoning. Unlike prior tablet-based exam systems
that primarily digitize responses, TrueGradeAI advances the field by
incorporating explainable automation, bias mitigation, and auditable grading
trails. By uniting handwriting preservation with scalable and transparent
evaluation, the framework reduces environmental costs, accelerates feedback
cycles, and progressively builds a reusable knowledge base, while actively
working to mitigate grading bias and ensure fairness in assessment.

*Bo Li,Guanzhi Deng,Ronghao Chen,Junrong Yue,Shuo Zhang,Qinghua Zhao,Linqi Song,Lijie Wen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了REMA框架，通过分析语言模型内部表示在推理流形上的几何偏差来解释推理失败的原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大语言模型如何进行复杂推理及其失败机制是解释性研究的挑战，需要可测量的几何分析视角。

Method: 定义推理流形概念，构建REMA框架，通过计算错误表示与正确推理流形的k近邻距离来量化几何偏差，并在模型各层跟踪这些偏差以定位发散点。

Result: 实验证明推理流形的低维特性，以及错误与正确推理表示之间的高度可分性，验证了REMA框架在分析推理失败起源方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究将抽象推理失败与表示中的可测量几何偏差联系起来，为深入理解和诊断黑盒模型的内部计算过程提供了新途径。

Abstract: Understanding how Large Language Models (LLMs) perform complex reasoning and
their failure mechanisms is a challenge in interpretability research. To
provide a measurable geometric analysis perspective, we define the concept of
the Reasoning Manifold, a latent low-dimensional geometric structure formed by
the internal representations corresponding to all correctly reasoned
generations. This structure can be conceptualized as the embodiment of the
effective thinking paths that the model has learned to successfully solve a
given task. Based on this concept, we build REMA, a framework that explains the
origins of failures by quantitatively comparing the spatial relationships of
internal model representations corresponding to both erroneous and correct
reasoning samples. Specifically, REMA first quantifies the geometric deviation
of each erroneous representation by calculating its k-nearest neighbors
distance to the approximated manifold formed by correct representations,
thereby providing a unified failure signal. It then localizes the divergence
points where these deviations first become significant by tracking this
deviation metric across the model's layers and comparing it against a baseline
of internal fluctuations from correct representations, thus identifying where
the reasoning chain begins to go off-track. Our extensive experiments on
diverse language and multimodal models and tasks demonstrate the
low-dimensional nature of the reasoning manifold and the high separability
between erroneous and correct reasoning representations. The results also
validate the effectiveness of the REMA framework in analyzing the origins of
reasoning failures. This research connects abstract reasoning failures to
measurable geometric deviations in representations, providing new avenues for
in-depth understanding and diagnosis of the internal computational processes of
black-box models.

### [253] [The Emergence of Altruism in Large-Language-Model Agents Society](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22537)
*Haoyang Li,Xiao Jia,Zhanzhan Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究通过Schelling变体城市迁移模型，在200多个LLM智能体社会中首次揭示了不同大语言模型在利己和利他倾向上的内在异质性，识别出"适应性利己主义者"和"利他优化者"两种社会行动逻辑原型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注小规模任务导向游戏中的合作行为，忽视了大规模智能体社会中利他主义如何涌现，需要理解LLM智能体所体现的社会逻辑。

Method: 引入Schelling变体城市迁移模型，创建社会困境，让200多个LLM智能体在利己（个人效用）和利他（系统效用）目标间导航，并采用基于扎根理论的方法系统编码智能体推理。

Result: 发现LLM存在根本性的社会倾向差异："适应性利己主义者"默认优先考虑自身利益，但在社会规范设置信息板影响下利他行为显著增加；"利他优化者"表现出固有的利他逻辑，即使直接损害自身利益也始终优先考虑集体利益。

Conclusion: 对于社会模拟，模型选择不仅是选择推理能力，更是选择内在的社会行动逻辑。"适应性利己主义者"更适合模拟复杂人类社会，"利他优化者"更适合模拟理想化的亲社会行为者或集体福利为主要考量的场景。

Abstract: Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for social simulation is a frontier
in computational social science. Understanding the social logics these agents
embody is critical to this attempt. However, existing research has primarily
focused on cooperation in small-scale, task-oriented games, overlooking how
altruism, which means sacrificing self-interest for collective benefit, emerges
in large-scale agent societies. To address this gap, we introduce a
Schelling-variant urban migration model that creates a social dilemma,
compelling over 200 LLM agents to navigate an explicit conflict between
egoistic (personal utility) and altruistic (system utility) goals. Our central
finding is a fundamental difference in the social tendencies of LLMs. We
identify two distinct archetypes: "Adaptive Egoists", which default to
prioritizing self-interest but whose altruistic behaviors significantly
increase under the influence of a social norm-setting message board; and
"Altruistic Optimizers", which exhibit an inherent altruistic logic,
consistently prioritizing collective benefit even at a direct cost to
themselves. Furthermore, to qualitatively analyze the cognitive underpinnings
of these decisions, we introduce a method inspired by Grounded Theory to
systematically code agent reasoning. In summary, this research provides the
first evidence of intrinsic heterogeneity in the egoistic and altruistic
tendencies of different LLMs. We propose that for social simulation, model
selection is not merely a matter of choosing reasoning capability, but of
choosing an intrinsic social action logic. While "Adaptive Egoists" may offer a
more suitable choice for simulating complex human societies, "Altruistic
Optimizers" are better suited for modeling idealized pro-social actors or
scenarios where collective welfare is the primary consideration.

*Chenyu Zhou,Tianyi Xu,Jianghao Lin,Dongdong Ge*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: StepORLM是一个自进化的LLM框架，通过生成式过程监督解决运筹学问题，在6个基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法面临两个关键限制：结果奖励存在信用分配问题，正确的最终答案可能强化有缺陷的推理；传统的判别式过程监督是短视的，无法全面评估运筹学建模的相互依赖步骤。

Method: StepORLM采用协同进化循环，策略模型和生成式过程奖励模型(GenPRM)相互迭代改进。通过双反馈机制：来自外部求解器的确定性结果验证，以及来自GenPRM的细致全面过程评估。使用加权直接偏好优化(W-DPO)对齐策略，同时优化GenPRM。

Result: 8B参数的StepORLM在6个基准测试中建立了新的最先进水平，显著优于更大的通用模型、代理方法和专业基线。协同进化的GenPRM能够作为强大且普遍适用的过程验证器，大幅提升自身模型和其他现有LLM的推理扩展性能。

Conclusion: StepORLM通过生成式过程监督和协同进化框架，有效解决了运筹学问题中的信用分配和过程评估问题，为LLM在运筹学领域的应用提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities for solving
Operations Research (OR) problems. While reinforcement learning serves as a
powerful paradigm for LLM training on OR problems, existing works generally
face two key limitations. First, outcome reward suffers from the credit
assignment problem, where correct final answers can reinforce flawed reasoning.
Second, conventional discriminative process supervision is myopic, failing to
evaluate the interdependent steps of OR modeling holistically. To this end, we
introduce StepORLM, a novel self-evolving framework with generative process
supervision. At its core, StepORLM features a co-evolutionary loop where a
policy model and a generative process reward model (GenPRM) iteratively improve
on each other. This loop is driven by a dual-feedback mechanism: definitive,
outcome-based verification from an external solver, and nuanced, holistic
process evaluation from the GenPRM. The combined signal is used to align the
policy via Weighted Direct Preference Optimization (W-DPO) and simultaneously
refine the GenPRM. Our resulting 8B-parameter StepORLM establishes a new
state-of-the-art across six benchmarks, significantly outperforming vastly
larger generalist models, agentic methods, and specialized baselines. Moreover,
the co-evolved GenPRM is able to act as a powerful and universally applicable
process verifier, substantially boosting the inference scaling performance of
both our own model and other existing LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UniMIC是一个统一的基于令牌的多模态交互编码框架，通过使用紧凑的令牌化表示作为通信媒介，在保持与大型多模态模型兼容的同时实现高效的低比特率传输。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有编解码器仍针对单模态单向通信优化，在传统的压缩-传输-重建管道中会导致重复的性能下降，无法满足多模态人机交互的需求。

Method: 采用紧凑令牌化表示作为通信媒介，结合轻量级Transformer熵模型（通用、掩码和文本条件化设计）来最小化令牌间冗余。

Result: 在文本到图像生成、文本引导修复、外推和视觉问答等任务中，UniMIC实现了显著的比特率节省，即使在超低比特率（<0.05bpp）下仍保持鲁棒性，且不影响下游任务性能。

Conclusion: UniMIC为下一代多模态交互通信建立了一个实用且前瞻的范式。

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and cloud-based AI
agents is transforming human-AI collaboration into bidirectional, multimodal
interaction. However, existing codecs remain optimized for unimodal, one-way
communication, resulting in repeated degradation under conventional
compress-transmit-reconstruct pipelines. To address this limitation, we propose
UniMIC, a Unified token-based Multimodal Interactive Coding framework that
bridges edge devices and cloud AI agents. Instead of transmitting raw pixels or
plain text, UniMIC employs compact tokenized representations as the
communication medium, enabling efficient low-bitrate transmission while
maintaining compatibility with LMMs. To further enhance compression,
lightweight Transformer-based entropy models with scenario-specific
designs-generic, masked, and text-conditioned-effectively minimize inter-token
redundancy. Extensive experiments on text-to-image generation, text-guided
inpainting, outpainting, and visual question answering show that UniMIC
achieves substantial bitrate savings and remains robust even at ultra-low
bitrates (<0.05bpp), without compromising downstream task performance. These
results establish UniMIC as a practical and forward-looking paradigm for
next-generation multimodal interactive communication.

*Yixuan Han,Fan Ma,Ruijie Quan,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Dynamic Experts Search (DES)方法，通过动态调整MoE模型中激活的专家数量来增强推理能力，无需额外成本即可提高准确性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时缩放方法主要依赖输出级采样，忽视了模型架构的作用。在MoE模型中，发现改变激活专家数量可以产生互补的解决方案集，这揭示了一个未被充分探索的多样性来源。

Method: DES包含两个关键组件：Dynamic MoE（在推理时直接控制专家数量生成多样化推理轨迹）和Expert Configuration Inheritance（在推理路径内保持一致的专家数量，在运行间变化以平衡稳定性和多样性）。

Result: 在MoE架构、验证器和推理基准测试（数学、代码和知识）上的广泛实验表明，DES可靠地优于TTS基线方法，在不增加成本的情况下提高了准确性和稳定性。

Conclusion: DES是一种实用且可扩展的架构感知TTS方法，展示了现代LLMs中结构灵活性如何推进推理能力的发展。

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) enhances the reasoning ability of large language
models (LLMs) by allocating additional computation during inference. However,
existing approaches primarily rely on output-level sampling while overlooking
the role of model architecture. In mainstream Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs, we
observe that varying the number of activated experts yields complementary
solution sets with stable accuracy, revealing a new and underexplored source of
diversity. Motivated by this observation, we propose Dynamic Experts Search
(DES), a TTS strategy that elevates expert activation into a controllable
dimension of the search space. DES integrates two key components: (1) Dynamic
MoE, which enables direct control of expert counts during inference to generate
diverse reasoning trajectories without additional cost; and (2) Expert
Configuration Inheritance, which preserves consistent expert counts within a
reasoning path while varying them across runs, thereby balancing stability and
diversity throughout the search. Extensive experiments across MoE
architectures, verifiers and reasoning benchmarks (i.e., math, code and
knowledge) demonstrate that DES reliably outperforms TTS baselines, enhancing
accuracy and stability without additional cost. These results highlight DES as
a practical and scalable form of architecture-aware TTS, illustrating how
structural flexibility in modern LLMs can advance reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文通过图论抽象分析强化学习在LLM规划中的理论机制，发现RL通过探索解决SFT引入的伪相关性问题，但策略梯度存在多样性崩溃问题，而Q学习能保持多样性且具有离策略学习优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RL方法显著提升了LLM的规划能力，但其有效性缺乏理论解释，需要系统分析RL在LLM规划中的优势和局限。

Method: 采用基于图的可处理抽象模型，重点分析策略梯度和Q学习方法，并在Blocksworld真实规划基准上进行验证。

Result: SFT可能引入基于共现的伪解决方案，RL通过探索实现正确规划；策略梯度存在多样性崩溃问题，Q学习能保持多样性并具有离策略学习优势；需要精心设计奖励函数防止Q学习中的奖励破解。

Conclusion: RL通过探索机制提升LLM规划泛化能力，但不同RL算法各有优劣，Q学习在多样性保持方面优于策略梯度，且奖励设计对算法性能至关重要。

Abstract: Recent reinforcement learning (RL) methods have substantially enhanced the
planning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the theoretical
basis for their effectiveness remains elusive. In this work, we investigate
RL's benefits and limitations through a tractable graph-based abstraction,
focusing on policy gradient (PG) and Q-learning methods. Our theoretical
analyses reveal that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) may introduce
co-occurrence-based spurious solutions, whereas RL achieves correct planning
primarily through exploration, underscoring exploration's role in enabling
better generalization. However, we also show that PG suffers from diversity
collapse, where output diversity decreases during training and persists even
after perfect accuracy is attained. By contrast, Q-learning provides two key
advantages: off-policy learning and diversity preservation at convergence. We
further demonstrate that careful reward design is necessary to prevent reward
hacking in Q-learning. Finally, applying our framework to the real-world
planning benchmark Blocksworld, we confirm that these behaviors manifest in
practice.

TL;DR: ControlHair是一个结合物理模拟器和条件视频扩散的混合框架，用于实现可控的动态头发渲染。它采用三阶段流程：物理参数编码、控制信号提取和视频生成，能够精确控制头发动力学。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频扩散模型虽然能生成高质量视频，但缺乏对头发动态的细粒度控制。头发模拟和渲染面临复杂的动力学、多样材质属性和光线-头发交互等挑战。

Method: 三阶段流程：1) 使用物理模拟器将物理参数（如头发刚度、风力）编码为逐帧几何；2) 提取逐帧控制信号；3) 将控制信号输入视频扩散模型生成具有所需头发动态的视频。这种级联设计将物理推理与视频生成解耦。

Result: 在精心策划的10K视频数据集上训练，ControlHair在文本和姿态条件基线方法上表现更优，能够提供精确控制的头发动态。展示了三个应用案例：动态发型试戴、子弹时间效果和电影图形效果。

Conclusion: ControlHair是首个基于物理信息的视频扩散框架，用于可控动态效果。该框架支持多样化的物理参数，并使视频扩散模型的训练变得容易。

Abstract: Hair simulation and rendering are challenging due to complex strand dynamics,
diverse material properties, and intricate light-hair interactions. Recent
video diffusion models can generate high-quality videos, but they lack
fine-grained control over hair dynamics. We present ControlHair, a hybrid
framework that integrates a physics simulator with conditional video diffusion
to enable controllable dynamic hair rendering. ControlHair adopts a three-stage
pipeline: it first encodes physics parameters (e.g., hair stiffness, wind) into
per-frame geometry using a simulator, then extracts per-frame control signals,
and finally feeds control signals into a video diffusion model to generate
videos with desired hair dynamics. This cascaded design decouples physics
reasoning from video generation, supports diverse physics, and makes training
the video diffusion model easy. Trained on a curated 10K video dataset,
ControlHair outperforms text- and pose-conditioned baselines, delivering
precisely controlled hair dynamics. We further demonstrate three use cases of
ControlHair: dynamic hairstyle try-on, bullet-time effects, and cinemagraphic.
ControlHair introduces the first physics-informed video diffusion framework for
controllable dynamics. We provide a teaser video and experimental results on
our website.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS家族模型在功耗受限的XR设备上效率不高，这些设备需要在瓦特级别运行。

Method: 提出了一个通用问题公式化，通过识别显示和渲染功耗景观中的等质量曲线，并在给定曲线上找到功耗最小点来实现优化。支持注视点渲染以进一步节省功耗。

Result: 实验和用户研究表明，PowerGS相比最先进的3DGS模型实现了高达86%的总功耗降低，主观和客观质量损失最小。

Conclusion: PowerGS是第一个在3DGS中联合最小化渲染和显示功耗的框架，在功耗受限的XR设备上具有显著优势。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) combines classic image-based rendering,
pointbased graphics, and modern differentiable techniques, and offers an
interesting alternative to traditional physically-based rendering. 3DGS-family
models are far from efficient for power-constrained Extended Reality (XR)
devices, which need to operate at a Watt-level. This paper introduces PowerGS,
the first framework to jointly minimize the rendering and display power in 3DGS
under a quality constraint. We present a general problem formulation and show
that solving the problem amounts to 1) identifying the iso-quality curve(s) in
the landscape subtended by the display and rendering power and 2) identifying
the power-minimal point on a given curve, which has a closed-form solution
given a proper parameterization of the curves. PowerGS also readily supports
foveated rendering for further power savings. Extensive experiments and user
studies show that PowerGS achieves up to 86% total power reduction compared to
state-of-the-art 3DGS models, with minimal loss in both subjective and
objective quality. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖多视角视频来恢复变形，这在受限场景下适用性有限。需要开发从单张图像重建物体变形的技术。

Method: 提出两个主要技术：1）高斯到像素匹配，弥合3D高斯表示与2D像素观测之间的领域差距；2）刚性部分分割，包括初始化和细化，明确识别刚性区域以保持几何一致性。

Result: 实验表明该方法显著优于现有方法，并能自然扩展到帧插值和交互式物体操作等应用。

Conclusion: DeformSplat框架能够从单张图像重建一致的变形，解决了单图像变形重建的挑战，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Reconstructing object deformation from a single image remains a significant
challenge in computer vision and graphics. Existing methods typically rely on
multi-view video to recover deformation, limiting their applicability under
constrained scenarios. To address this, we propose DeformSplat, a novel
framework that effectively guides 3D Gaussian deformation from only a single
image. Our method introduces two main technical contributions. First, we
present Gaussian-to-Pixel Matching which bridges the domain gap between 3D
Gaussian representations and 2D pixel observations. This enables robust
deformation guidance from sparse visual cues. Second, we propose Rigid Part
Segmentation consisting of initialization and refinement. This segmentation
explicitly identifies rigid regions, crucial for maintaining geometric
coherence during deformation. By combining these two techniques, our approach
can reconstruct consistent deformations from a single image. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing
methods and naturally extends to various applications,such as frame
interpolation and interactive object manipulation.

Motivation: 当前城市场景重建技术往往忽视纹理质量，导致纹理模型出现明显视觉伪影。本文旨在解决在有限先验知识下同时捕获几何结构和纹理的问题。

Method: 生成高质量垂直俯视和水平平面视图来捕获几何和纹理细节；提出多目标优化策略联合优化纹理保真度、几何精度和采集成本；设计考虑纹理一致性的顺序路径规划算法。

Abstract: Recent advances in image acquisition and scene reconstruction have enabled
the generation of high-quality structural urban scene geometry, given
sufficient site information. However, current capture techniques often overlook
the crucial importance of texture quality, resulting in noticeable visual
artifacts in the textured models. In this work, we introduce the urban geometry
and texture co-capture problem under limited prior knowledge before a site
visit. The only inputs are a 2D building contour map of the target area and a
safe flying altitude above the buildings. We propose an innovative aerial path
planning framework designed to co-capture images for reconstructing both
structured geometry and high-fidelity textures. To evaluate and guide view
planning, we introduce a comprehensive texture quality assessment system,
including two novel metrics tailored for building facades. Firstly, our method
generates high-quality vertical dipping views and horizontal planar views to
effectively capture both geometric and textural details. A multi-objective
optimization strategy is then proposed to jointly maximize texture fidelity,
improve geometric accuracy, and minimize the cost associated with aerial views.
Furthermore, we present a sequential path planning algorithm that accounts for
texture consistency during image capture. Extensive experiments on large-scale
synthetic and real-world urban datasets demonstrate that our approach
effectively produces image sets suitable for concurrent geometric and texture
reconstruction, enabling the creation of realistic, textured scene proxies at
low operational cost.

Motivation: 多阶段长时程任务（如篮球动作）对强化学习方法具有挑战性，因为需要在技能间实现无缝的策略组合和过渡。现有方法在处理个体策略不共享显著共同探索状态或缺乏明确初始和终止状态的任务时存在困难。

Method: 引入策略集成框架来组合多阶段长时程任务中截然不同的运动技能，并进一步提出高层软路由机制，实现子任务间的无缝和鲁棒过渡。

Result: 在基础篮球技能和具有挑战性的过渡任务上评估该框架，训练的策略能有效控制模拟角色与球互动，完成由实时用户指令指定的长时程任务，且不依赖球轨迹参考。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了多阶段长时程任务中策略组合和过渡的挑战，实现了不同运动技能的无缝集成。

Abstract: Learning a control policy for a multi-phase, long-horizon task, such as
basketball maneuvers, remains challenging for reinforcement learning approaches
due to the need for seamless policy composition and transitions between skills.
A long-horizon task typically consists of distinct subtasks with well-defined
goals, separated by transitional subtasks with unclear goals but critical to
the success of the entire task. Existing methods like the mixture of experts
and skill chaining struggle with tasks where individual policies do not share
significant commonly explored states or lack well-defined initial and terminal
states between different phases. In this paper, we introduce a novel policy
integration framework to enable the composition of drastically different motor
skills in multi-phase long-horizon tasks with ill-defined intermediate states.
Based on that, we further introduce a high-level soft router to enable seamless
and robust transitions between the subtasks. We evaluate our framework on a set
of fundamental basketball skills and challenging transitions. Policies trained
by our approach can effectively control the simulated character to interact
with the ball and accomplish the long-horizon task specified by real-time user
commands, without relying on ball trajectory references.
