### [1] [Beyond CNNs: Efficient Fine-Tuning of Multi-Modal LLMs for Object Detection on Low-Data Regimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08589)
*Nirmal Elamon,Rouzbeh Davoudi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文比较了传统CNN、零样本多模态LLM和微调多模态LLM在图像中人工文本叠加检测任务上的表现，发现LLM仅需少量数据微调即可显著提升性能，甚至超越需要大量数据的CNN模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何充分发挥多模态大语言模型在视觉任务中的潜力，特别是在数据有限的情况下，通过微调实现优于传统CNN的性能，为跨模态学习提供高效策略。

Method: 对传统CNN、零样本预训练多模态LLM和微调多模态LLM进行综合比较，重点研究LLM在少量数据（少于1000张图像）上的微调效果。

Result: 微调后的多模态LLM在人工文本叠加检测任务上实现了高达36%的准确率提升，性能匹配甚至超越了需要大量数据的CNN基线模型。

Conclusion: LLM方法在目标检测任务中展现出卓越的适应性和数据效率，为低资源视觉环境下的多模态transformer应用提供了实用指导，证明了语言引导模型在精确视觉理解中的潜力。

Abstract: The field of object detection and understanding is rapidly evolving, driven
by advances in both traditional CNN-based models and emerging multi-modal large
language models (LLMs). While CNNs like ResNet and YOLO remain highly effective
for image-based tasks, recent transformer-based LLMs introduce new capabilities
such as dynamic context reasoning, language-guided prompts, and holistic scene
understanding. However, when used out-of-the-box, the full potential of LLMs
remains underexploited, often resulting in suboptimal performance on
specialized visual tasks. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison
of fine-tuned traditional CNNs, zero-shot pre-trained multi-modal LLMs, and
fine-tuned multi-modal LLMs on the challenging task of artificial text overlay
detection in images. A key contribution of our study is demonstrating that LLMs
can be effectively fine-tuned on very limited data (fewer than 1,000 images) to
achieve up to 36% accuracy improvement, matching or surpassing CNN-based
baselines that typically require orders of magnitude more data. By exploring
how language-guided models can be adapted for precise visual understanding with
minimal supervision, our work contributes to the broader effort of bridging
vision and language, offering novel insights into efficient cross-modal
learning strategies. These findings highlight the adaptability and data
efficiency of LLM-based approaches for real-world object detection tasks and
provide actionable guidance for applying multi-modal transformers in
low-resource visual environments. To support continued progress in this area,
we have made the code used to fine-tune the models available in our GitHub,
enabling future improvements and reuse in related applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑肿瘤分割在诊断和治疗规划中至关重要，但类别不平衡和模型泛化能力有限等问题阻碍了进展。

Method: 在公开MRI数据集上进行实验，使用U-Net架构，采用焦点损失函数，并评估了三种数据增强技术（水平翻转、旋转、缩放）的影响。

Result: 使用焦点损失的U-Net模型达到了90%的精确度，与最先进结果相当。

Conclusion: 通过公开所有代码和结果，本研究建立了一个透明、可重复的基线，为未来脑肿瘤分割中增强策略和损失函数设计的研究提供指导。

Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation is crucial for diagnosis and treatment planning, yet
challenges such as class imbalance and limited model generalization continue to
hinder progress. This work presents a reproducible evaluation of U-Net
segmentation performance on brain tumor MRI using focal loss and basic data
augmentation strategies. Experiments were conducted on a publicly available MRI
dataset, focusing on focal loss parameter tuning and assessing the impact of
three data augmentation techniques: horizontal flip, rotation, and scaling. The
U-Net with focal loss achieved a precision of 90%, comparable to
state-of-the-art results. By making all code and results publicly available,
this study establishes a transparent, reproducible baseline to guide future
research on augmentation strategies and loss function design in brain tumor
segmentation.

### [3] [Adjusting Initial Noise to Mitigate Memorization in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08625)
*Hyeonggeun Han,Sehwan Kim,Hyungjun Joo,Sangwoo Hong,Jungwoo Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出两种通过调整初始噪声来减少文本到图像扩散模型记忆训练数据的方法，这些方法能促进更早逃离记忆吸引盆地，从而在保持图像-文本对齐的同时显著减少记忆现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型经常记忆和复制训练数据，引发隐私和版权担忧。现有方法延迟应用分类器自由引导(CFG)来避免记忆，但这会导致生成的图像与输入提示对齐不佳。需要找到方法让去噪轨迹更早逃离记忆吸引盆地，以便能更早应用CFG。

Method: 1. 发现初始噪声样本在决定逃离时间中起关键作用；2. 提出两种缓解策略：集体或单独调整初始噪声，找到并利用能促进更早盆地逃离的初始样本。

Result: 这些方法显著减少了记忆现象，同时保持了图像-文本对齐质量。

Conclusion: 通过精心选择初始噪声样本，可以有效促进去噪轨迹更早逃离记忆吸引盆地，从而在减少模型记忆训练数据的同时保持良好的生成质量。

Abstract: Despite their impressive generative capabilities, text-to-image diffusion
models often memorize and replicate training data, prompting serious concerns
over privacy and copyright. Recent work has attributed this memorization to an
attraction basin-a region where applying classifier-free guidance (CFG) steers
the denoising trajectory toward memorized outputs-and has proposed deferring
CFG application until the denoising trajectory escapes this basin. However,
such delays often result in non-memorized images that are poorly aligned with
the input prompts, highlighting the need to promote earlier escape so that CFG
can be applied sooner in the denoising process. In this work, we show that the
initial noise sample plays a crucial role in determining when this escape
occurs. We empirically observe that different initial samples lead to varying
escape times. Building on this insight, we propose two mitigation strategies
that adjust the initial noise-either collectively or individually-to find and
utilize initial samples that encourage earlier basin escape. These approaches
significantly reduce memorization while preserving image-text alignment.

### [4] [The Digital Mirror: Gender Bias and Occupational Stereotypes in AI-Generated Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08628)
*Siiri Leppälampi,Sonja M. Hyrynsalmi,Erno Vanhala*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究测试了AI生成图像中的代表性偏见，发现DALL-E 3和Ideogram都强化了传统性别刻板印象，尽管程度不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注AI生成可视化的创建过程和质量，忽视了代表性偏见问题。随着AI图像工具广泛使用，解决有害的性别偏见对于确保媒体和专业环境中的多样化表征至关重要。

Method: 通过生成750多张职业相关的AI图像，使用主题分析方法评估DALL-E 3和Ideogram两个AI图像生成工具的表现，并讨论年龄和情感等话题。

Result: 分析结果显示，两种AI工具都强化了传统性别刻板印象，但程度有所不同。AI可视化工具存在强化狭隘表征的风险。

Conclusion: 研究提出了针对从业者、个人和研究者的建议，以在生成可见性别图像时增加代表性。

Abstract: Generative AI offers vast opportunities for creating visualisations, such as
graphics, videos, and images. However, recent studies around AI-generated
visualisations have primarily focused on the creation process and image
quality, overlooking representational biases. This study addresses this gap by
testing representation biases in AI-generated pictures in an occupational
setting and evaluating how two AI image generator tools, DALL-E 3 and Ideogram,
compare. Additionally, the study discusses topics such as ageing and emotions
in AI-generated images. As AI image tools are becoming more widely used,
addressing and mitigating harmful gender biases becomes essential to ensure
diverse representation in media and professional settings. In this study, over
750 AI-generated images of occupations were prompted. The thematic analysis
results revealed that both DALL-E 3 and Ideogram reinforce traditional gender
stereotypes in AI-generated images, although to varying degrees. These findings
emphasise that AI visualisation tools risk reinforcing narrow representations.
In our discussion section, we propose suggestions for practitioners,
individuals and researchers to increase representation when generating images
with visible genders.

### [5] [Dynamic Mixture-of-Experts for Visual Autoregressive Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08629)
*Jort Vincenti,Metod Jazbec,Guoxuan Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种集成动态专家混合路由器的视觉自回归模型，通过尺度感知阈值减少计算冗余，实现20% FLOPs减少和11%推理加速，同时保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉自回归模型在递增分辨率下重复调用Transformer导致计算冗余，需要更高效的架构。

Method: 在VAR中集成动态MoE路由器，采用尺度感知阈值策略平衡专家选择，无需额外训练。

Result: 减少20% FLOPs，推理速度提升11%，图像质量与密集基线模型相当。

Conclusion: 动态MoE路由器能有效减少VAR模型的计算开销，实现计算效率与图像质量的平衡。

Abstract: Visual Autoregressive Models (VAR) offer efficient and high-quality image
generation but suffer from computational redundancy due to repeated Transformer
calls at increasing resolutions. We introduce a dynamic Mixture-of-Experts
router integrated into VAR. The new architecture allows to trade compute for
quality through scale-aware thresholding. This thresholding strategy balances
expert selection based on token complexity and resolution, without requiring
additional training. As a result, we achieve 20% fewer FLOPs, 11% faster
inference and match the image quality achieved by the dense baseline.

### [6] [Out-of-Distribution Detection in LiDAR Semantic Segmentation Using Epistemic Uncertainty from Hierarchical GMMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08631)
*Hanieh Shojaei Miandashti,Claus Brenner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于层次贝叶斯建模的无监督OOD检测方法，通过分离认知不确定性来改进LiDAR点云中的异常物体检测，无需辅助数据或额外训练阶段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督OOD检测方法通常依赖预测熵，但这种方法混淆了认知不确定性和偶然不确定性，导致将分布内模糊区域误分类为OOD。

Method: 使用层次贝叶斯建模对深度神经网络特征空间中的高斯混合模型参数进行建模，从中提取认知不确定性用于OOD检测。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI数据集上，相比预测熵方法，AUROC提升18%，AUPRC提升22%，FPR95从76%降至40%（降低36%）。

Conclusion: 该方法有效分离了认知不确定性，显著提升了无监督OOD检测性能，无需辅助数据或额外训练。

Abstract: In addition to accurate scene understanding through precise semantic
segmentation of LiDAR point clouds, detecting out-of-distribution (OOD)
objects, instances not encountered during training, is essential to prevent the
incorrect assignment of unknown objects to known classes. While supervised OOD
detection methods depend on auxiliary OOD datasets, unsupervised methods avoid
this requirement but typically rely on predictive entropy, the entropy of the
predictive distribution obtained by averaging over an ensemble or multiple
posterior weight samples. However, these methods often conflate epistemic
(model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainties, misclassifying ambiguous in
distribution regions as OOD. To address this issue, we present an unsupervised
OOD detection approach that employs epistemic uncertainty derived from
hierarchical Bayesian modeling of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) parameters in
the feature space of a deep neural network. Without requiring auxiliary data or
additional training stages, our approach outperforms existing uncertainty-based
methods on the SemanticKITTI dataset, achieving an 18\% improvement in AUROC,
22\% increase in AUPRC, and 36\% reduction in FPR95 (from 76\% to 40\%),
compared to the predictive entropy approach used in prior works.

### [7] [Human-VDM: Learning Single-Image 3D Human Gaussian Splatting from Video Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02851)
*Zhibin Liu,Haoye Dong,Aviral Chharia,Hefeng Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Human-VDM是一种从单张RGB图像生成3D人体的新方法，通过视频扩散模型和Gaussian Splatting技术解决多视角不一致问题，实现高质量3D人体生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用多视角扩散模型进行3D生成，但经常面临视角不一致的问题，这阻碍了高质量3D人体的生成。

Method: Human-VDM包含三个模块：视角一致的人体视频扩散模块、视频增强模块和Gaussian Splatting模块。首先通过视频扩散生成连贯的人体视频，然后进行超分辨率和视频插值增强，最后使用Gaussian Splatting学习逼真的3D人体。

Result: 实验表明Human-VDM能够从单张图像生成高质量的3D人体，在生成质量和数量上都优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: Human-VDM通过视频扩散模型和Gaussian Splatting技术，有效解决了多视角不一致问题，实现了从单张RGB图像生成高质量3D人体的目标。

Abstract: Generating lifelike 3D humans from a single RGB image remains a challenging
task in computer vision, as it requires accurate modeling of geometry,
high-quality texture, and plausible unseen parts. Existing methods typically
use multi-view diffusion models for 3D generation, but they often face
inconsistent view issues, which hinder high-quality 3D human generation. To
address this, we propose Human-VDM, a novel method for generating 3D human from
a single RGB image using Video Diffusion Models. Human-VDM provides temporally
consistent views for 3D human generation using Gaussian Splatting. It consists
of three modules: a view-consistent human video diffusion module, a video
augmentation module, and a Gaussian Splatting module. First, a single image is
fed into a human video diffusion module to generate a coherent human video.
Next, the video augmentation module applies super-resolution and video
interpolation to enhance the textures and geometric smoothness of the generated
video. Finally, the 3D Human Gaussian Splatting module learns lifelike humans
under the guidance of these high-resolution and view-consistent images.
Experiments demonstrate that Human-VDM achieves high-quality 3D human from a
single image, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both generation quality
and quantity. Project page: https://human-vdm.github.io/Human-VDM/

### [8] [Hi-OSCAR: Hierarchical Open-set Classifier for Human Activity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08635)
*Conor McCarthy,Loes Quirijnen,Jan Peter van Zandwijk,Zeno Geradts,Marcel Worring*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Hi-OSCAR：一种层次化开放集活动识别分类器，能够在保持最先进准确率的同时拒绝未知活动，并提供超越二元分类的层次化定位能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人类活动识别中无法处理未见活动的问题，以及活动类别间存在层次结构关系而非完全独立的问题。

Method: 将活动类别组织成结构化层次，开发Hi-OSCAR层次化开放集分类器，同时收集新的NFI_FARED数据集。

Result: 能够以最先进准确率识别已知活动，同时拒绝未知活动，并能将未知类别定位到最近的内部节点。

Conclusion: Hi-OSCAR在开放集活动识别中表现出色，提供了比传统二元分类更丰富的洞察力，新数据集NFI_FARED为未来研究提供了支持。

Abstract: Within Human Activity Recognition (HAR), there is an insurmountable gap
between the range of activities performed in life and those that can be
captured in an annotated sensor dataset used in training. Failure to properly
handle unseen activities seriously undermines any HAR classifier's reliability.
Additionally within HAR, not all classes are equally dissimilar, some
significantly overlap or encompass other sub-activities. Based on these
observations, we arrange activity classes into a structured hierarchy. From
there, we propose Hi-OSCAR: a Hierarchical Open-set Classifier for Activity
Recognition, that can identify known activities at state-of-the-art accuracy
while simultaneously rejecting unknown activities. This not only enables
open-set classification, but also allows for unknown classes to be localized to
the nearest internal node, providing insight beyond a binary "known/unknown"
classification. To facilitate this and future open-set HAR research, we
collected a new dataset: NFI_FARED. NFI_FARED contains data from multiple
subjects performing nineteen activities from a range of contexts, including
daily living, commuting, and rapid movements, which is fully public and
available for download.

### [9] [Detection of high-frequency oscillations using time-frequency analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08637)
*Mostafa Mohammadpour,Mehdi Zekriyapanah Gashti,Yusif S. Gasimov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了一种基于无监督聚类和S变换的高频振荡自动检测方法，在癫痫患者中验证了其作为癫痫灶生物标志物的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高频振荡是识别癫痫灶的新生物标志物，但视觉识别耗时、主观且劳动密集，需要开发自动化检测方法用于临床和研究。

Method: 使用S变换从时频域提取事件，采用无监督聚类技术将高频振荡事件与尖波、背景活动和伪迹区分开。

Result: 在控制数据集上达到97.67%灵敏度、98.57%精确度和97.78% F分数；在癫痫患者中，切除与非切除接触点的高频振荡率比值为0.73，与手术结果相关性更强。

Conclusion: 高频振荡是癫痫患者癫痫发生性的有前景生物标志物，切除高频振荡（特别是快波纹）可达到无癫痫发作，而残留高频振荡则导致癫痫复发。

Abstract: High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) are a new biomarker for identifying the
epileptogenic zone. Mapping HFO-generating regions can improve the precision of
resection sites in patients with refractory epilepsy. However, detecting HFOs
remains challenging, and their clinical features are not yet fully defined.
Visual identification of HFOs is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and
subjective. As a result, developing automated methods to detect HFOs is
critical for research and clinical use. In this study, we developed a novel
method for detecting HFOs in the ripple and fast ripple frequency bands (80-500
Hz). We validated it using both controlled datasets and data from epilepsy
patients. Our method employs an unsupervised clustering technique to categorize
events extracted from the time-frequency domain using the S-transform. The
proposed detector differentiates HFOs events from spikes, background activity,
and artifacts. Compared to existing detectors, our method achieved a
sensitivity of 97.67%, a precision of 98.57%, and an F-score of 97.78% on the
controlled dataset. In epilepsy patients, our results showed a stronger
correlation with surgical outcomes, with a ratio of 0.73 between HFOs rates in
resected versus non-resected contacts. The study confirmed previous findings
that HFOs are promising biomarkers of epileptogenicity in epileptic patients.
Removing HFOs, especially fast ripple, leads to seizure freedom, while
remaining HFOs lead to seizure recurrence.

### [10] [Into the Rabbit Hull: From Task-Relevant Concepts in DINO to Minkowski Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08638)
*Thomas Fel,Binxu Wang,Michael A. Lepori,Matthew Kowal,Andrew Lee,Randall Balestriero,Sonia Joseph,Ekdeep S. Lubana,Talia Konkle,Demba Ba,Martin Wattenberg*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文分析了DINOv2视觉模型的内部表示机制，通过稀疏自编码器构建了32,000个概念字典，揭示了模型在分类、分割和深度估计任务中的功能专业化，并提出了基于凸混合原型的Minkowski表示假说。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管DINOv2被广泛用于物体、场景和动作识别，但其内部感知机制仍不明确。研究旨在理解模型如何表示和处理视觉概念。

Method: 采用线性表示假说，使用稀疏自编码器构建32,000个单元的概念字典，分析不同下游任务如何利用这些概念，并研究表示几何和统计特性。

Result: 发现分类任务利用'Elsewhere'概念实现学习否定；分割依赖边界检测器形成连贯子空间；深度估计使用三种单眼深度线索。表示部分密集而非严格稀疏，具有低维局部连接结构。

Conclusion: 提出Minkowski表示假说：token由凸混合原型组合形成，这种结构基于概念空间理论，为理解视觉变换器表示提供了新视角。

Abstract: DINOv2 is routinely deployed to recognize objects, scenes, and actions; yet
the nature of what it perceives remains unknown. As a working baseline, we
adopt the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH) and operationalize it using
SAEs, producing a 32,000-unit dictionary that serves as the interpretability
backbone of our study, which unfolds in three parts.
  In the first part, we analyze how different downstream tasks recruit concepts
from our learned dictionary, revealing functional specialization:
classification exploits "Elsewhere" concepts that fire everywhere except on
target objects, implementing learned negations; segmentation relies on boundary
detectors forming coherent subspaces; depth estimation draws on three distinct
monocular depth cues matching visual neuroscience principles.
  Following these functional results, we analyze the geometry and statistics of
the concepts learned by the SAE. We found that representations are partly dense
rather than strictly sparse. The dictionary evolves toward greater coherence
and departs from maximally orthogonal ideals (Grassmannian frames). Within an
image, tokens occupy a low dimensional, locally connected set persisting after
removing position. These signs suggest representations are organized beyond
linear sparsity alone.
  Synthesizing these observations, we propose a refined view: tokens are formed
by combining convex mixtures of archetypes (e.g., a rabbit among animals, brown
among colors, fluffy among textures). This structure is grounded in Gardenfors'
conceptual spaces and in the model's mechanism as multi-head attention produces
sums of convex mixtures, defining regions bounded by archetypes. We introduce
the Minkowski Representation Hypothesis (MRH) and examine its empirical
signatures and implications for interpreting vision-transformer
representations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PhyDAE方法，通过两阶段级联架构将退化信息从隐式特征转化为显式决策信号，能够精确识别和处理多种异构退化问题，在保持成像物理一致性的同时显著提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的一体化修复方法过度依赖隐式特征表示，缺乏对退化物理的显式建模，难以有效处理遥感图像中复杂异构的退化问题。

Method: 采用两阶段级联架构，包含残差流形投影器(RMP)和频率感知退化分解器(FADD)进行退化特征分析，引入物理感知专家模块和温度控制稀疏激活策略。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，PhyDAE在四种修复任务中均取得最优性能，同时显著减少参数数量和计算复杂度。

Conclusion: PhyDAE在性能和效率之间实现了最佳平衡，为遥感图像退化修复提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Remote sensing images inevitably suffer from various degradation factors
during acquisition, including atmospheric interference, sensor limitations, and
imaging conditions. These complex and heterogeneous degradations pose severe
challenges to image quality and downstream interpretation tasks. Addressing
limitations of existing all-in-one restoration methods that overly rely on
implicit feature representations and lack explicit modeling of degradation
physics, this paper proposes Physics-Guided Degradation-Adaptive Experts
(PhyDAE). The method employs a two-stage cascaded architecture transforming
degradation information from implicit features into explicit decision signals,
enabling precise identification and differentiated processing of multiple
heterogeneous degradations including haze, noise, blur, and low-light
conditions. The model incorporates progressive degradation mining and
exploitation mechanisms, where the Residual Manifold Projector (RMP) and
Frequency-Aware Degradation Decomposer (FADD) comprehensively analyze
degradation characteristics from manifold geometry and frequency perspectives.
Physics-aware expert modules and temperature-controlled sparse activation
strategies are introduced to enhance computational efficiency while ensuring
imaging physics consistency. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
(MD-RSID, MD-RRSHID, and MDRS-Landsat) demonstrate that PhyDAE achieves
superior performance across all four restoration tasks, comprehensively
outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Notably, PhyDAE substantially improves
restoration quality while achieving significant reductions in parameter count
and computational complexity, resulting in remarkable efficiency gains compared
to mainstream approaches and achieving optimal balance between performance and
efficiency. Code is available at https://github.com/HIT-SIRS/PhyDAE.

Method: 基于统一的基于补丁的视觉编码器和LLM解码器，渐进式训练1670万个样本，从2D扩展到3D和视频理解，采用医学感知的令牌减少技术实现高效训练。

Result: 在30个基准测试中表现出最先进的性能，超越领先的开源模型，在视觉问答、医学报告生成和多语言复杂推理等任务中与专有系统竞争。

Conclusion: 通过开源完整流程，证明高性能医学VLM可以透明实现，为可访问和有影响力的临床AI提供基础工具。

Abstract: Real-world clinical decision-making grapples with integrating information
from diverse data modalities, including medical text, 2D/3D images, and video,
leading to inefficiencies and potential diagnostic oversights. While generalist
vision-language models (VLMs) offer promise, their medical development faces
challenges of opaque pipelines, data scarcity, and architectural inflexibility.
Here we present Hulu-Med, a transparent medical VLM that unifies understanding
across all these modalities. Built upon a unified patch-based vision encoder
and an LLM decoder, Hulu-Med was progressively trained on 16.7 million (M)
samples to scale from 2D to 3D and video comprehension. The medical-aware token
reduction enables efficient training, requiring only 4,000 to 40,000 GPU hours
for 7B to 32B parameter variants. Extensive evaluation across 30 benchmarks
exhibits state-of-the-art performance, surpassing leading open-source models
and competing with proprietary systems in tasks spanning visual
question-answering, medical report generation, and complex reasoning in
multilingual and rare disease scenarios. By open-sourcing our complete
pipeline, we establish that high-performance medical VLM can be achieved
transparently, providing a foundational tool for accessible and impactful
clinical AI. Code is released on

TL;DR: Puffin是一个统一的相机中心多模态模型，通过将相机视为语言来扩展空间感知能力，集成了语言回归和基于扩散的生成，能够从任意视角理解和创建场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相机中心的理解和生成是空间智能的两个基石，但通常被孤立研究。本文旨在开发一个统一的相机中心多模态模型，弥合相机与视觉语言之间的模态差距。

Method: 提出将相机视为语言的新范式，使用Puffin-4M数据集（400万视觉-语言-相机三元组）进行训练，结合全局相机参数和像素级相机映射，实现灵活可靠的空间生成。

Result: 实验表明Puffin在相机中心生成和理解任务上优于专用模型，通过指令调优能够泛化到空间想象、世界探索和摄影指导等多样化跨视角任务。

Conclusion: Puffin通过统一的相机中心方法推进了多模态空间智能研究，将发布代码、模型、数据集管道和基准测试以促进该领域发展。

Abstract: Camera-centric understanding and generation are two cornerstones of spatial
intelligence, yet they are typically studied in isolation. We present Puffin, a
unified camera-centric multimodal model that extends spatial awareness along
the camera dimension. Puffin integrates language regression and diffusion-based
generation to interpret and create scenes from arbitrary viewpoints. To bridge
the modality gap between cameras and vision-language, we introduce a novel
paradigm that treats camera as language, enabling thinking with camera. This
guides the model to align spatially grounded visual cues with photographic
terminology while reasoning across geometric context. Puffin is trained on
Puffin-4M, a large-scale dataset of 4 million vision-language-camera triplets.
We incorporate both global camera parameters and pixel-wise camera maps,
yielding flexible and reliable spatial generation. Experiments demonstrate
Puffin superior performance over specialized models for camera-centric
generation and understanding. With instruction tuning, Puffin generalizes to
diverse cross-view tasks such as spatial imagination, world exploration, and
photography guidance. We will release the code, models, dataset pipeline, and
benchmark to advance multimodal spatial intelligence research.

Method: SOR框架冻结网络内部结构（如卷积滤波器），同时使用组套索和L1惩罚的组合，以最少的额外参数为特定数据定制模型。

Result: 在三个少样本医学图像分类任务上评估SOR，使用DenseNet121和EfficientNetB4基础网络，相比现有基准取得了有竞争力的结果。

Conclusion: SOR是一个简单有效的框架，可广泛应用于各种网络组件，为迁移学习任务提供了广泛适用性。

Abstract: Traditional transfer learning typically reuses large pre-trained networks by
freezing some of their weights and adding task-specific layers. While this
approach is computationally efficient, it limits the model's ability to adapt
to domain-specific features and can still lead to overfitting with very limited
data. To address these limitations, we propose Structured Output Regularization
(SOR), a simple yet effective framework that freezes the internal network
structures (e.g., convolutional filters) while using a combination of group
lasso and $L_1$ penalties. This framework tailors the model to specific data
with minimal additional parameters and is easily applicable to various network
components, such as convolutional filters or various blocks in neural networks
enabling broad applicability for transfer learning tasks. We evaluate SOR on
three few shot medical imaging classification tasks and we achieve competitive
results using DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB4 bases compared to established
benchmarks.

TL;DR: BEAR是一个全面的多模态大语言模型具身能力评估基准，包含4,469个图像-视频-文本条目，涵盖6类14个领域的具身能力。评估发现现有MLLMs在具身能力方面存在持续局限，为此提出了BEAR-Agent代理来增强感知、3D理解和规划能力。

Motivation: 现有基准主要集中在特定领域如规划或空间理解，缺乏对多模态大语言模型具身能力的全面系统评估。

Method: 提出BEAR基准，包含4,469个跨14个领域的图像-视频-文本条目，涵盖从低级指向、轨迹理解到高级规划的6类具身能力。同时提出BEAR-Agent代理，集成预训练视觉模型来增强MLLM的感知、3D理解和规划能力。

Conclusion: BEAR基准填补了MLLM具身能力评估的空白，BEAR-Agent有效提升了MLLMs的具身能力，且这种改进有益于模拟环境中的具身任务。

Abstract: Embodied capabilities refer to a suite of fundamental abilities for an agent
to perceive, comprehend, and interact with the physical world. While multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) show promise as embodied agents, a thorough and
systematic evaluation of their embodied capabilities remains underexplored, as
existing benchmarks primarily focus on specific domains such as planning or
spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we introduce BEAR, a comprehensive
and fine-grained benchmark that evaluates MLLMs on atomic embodied
capabilities. BEAR comprises 4,469 interleaved image-video-text entries across
14 domains in 6 categories, including tasks from low-level pointing, trajectory
understanding, spatial reasoning, to high-level planning. Extensive evaluation
results of 20 representative MLLMs reveal their persistent limitations across
all domains of embodied capabilities. To tackle the shortfall, we propose
BEAR-Agent, a multimodal conversable agent that integrates pretrained vision
models to strengthen MLLM perception, 3D understanding, and planning
capabilities. It substantially enhances MLLM performance across diverse
embodied capabilities on BEAR, yielding a 9.12% absolute gain and a relative
improvement of 17.5% on GPT-5. Furthermore, our experiments indicate that
improving MLLM embodied capabilities can benefit embodied tasks in simulated
environments. Project website: https://bear-official66.github.io/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种受生物视觉机制启发的对抗防御框架，通过强化学习引导的扫视运动选择性采集多个中央-外周视野图像块，重建后进行分类，无需重新训练下游分类器即可提升系统鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统防御方法依赖计算密集型优化，而人类视觉系统通过进化机制天然具备对抗扰动的鲁棒性。假设注意力引导的非均匀稀疏采样和预测编码是这种鲁棒性的关键。

Method: 结合三种生物机制：中央-外周处理、扫视眼动和皮层填充。使用强化学习引导的扫动选择性地捕获多个中央-外周视野图像块，整合成重建图像后进行分类。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上的实验表明，该方法提高了系统对不同分类器和攻击类型的鲁棒性，同时显著减少了训练开销。

Conclusion: 这种受生物启发的预处理方法有效缓解对抗噪声，保持语义完整性，无需重新训练或微调下游分类器，可与现有系统无缝集成。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks significantly challenge the safe deployment of deep
learning models, particularly in real-world applications. Traditional defenses
often rely on computationally intensive optimization (e.g., adversarial
training or data augmentation) to improve robustness, whereas the human visual
system achieves inherent robustness to adversarial perturbations through
evolved biological mechanisms. We hypothesize that attention guided
non-homogeneous sparse sampling and predictive coding plays a key role in this
robustness. To test this hypothesis, we propose a novel defense framework
incorporating three key biological mechanisms: foveal-peripheral processing,
saccadic eye movements, and cortical filling-in. Our approach employs
reinforcement learning-guided saccades to selectively capture multiple
foveal-peripheral glimpses, which are integrated into a reconstructed image
before classification. This biologically inspired preprocessing effectively
mitigates adversarial noise, preserves semantic integrity, and notably requires
no retraining or fine-tuning of downstream classifiers, enabling seamless
integration with existing systems. Experiments on the ImageNet dataset
demonstrate that our method improves system robustness across diverse
classifiers and attack types, while significantly reducing training overhead
compared to both biologically and non-biologically inspired defense techniques.

TL;DR: LinearSR是一个基于线性注意力的图像超分辨率框架，首次系统性地解决了线性注意力在超分辨率中的关键挑战，实现了SOTA感知质量和高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式超分辨率模型依赖自注意力的二次复杂度，存在计算瓶颈。线性注意力提供线性复杂度解决方案，但历史上因训练不稳定等问题未能充分发挥潜力。

Method: 1) 基于"拐点"的早期停止引导微调(ESGF)解决训练不稳定性；2) SNR-based混合专家(MoE)架构缓解感知-失真权衡；3) 基于"精度优先于数量"原则的轻量级TAG引导范式。

Result: LinearSR在单步扩散前向传播中达到SOTA级速度，整体多步推理时间保持高度竞争力，同时提供最先进的感知质量。

Conclusion: 该工作为在真实感超分辨率领域应用线性注意力提供了首个稳健方法，为高效生成式超分辨率建立了基础范式。

Abstract: Generative models for Image Super-Resolution (SR) are increasingly powerful,
yet their reliance on self-attention's quadratic complexity (O(N^2)) creates a
major computational bottleneck. Linear Attention offers an O(N) solution, but
its promise for photorealistic SR has remained largely untapped, historically
hindered by a cascade of interrelated and previously unsolved challenges. This
paper introduces LinearSR, a holistic framework that, for the first time,
systematically overcomes these critical hurdles. Specifically, we resolve a
fundamental, training instability that causes catastrophic model divergence
using our novel "knee point"-based Early-Stopping Guided Fine-tuning (ESGF)
strategy. Furthermore, we mitigate the classic perception-distortion trade-off
with a dedicated SNR-based Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. Finally, we
establish an effective and lightweight guidance paradigm, TAG, derived from our
"precision-over-volume" principle. Our resulting LinearSR model simultaneously
delivers state-of-the-art perceptual quality with exceptional efficiency. Its
core diffusion forward pass (1-NFE) achieves SOTA-level speed, while its
overall multi-step inference time remains highly competitive. This work
provides the first robust methodology for applying Linear Attention in the
photorealistic SR domain, establishing a foundational paradigm for future
research in efficient generative super-resolution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统野生动物监测方法（如鸟类腿环标记）耗时且具有侵入性，需要开发非侵入式的高效自动化识别方案。

Method: 结合YOLO和Grounding DINO进行目标检测、光流模糊检测、DINOv2图像编码和聚类方法，从定制喂食器的视频中提取代表性关键帧。

Result: 所提出的关键帧选择方法在kākā重识别任务中实现了高准确率。

Conclusion: 这种基于AI和计算机视觉的非侵入式方法为野生动物监测提供了有价值的替代方案，有助于生态学和保护生物学的发展。

Abstract: Accurate recognition and re-identification of individual animals is essential
for successful wildlife population monitoring. Traditional methods, such as leg
banding of birds, are time consuming and invasive. Recent progress in
artificial intelligence, particularly computer vision, offers encouraging
solutions for smart conservation and efficient automation. This study presents
a unique pipeline for extracting high-quality key frames from videos of
k\={a}k\={a} (Nestor meridionalis), a threatened forest-dwelling parrot in New
Zealand. Key frame extraction is well-studied in person re-identification,
however, its application to wildlife is limited. Using video recordings at a
custom-built feeder, we extract key frames and evaluate the re-identification
performance of our pipeline. Our unsupervised methodology combines object
detection using YOLO and Grounding DINO, optical flow blur detection, image
encoding with DINOv2, and clustering methods to identify representative key
frames. The results indicate that our proposed key frame selection methods
yield image collections which achieve high accuracy in k\={a}k\={a}
re-identification, providing a foundation for future research using media
collected in more diverse and challenging environments. Through the use of
artificial intelligence and computer vision, our non-invasive and efficient
approach provides a valuable alternative to traditional physical tagging
methods for recognising k\={a}k\={a} individuals and therefore improving the
monitoring of populations. This research contributes to developing fresh
approaches in wildlife monitoring, with applications in ecology and
conservation biology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Q-Router是一个用于通用视频质量评估的智能框架，通过多层级模型路由系统动态选择和集成专家模型，解决了现有VQA模型泛化性差、可解释性有限和可扩展性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA模型存在三个主要问题：跨不同内容和任务的泛化能力差（从用户生成内容到AI生成内容）、可解释性有限、以及对新用例或内容类型缺乏可扩展性。

Method: 提出Q-Router框架，集成多样化专家模型，使用视觉-语言模型作为实时路由器，根据输入视频语义动态推理并集成最合适的专家模型。构建基于计算预算的多层级路由系统，最重层级包含特定的时空伪影定位以实现可解释性。

Result: Q-Router在各种基准测试中达到或超越最先进的VQA模型，显著提高了泛化性和可解释性。在质量问答基准Q-Bench-Video上表现优异，并能有效定位时空伪影。

Conclusion: Q-Router展示了作为下一代VQA系统基础的潜力，能够结合专家模型的互补优势，在异构视频源和任务中实现灵活性和鲁棒性，并有潜力作为视频生成模型后训练阶段的奖励函数。

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) is a fundamental computer vision task that
aims to predict the perceptual quality of a given video in alignment with human
judgments. Existing performant VQA models trained with direct score supervision
suffer from (1) poor generalization across diverse content and tasks, ranging
from user-generated content (UGC), short-form videos, to AI-generated content
(AIGC), (2) limited interpretability, and (3) lack of extensibility to novel
use cases or content types. We propose Q-Router, an agentic framework for
universal VQA with a multi-tier model routing system. Q-Router integrates a
diverse set of expert models and employs vision--language models (VLMs) as
real-time routers that dynamically reason and then ensemble the most
appropriate experts conditioned on the input video semantics. We build a
multi-tiered routing system based on the computing budget, with the heaviest
tier involving a specific spatiotemporal artifacts localization for
interpretability. This agentic design enables Q-Router to combine the
complementary strengths of specialized experts, achieving both flexibility and
robustness in delivering consistent performance across heterogeneous video
sources and tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Router matches or
surpasses state-of-the-art VQA models on a variety of benchmarks, while
substantially improving generalization and interpretability. Moreover, Q-Router
excels on the quality-based question answering benchmark, Q-Bench-Video,
highlighting its promise as a foundation for next-generation VQA systems.
Finally, we show that Q-Router capably localizes spatiotemporal artifacts,
showing potential as a reward function for post-training video generation
models.

Motivation: 现有Med-VQA方法缺乏统一的模态对齐解决方案，硬负样本问题研究不足，且常用知识融合技术可能引入无关信息

Method: 1) 多层次、多模态、多视角、多阶段的统一模态对齐方法；2) 使用软标签的硬负样本挖掘方法；3) 集成答案词汇作为先验知识的门控交叉注意力模块

Result: 在RAD-VQA、SLAKE、PathVQA和VQA-2019等广泛使用的Med-VQA数据集上超越了之前的最先进方法

Conclusion: 该框架通过解决模态对齐、硬负样本和知识融合等关键挑战，显著提升了Med-VQA任务的性能

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) is a challenging task that
requires a deep understanding of both medical images and textual questions.
Although recent works leveraging Medical Vision-Language Pre-training (Med-VLP)
have shown strong performance on the Med-VQA task, there is still no unified
solution for modality alignment, and the issue of hard negatives remains
under-explored. Additionally, commonly used knowledge fusion techniques for
Med-VQA may introduce irrelevant information. In this work, we propose a
framework to address these challenges through three key contributions: (1) a
unified solution for heterogeneous modality alignments across multiple levels,
modalities, views, and stages, leveraging methods like contrastive learning and
optimal transport theory; (2) a hard negative mining method that employs soft
labels for multi-modality alignments and enforces the hard negative pair
discrimination; and (3) a Gated Cross-Attention Module for Med-VQA that
integrates the answer vocabulary as prior knowledge and selects relevant
information from it. Our framework outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on
widely used Med-VQA datasets like RAD-VQA, SLAKE, PathVQA and VQA-2019.

TL;DR: SkipSR是一个加速视频超分辨率的框架，通过识别低分辨率输入中的低细节区域并跳过这些区域的计算，只对需要细化的区域进行超分辨率处理，从而显著减少计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于扩散模型的视频超分辨率方法处理所有像素，计算成本高且速度慢，限制了向更高分辨率和更长视频的扩展。许多视频区域本身细节较少，从细化中获益甚微。

Method: 提出SkipSR框架，直接从低分辨率输入中识别低细节区域，完全跳过这些区域的计算，仅对需要细化的区域进行超分辨率处理。

Result: 在标准超分辨率基准测试中，该方法在720p视频上比现有模型端到端延迟减少高达60%，且没有可感知的质量损失。

Conclusion: SkipSR通过选择性处理视频区域，在保持感知质量的同时显著降低了计算成本，为视频生成和修复提供了高效的超分辨率解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) is a key component in video generation
and video restoration, but is slow and expensive, limiting scalability to
higher resolutions and longer videos. Our key insight is that many regions in
video are inherently low-detail and gain little from refinement, yet current
methods process all pixels uniformly. To take advantage of this, we propose
SkipSR, a simple framework for accelerating video SR by identifying low-detail
regions directly from low-resolution input, then skipping computation on them
entirely, only super-resolving the areas that require refinement. This simple
yet effective strategy preserves perceptual quality in both standard and
one-step diffusion SR models while significantly reducing computation. In
standard SR benchmarks, our method achieves up to 60% faster end-to-end latency
than prior models on 720p videos with no perceptible loss in quality. Video
demos are available at https://rccchoudhury.github.io/skipsr/

Method: 提出D-CoDe框架，包含动态压缩（自适应选择代表性帧和内容感知的空间令牌聚合）和问题分解（将原始查询重构为子问题）两个组件。

Result: 实验表明D-CoDe在各种基准测试中有效提升了视频理解能力，在具有挑战性的长视频基准上表现优异。

Conclusion: D-CoDe展示了处理复杂视频语言任务的潜力，为图像预训练模型向视频领域扩展提供了有效的训练免费适配方案。

Abstract: Video large language models (Vid-LLMs), which excel in diverse video-language
tasks, can be effectively constructed by adapting image-pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs). However, this adaptation remains challenging, as
it requires processing dense and temporally extended visual inputs that exceed
the capacity of image-based models. This paper identifies the perception
bottleneck and token overload as key challenges in extending image-based VLMs
to the video domain. To address these issues, we propose D-CoDe, a
training-free adaptation framework that incorporates dynamic compression and
question decomposition. Specifically, dynamic compression alleviates the
perception bottleneck through adaptive selection of representative frames and
content-aware aggregation of spatial tokens, thereby reducing redundancy while
preserving informative content. In parallel, question decomposition mitigates
token overload by reformulating the original query into sub-questions, guiding
the model to focus on distinct aspects of the video and enabling more
comprehensive understanding. Experiments demonstrate that D-CoDe effectively
improves video understanding across various benchmarks. Furthermore, strong
performance on the challenging long-video benchmark highlights the potential of
D-CoDe in handling complex video-language tasks. Code is available at

Conclusion: FOLK方法通过知识蒸馏有效解决了开放词汇3D实例分割中的噪声和效率问题

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation seeks to segment and classify
instances beyond the annotated label space. Existing methods typically map 3D
instances to 2D RGB-D images, and then employ vision-language models (VLMs) for
classification. However, such a mapping strategy usually introduces noise from
2D occlusions and incurs substantial computational and memory costs during
inference, slowing down the inference speed. To address the above problems, we
propose a Fast Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation method via Label-guided
Knowledge distillation (FOLK). Our core idea is to design a teacher model that
extracts high-quality instance embeddings and distills its open-vocabulary
knowledge into a 3D student model. In this way, during inference, the distilled
3D model can directly classify instances from the 3D point cloud, avoiding
noise caused by occlusions and significantly accelerating the inference
process. Specifically, we first design a teacher model to generate a 2D CLIP
embedding for each 3D instance, incorporating both visibility and viewpoint
diversity, which serves as the learning target for distillation. We then
develop a 3D student model that directly produces a 3D embedding for each 3D
instance. During training, we propose a label-guided distillation algorithm to
distill open-vocabulary knowledge from label-consistent 2D embeddings into the
student model. FOLK conducted experiments on the ScanNet200 and Replica
datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNet200 dataset with
an AP50 score of 35.7, while running approximately 6.0x to 152.2x faster than
previous methods. All codes will be released after the paper is accepted.

Motivation: 蔓越莓种植中的变化监测通常需要人工完成，耗时且效率低。深度学习虽有望解决此问题，但存在高维特征难以解释和需要大量标注数据的挑战。

Method: 使用自监督方法微调视觉变换器(ViTs)，通过双重预训练任务(时间回归和类别预测)学习时间序列的潜在空间表示，生成可解释的2D时间轨迹。

Conclusion: 该自监督方法为作物生长监测提供了一种通用解决方案，可应用于其他作物和农业应用场景，避免了繁琐的图像标注需求。

Abstract: Change monitoring is an essential task for cranberry farming as it provides
both breeders and growers with the ability to analyze growth, predict yield,
and make treatment decisions. However, this task is often done manually,
requiring significant time on the part of a cranberry grower or breeder. Deep
learning based change monitoring holds promise, despite the caveat of
hard-to-interpret high dimensional features and hand-annotations for
fine-tuning. To address this gap, we introduce a method for modeling crop
growth based on fine-tuning vision transformers (ViTs) using a self-supervised
approach that avoids tedious image annotations. We use a two-fold pretext task
(time regression and class prediction) to learn a latent space for the
time-lapse evolution of plant and fruit appearance. The resulting 2D temporal
tracks provide an interpretable time-series model of crop growth that can be
used to: 1) predict growth over time and 2) distinguish temporal differences of
cranberry varieties. We also provide a novel time-lapse dataset of cranberry
fruit featuring eight distinct varieties, observed 52 times over the growing
season (span of around four months), annotated with information about fungicide
application, yield, and rot. Our approach is general and can be applied to
other crops and applications (code and dataset can be found at https://github.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHyCLIP提出了一种在双曲空间乘积上使用ℓ₁-乘积度量的方法，同时捕捉概念族内的层次结构和跨概念族的组合关系，在多个任务上优于现有单空间方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型难以同时表达概念族内的层次结构（如狗⊆哺乳动物⊆动物）和跨概念族的组合关系（如"汽车里的狗"⊆狗、汽车），双曲空间虽能有效捕捉层次结构，但处理组合关系的能力不明确。

Method: PHyCLIP在双曲因子的笛卡尔积上使用ℓ₁-乘积度量，概念族内层次结构在单个双曲因子中形成，跨概念族组合通过ℓ₁-乘积度量捕捉，类似于布尔代数。

Result: 在零样本分类、检索、层次分类和组合理解任务上的实验表明，PHyCLIP优于现有单空间方法，并在嵌入空间中提供更可解释的结构。

Conclusion: PHyCLIP通过双曲空间乘积和ℓ₁-乘积度量的设计，成功解决了同时表达层次结构和组合关系的挑战，为多模态表示学习提供了更强大的框架。

Abstract: Vision-language models have achieved remarkable success in multi-modal
representation learning from large-scale pairs of visual scenes and linguistic
descriptions. However, they still struggle to simultaneously express two
distinct types of semantic structures: the hierarchy within a concept family
(e.g., dog $\preceq$ mammal $\preceq$ animal) and the compositionality across
different concept families (e.g., "a dog in a car" $\preceq$ dog, car). Recent
works have addressed this challenge by employing hyperbolic space, which
efficiently captures tree-like hierarchy, yet its suitability for representing
compositionality remains unclear. To resolve this dilemma, we propose PHyCLIP,
which employs an $\ell_1$-Product metric on a Cartesian product of Hyperbolic
factors. With our design, intra-family hierarchies emerge within individual
hyperbolic factors, and cross-family composition is captured by the
$\ell_1$-product metric, analogous to a Boolean algebra. Experiments on
zero-shot classification, retrieval, hierarchical classification, and
compositional understanding tasks demonstrate that PHyCLIP outperforms existing
single-space approaches and offers more interpretable structures in the
embedding space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对抗攻击方法在分割模型间的迁移性较差，主要由于分割模型复杂的上下文依赖性和代理模型与目标模型之间的特征分布差距。

Method: 将输入样本划分为多个局部区域，重新映射语义信息生成增强样本，用这些增强样本替代原始样本进行扰动优化，仅保留局部语义信息而非全局语义信息。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC和Cityscapes两个基准数据集、四种不同分割模型和三种骨干网络上的实验表明，SegTrans显著提高了对抗迁移成功率，平均提升8.55%，计算效率提升超过100%。

Conclusion: SegTrans在无需引入额外计算开销的情况下，显著提高了对抗样本在不同分割模型间的可迁移性，优于现有最先进方法。

Abstract: Segmentation models exhibit significant vulnerability to adversarial examples
in white-box settings, but existing adversarial attack methods often show poor
transferability across different segmentation models. While some researchers
have explored transfer-based adversarial attack (i.e., transfer attack) methods
for segmentation models, the complex contextual dependencies within these
models and the feature distribution gaps between surrogate and target models
result in unsatisfactory transfer success rates. To address these issues, we
propose SegTrans, a novel transfer attack framework that divides the input
sample into multiple local regions and remaps their semantic information to
generate diverse enhanced samples. These enhanced samples replace the original
ones for perturbation optimization, thereby improving the transferability of
adversarial examples across different segmentation models. Unlike existing
methods, SegTrans only retains local semantic information from the original
input, rather than using global semantic information to optimize perturbations.
Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, PASCAL VOC and Cityscapes,
four different segmentation models, and three backbone networks show that
SegTrans significantly improves adversarial transfer success rates without
introducing additional computational overhead. Compared to the current
state-of-the-art methods, SegTrans achieves an average increase of 8.55% in
transfer attack success rate and improves computational efficiency by more than
100%.

*Han Hu,Zhuoran Zheng,Chen Lyu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ASVP方法，通过奇异值分解对图像恢复模型的内部特征图进行扰动，有效防御知识蒸馏攻击，保护模型知识产权。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识蒸馏攻击严重威胁深度学习模型的知识产权，现有防御方法在图像分类中有效，但难以扩展到图像恢复任务，因为图像恢复是生成任务，需要保持空间一致性和细节完整性。

Method: ASVP方法在运行时对教师模型的内部特征图进行奇异值分解，放大前k个奇异值以注入结构化高频扰动，破坏蒸馏所需的对齐关系。

Result: 在超分辨率、低光增强、水下增强、去雾和去雨五个图像恢复任务中，ASVP将学生模型的PSNR降低达4dB，SSIM降低60-75%，对教师模型性能影响可忽略。

Conclusion: ASVP为保护开源图像恢复模型免受未经授权的知识蒸馏提供了实用解决方案，相比现有方法提供更强且更一致的防御效果。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) attacks pose a significant threat to deep model
intellectual property by enabling adversaries to train student networks using a
teacher model's outputs. While recent defenses in image classification have
successfully disrupted KD by perturbing output probabilities, extending these
methods to image restoration is difficult. Unlike classification, restoration
is a generative task with continuous, high-dimensional outputs that depend on
spatial coherence and fine details. Minor perturbations are often insufficient,
as students can still learn the underlying mapping.To address this, we propose
Adaptive Singular Value Perturbation (ASVP), a runtime defense tailored for
image restoration models. ASVP operates on internal feature maps of the teacher
using singular value decomposition (SVD). It amplifies the topk singular values
to inject structured, high-frequency perturbations, disrupting the alignment
needed for distillation. This hinders student learning while preserving the
teacher's output quality.We evaluate ASVP across five image restoration tasks:
super-resolution, low-light enhancement, underwater enhancement, dehazing, and
deraining. Experiments show ASVP reduces student PSNR by up to 4 dB and SSIM by
60-75%, with negligible impact on the teacher's performance. Compared to prior
methods, ASVP offers a stronger and more consistent defense.Our approach
provides a practical solution to protect open-source restoration models from
unauthorized knowledge distillation.

TL;DR: 提出了Ro-Bench基准测试，用于评估多模态大语言模型在面对操纵视频内容时的鲁棒性，发现现有模型在反事实视频上性能显著下降，并通过反事实数据微调提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视频理解任务中表现出色，但其在面对被操纵视频内容时的鲁棒性尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 创建Ro-Bench基准测试，包含通过编辑风格、物体、背景及其组合生成的高质量、多样化且时间相关的反事实视频数据，评估了8个最新视频MLLM模型。

Result: 当前模型在反事实视频内容上表现出显著的性能下降，而使用反事实数据微调MLLM可将Ro-Bench性能提升21.73%，在MVBench数据集的20个任务上提升12.78%。

Conclusion: 反事实数据能有效增强MLLM的视频理解能力，强调了评估和改进模型鲁棒性的重要性。

Abstract: Recently, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
significant performance across various video understanding tasks. However,
their robustness, particularly when faced with manipulated video content,
remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Ro-Bench, the first
benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on dynamic out-of-distribution (OOD)
counterfactual video test sets. Ro-Bench incorporates high-quality, diverse and
temporally relevant video data, by editing Style, Object, Background and their
compositions. We evaluated eight recent video MLLMs and found that current
models exhibit substantial performance degradation on Ro-Bench when exposed to
counterfactual video content. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning
MLLMs with counterfactual data enhances robustness, achieving a 21.73%
performance increase on Ro-Bench and a 12.78% improvement across 20 tasks in
the MVBench dataset. These findings underscore the effectiveness of
counterfactual data in enhancing the video understanding ability of MLLMs. The
code and data will be released shortly.

Motivation: 解决农业无人机监测中因数据稀缺、动物遮挡、品种环境差异等导致的动物健康监测困难，传统迁移学习方法因缺乏特定农场条件的大数据集而效果有限

Method: 开发对象聚焦数据增强框架，分割动物与背景，通过变换和基于扩散的合成技术创建真实多样的场景，提升动物检测和监测能力

Result: 初步实验表明，增强后的数据集在动物检测任务上比基线模型表现更优

Conclusion: 该方法通过生成领域特定数据，即使在数据稀缺情况下也能实现实时动物健康监测，弥合了有限数据与实际应用之间的差距

Abstract: Modern agricultural operations increasingly rely on integrated monitoring
systems that combine multiple data sources for farm optimization. Aerial
drone-based animal health monitoring serves as a key component but faces
limited data availability, compounded by scene-specific issues such as small,
occluded, or partially visible animals. Transfer learning approaches often fail
to address this limitation due to the unavailability of large datasets that
reflect specific farm conditions, including variations in animal breeds,
environments, and behaviors. Therefore, there is a need for developing a
problem-specific, animal-focused data augmentation strategy tailored to these
unique challenges. To address this gap, we propose an object-focused data
augmentation framework designed explicitly for animal health monitoring in
constrained data settings. Our approach segments animals from backgrounds and
augments them through transformations and diffusion-based synthesis to create
realistic, diverse scenes that enhance animal detection and monitoring
performance. Our initial experiments demonstrate that our augmented dataset
yields superior performance compared to our baseline models on the animal
detection task. By generating domain-specific data, our method empowers
real-time animal health monitoring solutions even in data-scarce scenarios,
bridging the gap between limited data and practical applicability.

TL;DR: 提出了Perception-Time Scaling (PTS)范式，通过将复杂感知问题分解为中间可处理的子问题，显著提升了大型视觉语言模型在视觉感知任务中的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于强化学习的推理时间缩放方法在提升LVLMs推理能力方面取得了成功，但这些方法对视觉感知的影响尚不明确。当前LVLMs采用快速感知范式，将视觉理解视为一次性输出，没有建模底层的感知过程。

Method: 提出Perception-Time Scaling (PTS)范式，鼓励丰富的token感知，将复杂感知问题分解为中间可处理的子问题，使感知能够与推理时间缩放对齐并从中受益。结合强化学习技术实现。

Result: PTS显著提升了感知精度，在DisTANCE基准上的高精度性能从8.0%提升到64.7%，在领域外任务上泛化良好。即使PTS数据是纯合成的，与数学推理数据结合也能在推理和真实世界感知基准上获得一致提升。

Conclusion: PTS通过引入更多感知相关token并增加模型对图像token的关注，有效解决了当前LVLMs在视觉感知任务中的精度限制问题，为视觉感知与推理时间缩放的结合提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in inference-time scaling, particularly those leveraging
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards, have substantially enhanced the
reasoning capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Inspired by
this success, similar strategies have been applied to multimodal reasoning, yet
their impact on visual perception remains unclear. To investigate this gap, we
introduce DisTANCE, a perception-centric benchmark for visual estimation tasks.
Evaluation results show that LVLMs exhibit limited estimation precision, and
inference-time scaling offers only marginal gains. We attribute this to the
fast perception paradigm of current LVLMs, where visual understanding is
treated as a one-shot output without modeling the underlying perceptual
process. To address this, we propose Perception-Time Scaling (PTS), a novel
paradigm that encourages token-rich perception and decomposes complex
perception problems into intermediate tractable sub-problems, thereby enabling
perception to align with and benefit from inference-time scaling. Combined with
reinforcement learning techniques, PTS significantly improves perception
accuracy, raising high-precision performance on DisTANCE from 8.0% to 64.7%,
and generalizes well to out-of-domain tasks. Surprisingly, even though PTS data
are purely synthetic, combining them with math reasoning data yields consistent
gains in both reasoning and real-world perception benchmarks. Further analysis
reveals that PTS introduces more perception-related tokens and increases the
model's attention to image tokens. Our code and data will be publicly released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: mmJoints框架通过为预训练的毫米波3D姿态估计器输出添加关节描述符，显式估计关节被感知的可能性和位置预测的可靠性，从而提高可解释性和下游任务准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在毫米波姿态估计中，稀疏信号和弱反射导致模型从统计先验而非传感器数据推断身体关节，这种对先验知识的过度依赖会降低下游任务性能。

Method: 引入mmJoints框架，为预训练的黑盒毫米波3D姿态估计器输出添加额外的关节描述符，显式估计关节被感知的可能性和位置预测的可靠性。

Result: 在13种姿态估计设置下使用超过115,000个信号帧进行评估，mmJoints估计描述符的错误率低于4.2%，关节位置精度提高达12.5%，活动识别性能提升达16%。

Conclusion: mmJoints通过显式建模先验偏差，有效提高了毫米波姿态估计的可解释性和下游任务性能。

Abstract: In mmWave-based pose estimation, sparse signals and weak reflections often
cause models to infer body joints from statistical priors rather than sensor
data. While prior knowledge helps in learning meaningful representations,
over-reliance on it degrades performance in downstream tasks like gesture and
activity recognition. In this paper, we introduce mmJoints, a framework that
augments a pre-trained, black-box mmWave-based 3D pose estimator's output with
additional joint descriptors. Rather than mitigating bias, mmJoints makes it
explicit by estimating the likelihood of a joint being sensed and the
reliability of its predicted location. These descriptors enhance
interpretability and improve downstream task accuracy. Through extensive
evaluations using over 115,000 signal frames across 13 pose estimation
settings, we show that mmJoints estimates descriptors with an error rate below
4.2%. mmJoints also improves joint position accuracy by up to 12.5% and boosts
activity recognition by up to 16% over state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于注意力机制的transformer方法在3D手部重建中未能充分建模关节间的空间关系，导致性能不够鲁棒和准确。

Method: 设计图引导状态空间(GSS)块，将Mamba的扫描机制重新表述为图引导的双向扫描，使用比注意力方法少88.5%的token学习关节的空间关系和序列。

Result: 在FreiHAND数据集上达到PA-MPVPE 5.3mm和F@15mm 0.992的SOTA性能，在两个3D手部重建竞赛排行榜中排名第一。

Conclusion: Hamba通过有效结合图引导的状态空间特征和全局-局部特征，显著提升了3D手部重建的性能和效率。

Abstract: 3D Hand reconstruction from a single RGB image is challenging due to the
articulated motion, self-occlusion, and interaction with objects. Existing SOTA
methods employ attention-based transformers to learn the 3D hand pose and
shape, yet they do not fully achieve robust and accurate performance, primarily
due to inefficiently modeling spatial relations between joints. To address this
problem, we propose a novel graph-guided Mamba framework, named Hamba, which
bridges graph learning and state space modeling. Our core idea is to
reformulate Mamba's scanning into graph-guided bidirectional scanning for 3D
reconstruction using a few effective tokens. This enables us to efficiently
learn the spatial relationships between joints for improving reconstruction
performance. Specifically, we design a Graph-guided State Space (GSS) block
that learns the graph-structured relations and spatial sequences of joints and
uses 88.5% fewer tokens than attention-based methods. Additionally, we
integrate the state space features and the global features using a fusion
module. By utilizing the GSS block and the fusion module, Hamba effectively
leverages the graph-guided state space features and jointly considers global
and local features to improve performance. Experiments on several benchmarks
and in-the-wild tests demonstrate that Hamba significantly outperforms existing
SOTAs, achieving the PA-MPVPE of 5.3mm and F@15mm of 0.992 on FreiHAND. At the
time of this paper's acceptance, Hamba holds the top position, Rank 1 in two
Competition Leaderboards on 3D hand reconstruction. Project Website:

Motivation: 传统检索方法精度有限，现有多向量检索方法在图像对象对齐和细粒度图像片段冗余方面存在不足

Method: 采用分层范式使用多个中间粒度处理不同图像对象，利用跨层次相似性一致性和层次稀疏性减少冗余匹配计算

Result: 在精度上取得显著提升，同时计算量比现有MVR系统减少最多3.5倍

Conclusion: HiMIR框架在提高图像检索精度的同时大幅提升了效率，并支持跨场景自动参数配置

Abstract: To effectively leverage user-specific data, retrieval augmented generation
(RAG) is employed in multimodal large language model (MLLM) applications.
However, conventional retrieval approaches often suffer from limited retrieval
accuracy. Recent advances in multi-vector retrieval (MVR) improve accuracy by
decomposing queries and matching against segmented images. They still suffer
from sub-optimal accuracy and efficiency, overlooking alignment between the
query and varying image objects and redundant fine-grained image segments. In
this work, we present an efficient scheduling framework for image retrieval -
HiMIR. First, we introduce a novel hierarchical paradigm, employing multiple
intermediate granularities for varying image objects to enhance alignment.
Second, we minimize redundancy in retrieval by leveraging cross-hierarchy
similarity consistency and hierarchy sparsity to minimize unnecessary matching
computation. Furthermore, we configure parameters for each dataset
automatically for practicality across diverse scenarios. Our empirical study
shows that, HiMIR not only achieves substantial accuracy improvements but also
reduces computation by up to 3.5 times over the existing MVR system.

TL;DR: 提出了首个针对生成手部区域的质量评估任务，开发了HandEval模型，在提升生成手部真实性和AIGC检测准确性方面表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像模型在生成复杂局部区域（特别是人手）时存在结构扭曲和不真实纹理的问题，但手部区域质量评估被忽视，限制了人类中心生成质量优化和AIGC检测等下游任务的性能。

Method: 引入HandPair数据集（包含48k高质量和低质量手部图像对），开发HandEval模型，利用多模态大语言模型的视觉理解能力并结合手部关键点先验知识。

Result: HandEval在人类标注测试集上比现有SOTA方法更好地与人类判断对齐，集成到图像生成和AIGC检测流程中显著提升了生成手部真实性和检测准确性。

Conclusion: HandEval在评估生成手部质量方面表现出色，并在下游应用中展现出通用有效性，为提升文本到图像模型的手部生成质量提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Although recent text-to-image (T2I) models have significantly improved the
overall visual quality of generated images, they still struggle in the
generation of accurate details in complex local regions, especially human
hands. Generated hands often exhibit structural distortions and unrealistic
textures, which can be very noticeable even when the rest of the body is
well-generated. However, the quality assessment of hand regions remains largely
neglected, limiting downstream task performance like human-centric generation
quality optimization and AIGC detection. To address this, we propose the first
quality assessment task targeting generated hand regions and showcase its
abundant downstream applications. We first introduce the HandPair dataset for
training hand quality assessment models. It consists of 48k images formed by
high- and low-quality hand pairs, enabling low-cost, efficient supervision
without manual annotation. Based on it, we develop HandEval, a carefully
designed hand-specific quality assessment model. It leverages the powerful
visual understanding capability of Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) and
incorporates prior knowledge of hand keypoints, gaining strong perception of
hand quality. We further construct a human-annotated test set with hand images
from various state-of-the-art (SOTA) T2I models to validate its quality
evaluation capability. Results show that HandEval aligns better with human
judgments than existing SOTA methods. Furthermore, we integrate HandEval into
image generation and AIGC detection pipelines, prominently enhancing generated
hand realism and detection accuracy, respectively, confirming its universal
effectiveness in downstream applications. Code and dataset will be available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI着色技术虽然强大，但存在版权侵权风险，如未经授权对黑白漫画和电影进行着色并转售。目前缺乏有效的防御方法。

Method: 提出Perception-Aware Chroma-Restrictive Perturbation (PAChroma)方法，使用拉普拉斯滤波器优化不可察觉的扰动以保持感知质量，并在优化过程中应用多样化的输入变换来增强跨模型的可迁移性和对常见后处理的鲁棒性。

Result: 在ImageNet和Danbooru数据集上的实验表明，PAChroma能有效降低着色质量，同时保持视觉外观不变。

Conclusion: 这是保护视觉内容免受非法AI着色的首个防御范例，为生成媒体中的版权保护防御开辟了新途径。

Abstract: AI-based colorization has shown remarkable capability in generating realistic
color images from grayscale inputs. However, it poses risks of copyright
infringement -- for example, the unauthorized colorization and resale of
monochrome manga and films. Despite these concerns, no effective method
currently exists to prevent such misuse. To address this, we introduce the
first defensive paradigm, Uncolorable Examples, which embed imperceptible
perturbations into grayscale images to invalidate unauthorized colorization. To
ensure real-world applicability, we establish four criteria: effectiveness,
imperceptibility, transferability, and robustness. Our method, Perception-Aware
Chroma-Restrictive Perturbation (PAChroma), generates Uncolorable Examples that
meet these four criteria by optimizing imperceptible perturbations with a
Laplacian filter to preserve perceptual quality, and applying diverse input
transformations during optimization to enhance transferability across models
and robustness against common post-processing (e.g., compression). Experiments
on ImageNet and Danbooru datasets demonstrate that PAChroma effectively
degrades colorization quality while maintaining the visual appearance. This
work marks the first step toward protecting visual content from illegitimate AI
colorization, paving the way for copyright-aware defenses in generative media.

Motivation: 自回归文本到图像模型由于顺序token解码过程导致推理速度缓慢，需要数千次模型前向传递来生成单张图像，存在效率问题。

Method: 引入next-clean-token预测范式，通过低成本微调使预训练自回归模型能够接受噪声扰动token嵌入并预测下一个干净token，在推理时使用高斯噪声初始化token序列并进行迭代预测。

Result: 实验表明该方法能够通过减少模型前向传递次数来加速生成，同时保持生成图像的视觉质量。

Conclusion: SJD2框架成功解决了自回归模型推理效率低下的问题，实现了并行token生成，为视觉内容生成提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: As a new paradigm of visual content generation, autoregressive text-to-image
models suffer from slow inference due to their sequential token-by-token
decoding process, often requiring thousands of model forward passes to generate
a single image. To address this inefficiency, we propose Speculative
Jacobi-Denoising Decoding (SJD2), a framework that incorporates the denoising
process into Jacobi iterations to enable parallel token generation in
autoregressive models. Our method introduces a next-clean-token prediction
paradigm that enables the pre-trained autoregressive models to accept
noise-perturbed token embeddings and predict the next clean tokens through
low-cost fine-tuning. This denoising paradigm guides the model towards more
stable Jacobi trajectories. During inference, our method initializes token
sequences with Gaussian noise and performs iterative
next-clean-token-prediction in the embedding space. We employ a probabilistic
criterion to verify and accept multiple tokens in parallel, and refine the
unaccepted tokens for the next iteration with the denoising trajectory.
Experiments show that our method can accelerate generation by reducing model
forward passes while maintaining the visual quality of generated images.

Motivation: 传统方法通常显式组合多模态信息，本文旨在将多模态知识嵌入到单个网络中，使每个单模态网络都能获得性能提升。

Method: 为每个模态分配独立网络，通过时空语义对齐损失(SSA)对齐不同网络的特征内容，并使用焦点正则化参数避免负知识迁移。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效提升了单模态网络的性能，无需多模态融合即可实现先进的动态手势识别效果。

Abstract: We present an efficient approach for leveraging the knowledge from multiple
modalities in training unimodal 3D convolutional neural networks (3D-CNNs) for
the task of dynamic hand gesture recognition. Instead of explicitly combining
multimodal information, which is commonplace in many state-of-the-art methods,
we propose a different framework in which we embed the knowledge of multiple
modalities in individual networks so that each unimodal network can achieve an
improved performance. In particular, we dedicate separate networks per
available modality and enforce them to collaborate and learn to develop
networks with common semantics and better representations. We introduce a
"spatiotemporal semantic alignment" loss (SSA) to align the content of the
features from different networks. In addition, we regularize this loss with our
proposed "focal regularization parameter" to avoid negative knowledge transfer.
Experimental results show that our framework improves the test time recognition
accuracy of unimodal networks, and provides the state-of-the-art performance on
various dynamic hand gesture recognition datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR感知对自动驾驶安全至关重要，但LiDAR标注常因传感器缺陷、遮挡和人为错误而存在噪声。这种噪声会降低分割精度，在域偏移下进一步恶化，威胁系统可靠性。虽然图像中的噪声标签学习已有研究，但在3D LiDAR分割的域泛化中仍未被探索。

Method: 提出DuNe双视图框架，包含强分支和弱分支，通过特征级一致性约束和基于置信度过滤的交叉熵损失来处理噪声标签。将三种代表性的图像噪声标签学习策略适配到3D分割作为基准。

Result: 在10%对称标签噪声下，在SemanticKITTI上达到56.86% mIoU，nuScenes上42.28%，SemanticPOSS上52.58%，算术平均49.57%，调和平均48.50%，在DGLSS-NL任务中展现出鲁棒的域泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该工作填补了3D LiDAR分割在噪声标签下域泛化研究的空白，提出的DuNe框架有效解决了现有噪声标签学习方法在LiDAR数据上适配不佳的问题，为自动驾驶感知系统的可靠性提供了重要保障。

Abstract: Accurate perception is critical for vehicle safety, with LiDAR as a key
enabler in autonomous driving. To ensure robust performance across
environments, sensor types, and weather conditions without costly
re-annotation, domain generalization in LiDAR-based 3D semantic segmentation is
essential. However, LiDAR annotations are often noisy due to sensor
imperfections, occlusions, and human errors. Such noise degrades segmentation
accuracy and is further amplified under domain shifts, threatening system
reliability. While noisy-label learning is well-studied in images, its
extension to 3D LiDAR segmentation under domain generalization remains largely
unexplored, as the sparse and irregular structure of point clouds limits direct
use of 2D methods. To address this gap, we introduce the novel task Domain
Generalization for LiDAR Semantic Segmentation under Noisy Labels (DGLSS-NL)
and establish the first benchmark by adapting three representative noisy-label
learning strategies from image classification to 3D segmentation. However, we
find that existing noisy-label learning approaches adapt poorly to LiDAR data.
We therefore propose DuNe, a dual-view framework with strong and weak branches
that enforce feature-level consistency and apply cross-entropy loss based on
confidence-aware filtering of predictions. Our approach shows state-of-the-art
performance by achieving 56.86% mIoU on SemanticKITTI, 42.28% on nuScenes, and
52.58% on SemanticPOSS under 10% symmetric label noise, with an overall
Arithmetic Mean (AM) of 49.57% and Harmonic Mean (HM) of 48.50%, thereby
demonstrating robust domain generalization in DGLSS-NL tasks. The code is

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs), which integrate a vision encoder (VE)
with a large language model, have achieved remarkable success across various
tasks. However, there are still crucial challenges in LVLMs such as object
hallucination, generating descriptions of objects that are not in the input
image. Here, we argue that uncertain visual tokens within the VE is a key
factor that contributes to object hallucination. Our statistical analysis found
that there are positive correlations between visual tokens with high epistemic
uncertainty and the occurrence of hallucinations. Furthermore, we show
theoretically and empirically that visual tokens in early VE layers that
exhibit large representation deviations under small adversarial perturbations
indicate high epistemic uncertainty. Based on these findings, we propose a
simple yet effective strategy to mitigate object hallucination by modifying the
VE only. Our method comprises a proxy method with adversarial perturbations for
identifying uncertain visual tokens efficiently and a method to mask these
uncertain visual tokens during the self-attention process in the middle layers
of the VE, suppressing their influence on visual encoding and thus alleviating
hallucinations. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly
reduces object hallucinations in LVLMs and can synergistically work with other
prior arts.

Abstract: We present a transductive deep learning-based formulation for the sparse
representation-based classification (SRC) method. The proposed network consists
of a convolutional autoencoder along with a fully-connected layer. The role of
the autoencoder network is to learn robust deep features for classification. On
the other hand, the fully-connected layer, which is placed in between the
encoder and the decoder networks, is responsible for finding the sparse
representation. The estimated sparse codes are then used for classification.
Various experiments on three different datasets show that the proposed network
leads to sparse representations that give better classification results than
state-of-the-art SRC methods. The source code is available at:

Result: 在植入系统收集的图像数据集上验证了所提方法的有效性

Conclusion: 提出的异常检测框架能够可靠监控柔性微电极植入过程

Abstract: Flexible microelectrode (FME) implantation into brain cortex is challenging
due to the deformable fiber-like structure of FME probe and the interaction
with critical bio-tissue. To ensure reliability and safety, the implantation
process should be monitored carefully. This paper develops an image-based
anomaly detection framework based on the microscopic cameras of the robotic FME
implantation system. The unified framework is utilized at four checkpoints to
check the micro-needle, FME probe, hooking result, and implantation point,
respectively. Exploiting the existing object localization results, the aligned
regions of interest (ROIs) are extracted from raw image and input to a
pretrained vision transformer (ViT). Considering the task specifications, we
propose a progressive granularity patch feature sampling method to address the
sensitivity-tolerance trade-off issue at different locations. Moreover, we
select a part of feature channels with higher signal-to-noise ratios from the
raw general ViT features, to provide better descriptors for each specific
scene. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated with the image
datasets collected from our implantation system.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于熵信息的解码策略，通过动态温度控制和熵感知接受规则，在提高自回归图像生成质量的同时加速合成速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现当前自回归图像生成模型中的采样问题，图像token相比文本token具有更低的信息密度和非均匀空间分布特征。

Method: 1) 基于token分布空间熵的动态温度控制；2) 推测解码中的熵感知接受规则，实现接近无损的生成。

Conclusion: 该熵信息解码策略能够有效提升自回归图像生成的性能，具有良好的通用性和实用性。

Abstract: In this work, we first revisit the sampling issues in current autoregressive
(AR) image generation models and identify that image tokens, unlike text
tokens, exhibit lower information density and non-uniform spatial distribution.
Accordingly, we present an entropy-informed decoding strategy that facilitates
higher autoregressive generation quality with faster synthesis speed.
Specifically, the proposed method introduces two main innovations: 1) dynamic
temperature control guided by spatial entropy of token distributions, enhancing
the balance between content diversity, alignment accuracy, and structural
coherence in both mask-based and scale-wise models, without extra computational
overhead, and 2) entropy-aware acceptance rules in speculative decoding,
achieving near-lossless generation at about 85\% of the inference cost of
conventional acceleration methods. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks using diverse AR image generation models demonstrate the
effectiveness and generalizability of our approach in enhancing both generation
quality and sampling speed.

Motivation: 森林管理机器人面临复杂自然环境感知挑战，现有数据集集中在城市环境或有限树种，无法满足精准林业、生物多样性监测和林业设备自动化的需求。

Method: 在加拿大魁北克五个生物气候区域收集林下图像，由林业专家标注1476棵树24个树种的实例分割数据，并基准测试现代深度学习实例分割方法。

Result: 树分割相对容易，最高mAP达67.65%，但树种分类极具挑战性，mAP仅为35.69%。

Abstract: Interest in robotics for forest management is growing, but perception in
complex, natural environments remains a significant hurdle. Conditions such as
heavy occlusion, variable lighting, and dense vegetation pose challenges to
automated systems, which are essential for precision forestry, biodiversity
monitoring, and the automation of forestry equipment. These tasks rely on
advanced perceptual capabilities, such as detection and fine-grained species
classification of individual trees. Yet, existing datasets are inadequate to
develop such perception systems, as they often focus on urban settings or a
limited number of species. To address this, we present SilvaScenes, a new
dataset for instance segmentation of tree species from under-canopy images.
Collected across five bioclimatic domains in Quebec, Canada, SilvaScenes
features 1476 trees from 24 species with annotations from forestry experts. We
demonstrate the relevance and challenging nature of our dataset by benchmarking
modern deep learning approaches for instance segmentation. Our results show
that, while tree segmentation is easy, with a top mean average precision (mAP)
of 67.65%, species classification remains a significant challenge with an mAP
of only 35.69%. Our dataset and source code will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然多模态大语言模型在具身AI和视觉-语言-动作模型中利用其广泛常识知识进行高级规划，但它们对物理工具的真正理解程度尚未量化。需要建立基准来评估这种理解能力。

Method: 构建PhysToolBench基准测试，作为视觉问答数据集，包含1000多个图像-文本对，评估三个难度级别：工具识别（识别工具主要功能）、工具理解（掌握工具操作原理）、工具创造（用周围物体创造新工具）。

Result: 对32个MLLM（包括专有、开源、专用具身模型和VLA骨干模型）的全面评估显示，在工具理解方面存在显著缺陷。

Conclusion: 当前MLLM在物理工具理解方面存在明显不足，需要进一步改进。作者提供了深入分析并提出了初步解决方案，代码和数据集已公开。

Abstract: The ability to use, understand, and create tools is a hallmark of human
intelligence, enabling sophisticated interaction with the physical world. For
any general-purpose intelligent agent to achieve true versatility, it must also
master these fundamental skills. While modern Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) leverage their extensive common knowledge for high-level planning in
embodied AI and in downstream Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, the extent
of their true understanding of physical tools remains unquantified. To bridge
this gap, we present PhysToolBench, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating
the comprehension of physical tools by MLLMs. Our benchmark is structured as a
Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset comprising over 1,000 image-text pairs.
It assesses capabilities across three distinct difficulty levels: (1) Tool
Recognition: Requiring the recognition of a tool's primary function. (2) Tool
Understanding: Testing the ability to grasp the underlying principles of a
tool's operation. (3) Tool Creation: Challenging the model to fashion a new
tool from surrounding objects when conventional options are unavailable. Our
comprehensive evaluation of 32 MLLMs-spanning proprietary, open-source,
specialized embodied, and backbones in VLAs-reveals a significant deficiency in
tool understanding. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis and propose
preliminary solutions. Code and dataset are publicly available.

Conclusion: 该后训练策略易于适配预训练模型，在医学图像转换任务中具有广泛应用潜力，能够有效提升临床诊断的可靠性。

Abstract: Image-to-Image translation models can help mitigate various challenges
inherent to medical image acquisition. Latent diffusion models (LDMs) leverage
efficient learning in compressed latent space and constitute the core of
state-of-the-art generative image models. However, this efficiency comes with a
trade-off, potentially compromising crucial pixel-level detail essential for
high-fidelity medical images. This limitation becomes particularly critical
when generating clinically significant structures, such as lesions, which often
occupy only a small portion of the image. Failure to accurately reconstruct
these regions can severely impact diagnostic reliability and clinical
decision-making. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel post-training
framework for LDMs in medical image-to-image translation by incorporating
lesion-aware medical pixel space objectives. This approach is essential, as it
not only enhances overall image quality but also improves the precision of
lesion delineation. We evaluate our framework on brain CT-to-MRI translation in
acute ischemic stroke patients, where early and accurate diagnosis is critical
for optimal treatment selection and improved patient outcomes. While diffusion
MRI is the gold standard for stroke diagnosis, its clinical utility is often
constrained by high costs and low accessibility. Using a dataset of 817
patients, we demonstrate that our framework improves overall image quality and
enhances lesion delineation when synthesizing DWI and ADC images from CT
perfusion scans, outperforming existing image-to-image translation models.
Furthermore, our post-training strategy is easily adaptable to pre-trained LDMs
and exhibits substantial potential for broader applications across diverse
medical image translation tasks.

Motivation: 现有法向量估计方法在建模细粒度几何结构方面存在不足，而现有的Mamba方法主要关注全局形状结构，对局部几何细节建模不够充分。

Method: 提出注意力驱动的层次特征融合方案自适应融合多尺度点云补丁特征，并设计补丁级状态空间模型将点云补丁建模为隐式超曲面。

Result: 在基准数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法在准确性、鲁棒性和灵活性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MambaH-Fit通过改进的局部几何建模能力，显著提升了点云法向量估计的性能。

Abstract: We present MambaH-Fit, a state space modelling framework tailored for
hyper-surface fitting-based point cloud normal estimation. Existing normal
estimation methods often fall short in modelling fine-grained geometric
structures, thereby limiting the accuracy of the predicted normals. Recently,
state space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have demonstrated strong
modelling capability by capturing long-range dependencies with linear
complexity and inspired adaptations to point cloud processing. However,
existing Mamba-based approaches primarily focus on understanding global shape
structures, leaving the modelling of local, fine-grained geometric details
largely under-explored. To address the issues above, we first introduce an
Attention-driven Hierarchical Feature Fusion (AHFF) scheme to adaptively fuse
multi-scale point cloud patch features, significantly enhancing geometric
context learning in local point cloud neighbourhoods. Building upon this, we
further propose Patch-wise State Space Model (PSSM) that models point cloud
patches as implicit hyper-surfaces via state dynamics, enabling effective
fine-grained geometric understanding for normal prediction. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing
ones in terms of accuracy, robustness, and flexibility. Ablation studies
further validate the contribution of the proposed components.

Conclusion: 该研究为无人机检测和跟踪技术的发展提供了有力支持，有效解决了复杂场景下的多目标跟踪挑战。

Abstract: The extensive application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in military
reconnaissance, environmental monitoring, and related domains has created an
urgent need for accurate and efficient multi-object tracking (MOT)
technologies, which are also essential for UAV situational awareness. However,
complex backgrounds, small-scale targets, and frequent occlusions and
interactions continue to challenge existing methods in terms of detection
accuracy and trajectory continuity. To address these issues, this paper
proposes the Global-Local Detection and Tracking (GL-DT) framework. It employs
a Spatio-Temporal Feature Fusion (STFF) module to jointly model motion and
appearance features, combined with a global-local collaborative detection
strategy, effectively enhancing small-target detection. Building upon this, the
JPTrack tracking algorithm is introduced to mitigate common issues such as ID
switches and trajectory fragmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed approach significantly improves the continuity and stability of
MOT while maintaining real-time performance, providing strong support for the
advancement of UAV detection and tracking technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiT模型参数过大导致推理开销大，现有剪枝方法会因模型容量减少导致性能严重下降，需要一种能保持模型容量的压缩方法。

Method: 将DiT块中的前馈网络替换为MoE层，减少62.5%FFN激活参数；提出混合块选择性激活DiT块；设计多步蒸馏流程，包括基于泰勒度量的专家初始化、负载均衡知识蒸馏和组特征损失优化。

Result: 将大型扩散变换器转换为MoE结构，减少60%激活参数，保持原始性能，在广泛实验中超越基于剪枝的方法。

Conclusion: Dense2MoE为高效文本到图像生成建立了新范式。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has demonstrated remarkable performance in
text-to-image generation; however, its large parameter size results in
substantial inference overhead. Existing parameter compression methods
primarily focus on pruning, but aggressive pruning often leads to severe
performance degradation due to reduced model capacity. To address this
limitation, we pioneer the transformation of a dense DiT into a Mixture of
Experts (MoE) for structured sparsification, reducing the number of activated
parameters while preserving model capacity. Specifically, we replace the
Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) in DiT Blocks with MoE layers, reducing the number
of activated parameters in the FFNs by 62.5\%. Furthermore, we propose the
Mixture of Blocks (MoB) to selectively activate DiT blocks, thereby further
enhancing sparsity. To ensure an effective dense-to-MoE conversion, we design a
multi-step distillation pipeline, incorporating Taylor metric-based expert
initialization, knowledge distillation with load balancing, and group feature
loss for MoB optimization. We transform large diffusion transformers (e.g.,
FLUX.1 [dev]) into an MoE structure, reducing activated parameters by 60\%
while maintaining original performance and surpassing pruning-based approaches
in extensive experiments. Overall, Dense2MoE establishes a new paradigm for
efficient text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Intelligent analysis of medical imaging plays a crucial role in assisting
clinical diagnosis, especially for identifying subtle pathological features.
This paper introduces a novel multi-branch ConvNeXt architecture designed
specifically for the nuanced challenges of medical image analysis. While
applied here to the specific problem of COVID-19 diagnosis, the methodology
offers a generalizable framework for classifying a wide range of pathologies
from CT scans. The proposed model incorporates a rigorous end-to-end pipeline,
from meticulous data preprocessing and augmentation to a disciplined two-phase
training strategy that leverages transfer learning effectively. The
architecture uniquely integrates features extracted from three parallel
branches: Global Average Pooling, Global Max Pooling, and a new
Attention-weighted Pooling mechanism. The model was trained and validated on a
combined dataset of 2,609 CT slices derived from two distinct datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate a superior performance on the validation set,
achieving a final ROC-AUC of 0.9937, a validation accuracy of 0.9757, and an
F1-score of 0.9825 for COVID-19 cases, outperforming all previously reported
models on this dataset. These findings indicate that a modern, multi-branch
architecture, coupled with careful data handling, can achieve performance
comparable to or exceeding contemporary state-of-the-art models, thereby
proving the efficacy of advanced deep learning techniques for robust medical
diagnostics.

TL;DR: SOS是一个简单可扩展的数据合成流水线，通过目标中心组合策略将高质量合成目标片段粘贴到新图像中，使用结构化布局先验和生成式重光照，产生准确多样的掩码、边界框和指代表达式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉分组（实例分割、视觉定位和目标检测）需要大量标注数据，但真实数据集成本高、覆盖偏差大且难以扩展。合成数据有潜力但缺乏灵活性、准确性和组合多样性。

Method: 基于目标中心组合策略的数据合成流水线，使用结构化布局先验和生成式重光照技术，将高质量合成目标片段粘贴到新图像中。

Result: 在100,000张合成图像上训练的模型在检测和定位任务上优于在更大真实图像数据集（如GRIT和V3Det）上训练的模型：LVIS检测提升+10.9 AP，gRefCOCO定位提升+8.4 N_Acc。在有限真实数据场景下表现更佳。

Conclusion: SOS支持可控数据集构建，在低数据和封闭词汇设置下改善泛化能力。将LVIS和COCO与合成目标片段增强可在各种真实数据规模下获得强劲性能，在极端有限真实数据下增益更大。

Abstract: Visual grouping -- operationalized via instance segmentation, visual
grounding, and object detection -- underpins applications from robotic
perception to photo editing. Large annotated datasets are costly, biased in
coverage, and hard to scale. Synthetic data are promising but often lack
flexibility, accuracy, and compositional diversity.
  We present SOS, a simple and scalable data synthesis pipeline based on an
object-centric composition strategy. It pastes high-quality synthetic object
segments into new images using structured layout priors and generative
relighting, producing accurate and diverse masks, boxes, and referring
expressions. Models trained on 100000 synthetic images from SOS outperform
those trained on larger real-image datasets such as GRIT (20M) and V3Det (200K)
on detection and grounding tasks, achieving +10.9 AP on LVIS detection and +8.4
$N_{\text{Acc}}$ on gRefCOCO grounding. SOS enables controllable dataset
construction and improves generalization in both low-data and closed-vocabulary
settings. Augmenting LVIS and COCO with synthetic object segments yields strong
performance across real-data scales and even larger gains under extremely
limited real data (for example, +3.83 $AP_{\text{rare}}$ on LVIS instance
segmentation and +6.59 AP with a 1 percent COCO setup). This controllability
also supports targeted data generation for challenging intra-class referring in
visual grounding.

Conclusion: 多模态扩散增强策略有效提升了细胞和细胞核分割模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力，为生成模型在计算病理学中的广泛应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Scarcity of annotated data, particularly for rare or atypical morphologies,
present significant challenges for cell and nuclei segmentation in
computational pathology. While manual annotation is labor-intensive and costly,
synthetic data offers a cost-effective alternative. We introduce a Multimodal
Semantic Diffusion Model (MSDM) for generating realistic pixel-precise
image-mask pairs for cell and nuclei segmentation. By conditioning the
generative process with cellular/nuclear morphologies (using horizontal and
vertical maps), RGB color characteristics, and BERT-encoded assay/indication
metadata, MSDM generates datasests with desired morphological properties. These
heterogeneous modalities are integrated via multi-head cross-attention,
enabling fine-grained control over the generated images. Quantitative analysis
demonstrates that synthetic images closely match real data, with low
Wasserstein distances between embeddings of generated and real images under
matching biological conditions. The incorporation of these synthetic samples,
exemplified by columnar cells, significantly improves segmentation model
accuracy on columnar cells. This strategy systematically enriches data sets,
directly targeting model deficiencies. We highlight the effectiveness of
multimodal diffusion-based augmentation for advancing the robustness and
generalizability of cell and nuclei segmentation models. Thereby, we pave the
way for broader application of generative models in computational pathology.

Motivation: 传统的正交矩图像表示方法存在高计算复杂度和数值不稳定问题，特别是在大阶数时，Zernike和伪Zernike矩需要耦合的径向-角向处理，导致效率低下。

Method: 使用张量积构造离散余弦变换（DCT）径向基和傅里叶谐波角向基，实现独立的径向和角向处理，构建完全可分离的核函数。

Conclusion: PSepT在数值稳定性、计算效率和分类性能方面表现优异，同时保持精确重构，为高阶矩分析开辟了新的可能性。

Abstract: Orthogonal moment-based image representations are fundamental in computer
vision, but classical methods suffer from high computational complexity and
numerical instability at large orders. Zernike and pseudo-Zernike moments, for
instance, require coupled radial-angular processing that precludes efficient
factorization, resulting in $\mathcal{O}(n^3N^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n^6N^2)$
complexity and $\mathcal{O}(N^4)$ condition number scaling for the $n$th-order
moments on an $N\times N$ image. We introduce \textbf{PSepT} (Polar Separable
Transform), a separable orthogonal transform that overcomes the
non-separability barrier in polar coordinates. PSepT achieves complete kernel
factorization via tensor-product construction of Discrete Cosine Transform
(DCT) radial bases and Fourier harmonic angular bases, enabling independent
radial and angular processing. This separable design reduces computational
complexity to $\mathcal{O}(N^2 \log N)$, memory requirements to
$\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, and condition number scaling to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$,
representing exponential improvements over polynomial approaches. PSepT
exhibits orthogonality, completeness, energy conservation, and
rotation-covariance properties. Experimental results demonstrate better
numerical stability, computational efficiency, and competitive classification
performance on structured datasets, while preserving exact reconstruction. The
separable framework enables high-order moment analysis previously infeasible
with classical methods, opening new possibilities for robust image analysis
applications.

*Aziz Bacha,Thomas George*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出训练特征归因方法，将测试预测与特定训练图像的特定区域联系起来，提供对深度模型内部工作原理的新见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络通常被视为不透明系统，需要可解释性方法来提高信任和问责。现有方法通常将测试时预测归因于输入特征或影响训练样本，但认为这两种视角应该联合研究。

Method: 探索训练特征归因方法，该方法将测试预测与特定训练图像的特定区域联系起来。

Result: 在视觉数据集上的实验表明，训练特征归因产生细粒度的、测试特定的解释：识别导致错误分类的有害示例，并揭示传统归因方法未能暴露的虚假相关性（如基于补丁的捷径）。

Conclusion: 训练特征归因方法提供了对深度模型内部工作原理的新见解，能够识别传统方法无法发现的模式和问题。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are often considered opaque systems, prompting the need
for explainability methods to improve trust and accountability. Existing
approaches typically attribute test-time predictions either to input features
(e.g., pixels in an image) or to influential training examples. We argue that
both perspectives should be studied jointly. This work explores *training
feature attribution*, which links test predictions to specific regions of
specific training images and thereby provides new insights into the inner
workings of deep models. Our experiments on vision datasets show that training
feature attribution yields fine-grained, test-specific explanations: it
identifies harmful examples that drive misclassifications and reveals spurious
correlations, such as patch-based shortcuts, that conventional attribution
methods fail to expose.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图像的支气管镜拓扑定位管道，无需患者CT扫描即可在手术过程中提供导航辅助，仅使用幻影数据训练且具有良好的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前支气管镜导航技术依赖患者CT扫描和额外传感器，需要额外设置、扫描和培训。准确度量定位并非总是必需，拓扑定位通常足以辅助外科医生导航。

Method: 开发基于图像的支气管镜拓扑定位管道，仅使用幻影数据进行训练，无需真实患者数据标注，避免了高昂的标注成本。

Result: 该方法在结果上超越了现有方法，特别是在真实数据测试序列上表现优异。

Conclusion: 该图像支气管镜拓扑定位管道提供了一种无需患者CT扫描的导航辅助方案，具有成本效益和良好的泛化性能。

Abstract: Video bronchoscopy is a fundamental procedure in respiratory medicine, where
medical experts navigate through the bronchial tree of a patient to diagnose or
operate the patient. Surgeons need to determine the position of the scope as
they go through the airway until they reach the area of interest. This task is
very challenging for practitioners due to the complex bronchial tree structure
and varying doctor experience and training. Navigation assistance to locate the
bronchoscope during the procedure can improve its outcome. Currently used
techniques for navigational guidance commonly rely on previous CT scans of the
patient to obtain a 3D model of the airway, followed by tracking of the scope
with additional sensors or image registration. These methods obtain accurate
locations but imply additional setup, scans and training. Accurate metric
localization is not always required, and a topological localization with regard
to a generic airway model can often suffice to assist the surgeon with
navigation. We present an image-based bronchoscopy topological localization
pipeline to provide navigation assistance during the procedure, with no need of
patient CT scan. Our approach is trained only on phantom data, eliminating the
high cost of real data labeling, and presents good generalization capabilities.
The results obtained surpass existing methods, particularly on real data test
sequences.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需真实图像、仅通过目标领域名称就能合成多样化对象实例的新方法，用于解决实例级识别(ILR)中数据标注困难的问题，显著提升了跨多个领域的检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实例级识别(ILR)需要识别具体对象而非宽泛类别，但精细化的特性使得创建大规模标注数据集极具挑战，限制了ILR在实际应用中的广泛使用。

Method: 通过合成方法从多个领域生成多样化的对象实例，包含不同条件和背景，构建大规模训练集。这是首个专门解决ILR特定挑战且不依赖任何真实图像的自动数据合成方法。

Result: 在基础视觉模型上使用生成数据进行微调后，在跨越多个领域的七个ILR基准测试中显著提升了检索性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模数据收集和整理提供了高效且有效的替代方案，开创了ILR的新范式，仅需目标领域名称作为输入，为实际应用开辟了广阔前景。

Abstract: Instance-level recognition (ILR) focuses on identifying individual objects
rather than broad categories, offering the highest granularity in image
classification. However, this fine-grained nature makes creating large-scale
annotated datasets challenging, limiting ILR's real-world applicability across
domains. To overcome this, we introduce a novel approach that synthetically
generates diverse object instances from multiple domains under varied
conditions and backgrounds, forming a large-scale training set. Unlike prior
work on automatic data synthesis, our method is the first to address
ILR-specific challenges without relying on any real images. Fine-tuning
foundation vision models on the generated data significantly improves retrieval
performance across seven ILR benchmarks spanning multiple domains. Our approach
offers a new, efficient, and effective alternative to extensive data collection
and curation, introducing a new ILR paradigm where the only input is the names
of the target domains, unlocking a wide range of real-world applications.

*Yuchen Zhang,Yao Lu,Johannes Betz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TARO是一个新颖的开放世界检测框架，不仅识别未知物体，还能将其分类到语义层次结构中的粗粒度父类别，相比传统仅标记为'Unknown'的方法提供更细粒度的信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统目标检测器局限于'封闭世界'假设，无法处理现实场景中的未知物体。现有的开放集检测方法仅将未知实例标记为'Unknown'，这在安全关键场景中信息不足，需要更细粒度的分类来支持决策。

Method: TARO采用独特架构：基于sparsemax的头部建模物体性，层次引导的重标记组件提供辅助监督，分类模块学习层次关系。

Result: 实验显示TARO能将高达29.9%的未知物体分类到有意义的粗粒度类别，显著减少未知与已知类别间的混淆，在未知召回率和已知mAP方面均具竞争力。

Conclusion: TARO框架成功地将未知物体分类到语义层次结构中的粗粒度父类别，为安全关键应用提供了更细粒度的未知物体理解能力。

Abstract: Modern object detectors are largely confined to a "closed-world" assumption,
limiting them to a predefined set of classes and posing risks when encountering
novel objects in real-world scenarios. While open-set detection methods aim to
address this by identifying such instances as 'Unknown', this is often
insufficient. Rather than treating all unknowns as a single class, assigning
them more descriptive subcategories can enhance decision-making in
safety-critical contexts. For example, identifying an object as an 'Unknown
Animal' (requiring an urgent stop) versus 'Unknown Debris' (requiring a safe
lane change) is far more useful than just 'Unknown' in autonomous driving. To
bridge this gap, we introduce TARO, a novel detection framework that not only
identifies unknown objects but also classifies them into coarse parent
categories within a semantic hierarchy. TARO employs a unique architecture with
a sparsemax-based head for modeling objectness, a hierarchy-guided relabeling
component that provides auxiliary supervision, and a classification module that
learns hierarchical relationships. Experiments show TARO can categorize up to
29.9% of unknowns into meaningful coarse classes, significantly reduce
confusion between unknown and known classes, and achieve competitive
performance in both unknown recall and known mAP. Code will be made available.

TL;DR: 提出了在线视频深度估计方法oVDA，通过借鉴LLM的缓存和掩码技术，解决了现有方法无法在线处理的问题，在精度和VRAM使用上优于所有竞争方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Video Depth Anything (VDA)方法依赖批处理，无法在在线设置中使用，限制了其在实时系统中的应用。

Method: 借鉴大语言模型技术，在推理时缓存潜在特征，在训练时使用帧掩码技术，实现高效的在线视频深度估计。

Result: oVDA在精度和VRAM使用上优于所有竞争方法，在NVIDIA A100上达到42 FPS，在Jetson边缘设备上达到20 FPS。

Conclusion: oVDA成功实现了高效的在线视频深度估计，特别适合边缘设备部署，将发布代码和编译脚本。

Abstract: Depth estimation from monocular video has become a key component of many
real-world computer vision systems. Recently, Video Depth Anything (VDA) has
demonstrated strong performance on long video sequences. However, it relies on
batch-processing which prohibits its use in an online setting. In this work, we
overcome this limitation and introduce online VDA (oVDA). The key innovation is
to employ techniques from Large Language Models (LLMs), namely, caching latent
features during inference and masking frames at training. Our oVDA method
outperforms all competing online video depth estimation methods in both
accuracy and VRAM usage. Low VRAM usage is particularly important for
deployment on edge devices. We demonstrate that oVDA runs at 42 FPS on an
NVIDIA A100 and at 20 FPS on an NVIDIA Jetson edge device. We will release
both, code and compilation scripts, making oVDA easy to deploy on low-power
hardware.

Abstract: Cricket shot classification from video sequences remains a challenging
problem in sports video analysis, requiring effective modeling of both spatial
and temporal features. This paper presents the first comprehensive baseline
study comparing seven different deep learning approaches across four distinct
research paradigms for cricket shot classification. We implement and
systematically evaluate traditional CNN-LSTM architectures, attention-based
models, vision transformers, transfer learning approaches, and modern
EfficientNet-GRU combinations on a unified benchmark. A critical finding of our
study is the significant performance gap between claims in academic literature
and practical implementation results. While previous papers reported accuracies
of 96\% (Balaji LRCN), 99.2\% (IJERCSE), and 93\% (Sensors), our standardized
re-implementations achieve 46.0\%, 55.6\%, and 57.7\% respectively. Our modern
SOTA approach, combining EfficientNet-B0 with a GRU-based temporal model,
achieves 92.25\% accuracy, demonstrating that substantial improvements are
possible with modern architectures and systematic optimization. All
implementations follow modern MLOps practices with PyTorch Lightning, providing
a reproducible research platform that exposes the critical importance of
standardized evaluation protocols in sports video analysis research.

Conclusion: VCBM框架为自动驾驶系统提供了内在可解释的驾驶员意图预测能力，通过概念瓶颈模型和多模态数据集实现了更好的决策过程可解释性，有助于提升人机交互的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Autonomous driving (AD) systems are becoming increasingly capable of handling
complex tasks, mainly due to recent advances in deep learning and AI. As
interactions between autonomous systems and humans increase, the
interpretability of decision-making processes in driving systems becomes
increasingly crucial for ensuring safe driving operations. Successful
human-machine interaction requires understanding the underlying representations
of the environment and the driving task, which remains a significant challenge
in deep learning-based systems. To address this, we introduce the task of
interpretability in maneuver prediction before they occur for driver safety,
i.e., driver intent prediction (DIP), which plays a critical role in AD
systems. To foster research in interpretable DIP, we curate the eXplainable
Driving Action Anticipation Dataset (DAAD-X), a new multimodal, ego-centric
video dataset to provide hierarchical, high-level textual explanations as
causal reasoning for the driver's decisions. These explanations are derived
from both the driver's eye-gaze and the ego-vehicle's perspective. Next, we
propose Video Concept Bottleneck Model (VCBM), a framework that generates
spatio-temporally coherent explanations inherently, without relying on post-hoc
techniques. Finally, through extensive evaluations of the proposed VCBM on the
DAAD-X dataset, we demonstrate that transformer-based models exhibit greater
interpretability than conventional CNN-based models. Additionally, we introduce
a multilabel t-SNE visualization technique to illustrate the disentanglement
and causal correlation among multiple explanations. Our data, code and models
are available at: https://mukil07.github.io/VCBM.github.io/

TL;DR: Cattle-CLIP是一个基于多模态深度学习框架的牛只行为识别系统，通过语义线索提升视频特征识别性能，在监督学习下达到96.1%的准确率，并在少样本场景中展现良好泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 牛只行为是动物健康、生产力和福祉的重要指标。现有视频监测方法在数据稀缺的行为识别任务中存在性能限制，需要开发更有效的识别框架。

Method: 基于CLIP大模型开发Cattle-CLIP，添加时间整合模块，采用定制化数据增强策略和专门文本提示来解决预训练模型与真实监控视频之间的领域差异。

Result: 在监督设置下，Cattle-CLIP在六种行为识别中达到96.1%总体准确率，其中进食、饮水和站立反刍行为的召回率接近100%。在少样本场景中表现出稳健的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 多模态学习在农业和动物行为分析中具有巨大潜力，Cattle-CLIP为数据稀缺条件下的牛只行为识别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Cattle behaviour is a crucial indicator of an individual animal health,
productivity and overall well-being. Video-based monitoring, combined with deep
learning techniques, has become a mainstream approach in animal biometrics, and
it can offer high accuracy in some behaviour recognition tasks. We present
Cattle-CLIP, a multimodal deep learning framework for cattle behaviour
recognition, using semantic cues to improve the performance of video-based
visual feature recognition. It is adapted from the large-scale image-language
model CLIP by adding a temporal integration module. To address the domain gap
between web data used for the pre-trained model and real-world cattle
surveillance footage, we introduce tailored data augmentation strategies and
specialised text prompts. Cattle-CLIP is evaluated under both fully-supervised
and few-shot learning scenarios, with a particular focus on data-scarce
behaviour recognition - an important yet under-explored goal in livestock
monitoring. To evaluate the proposed method, we release the CattleBehaviours6
dataset, which comprises six types of indoor behaviours: feeding, drinking,
standing-self-grooming, standing-ruminating, lying-self-grooming and
lying-ruminating. The dataset consists of 1905 clips collected from our John
Oldacre Centre dairy farm research platform housing 200 Holstein-Friesian cows.
Experiments show that Cattle-CLIP achieves 96.1% overall accuracy across six
behaviours in a supervised setting, with nearly 100% recall for feeding,
drinking and standing-ruminating behaviours, and demonstrates robust
generalisation with limited data in few-shot scenarios, highlighting the
potential of multimodal learning in agricultural and animal behaviour analysis.

the quality of images and videos, posing serious challenges to intelligent
transportation systems (ITS) that rely on visual input. These degradations
affect critical applications including autonomous driving, traffic monitoring,

further classified based on their scope: single-task models,
multi-task/multi-weather systems, and all-in-one frameworks capable of handling
diverse degradations. In addition, we discuss day and night time restoration
challenges, benchmark datasets, and evaluation protocols. The survey concludes
with an in-depth discussion on limitations in current research and outlines
future directions such as mixed/compound-degradation restoration, real-time

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决时间分辨系统中由于传感器量子效率低和噪声水平高导致的3D重建挑战，特别是在长距离或复杂场景下。

Method: 设计了时空自注意力编码器和时空交叉注意力解码器，通过多尺度特征处理来探索局部和全局相关性，并构建了TRT-LOS和TRT-NLOS两种具体实现。

Result: 在合成数据和真实数据上的广泛实验表明，两种实现都显著优于现有方法，并贡献了大规模合成LOS数据集和真实NLOS测量数据。

Conclusion: TRT架构在光子效率成像中表现出优越的3D重建性能，为LOS和NLOS成像提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Transient measurements, captured by the timeresolved systems, are widely
employed in photon-efficient reconstruction tasks, including line-of-sight
(LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging. However, challenges persist in
their 3D reconstruction due to the low quantum efficiency of sensors and the
high noise levels, particularly for long-range or complex scenes. To boost the
3D reconstruction performance in photon-efficient imaging, we propose a generic
Time-Resolved Transformer (TRT) architecture. Different from existing
transformers designed for high-dimensional data, TRT has two elaborate
attention designs tailored for the spatio-temporal transient measurements.
Specifically, the spatio-temporal self-attention encoders explore both local
and global correlations within transient data by splitting or downsampling
input features into different scales. Then, the spatio-temporal cross attention
decoders integrate the local and global features in the token space, resulting
in deep features with high representation capabilities. Building on TRT, we
develop two task-specific embodiments: TRT-LOS for LOS imaging and TRT-NLOS for
NLOS imaging. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both embodiments
significantly outperform existing methods on synthetic data and real-world data
captured by different imaging systems. In addition, we contribute a
large-scale, high-resolution synthetic LOS dataset with various noise levels
and capture a set of real-world NLOS measurements using a custom-built imaging
system, enhancing the data diversity in this field. Code and datasets are
available at https://github.com/Depth2World/TRT.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了低成本MLLM在医疗应用中的潜力，为未来MLLM在医疗视频理解领域的应用提供了重要技术贡献。

Abstract: Shoulder disorders, such as frozen shoulder (a.k.a., adhesive capsulitis),
are common conditions affecting the health of people worldwide, and have a high
incidence rate among the elderly and workers engaged in repetitive shoulder
tasks. In regions with scarce medical resources, achieving early and accurate
diagnosis poses significant challenges, and there is an urgent need for
low-cost and easily scalable auxiliary diagnostic solutions. This research
introduces videos captured by consumer-grade devices as the basis for
diagnosis, reducing the cost for users. We focus on the innovative application
of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the preliminary diagnosis of
shoulder disorders and propose a Hybrid Motion Video Diagnosis framework
(HMVDx). This framework divides the two tasks of action understanding and
disease diagnosis, which are respectively completed by two MLLMs. In addition
to traditional evaluation indicators, this work proposes a novel metric called
Usability Index by the logical process of medical decision-making (action
recognition, movement diagnosis, and final diagnosis). This index evaluates the
effectiveness of MLLMs in the medical field from the perspective of the entire
medical diagnostic pathway, revealing the potential value of low-cost MLLMs in
medical applications for medical practitioners. In experimental comparisons,
the accuracy of HMVDx in diagnosing shoulder joint injuries has increased by
79.6\% compared with direct video diagnosis, a significant technical
contribution to future research on the application of MLLMs for video
understanding in the medical field.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Stable Video Infinity (SVI)方法，能够生成无限长度视频，具有高时间一致性、合理的场景转换和可控的流式故事情节。通过错误回收微调技术，让Diffusion Transformer从自身错误中学习，解决训练与推理之间的假设差距问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长视频生成方法局限于单提示外推，产生同质化场景和重复运动。根本挑战在于训练假设（看到干净数据）与自回归推理现实（基于自生成、易出错输出）之间的关键差异。

Method: 采用错误回收微调，通过闭环回收将DiT自生成的错误转化为监督提示，鼓励模型主动识别和纠正自身错误。包括注入历史错误干预干净输入、使用一步双向积分高效近似预测、动态将错误存入重放内存等步骤。

Result: SVI能够将视频从秒级扩展到无限时长，无需额外推理成本，同时兼容多种条件（音频、骨架、文本流）。在三个基准测试中验证了其多功能性和最先进性能。

Conclusion: SVI通过错误回收微调有效解决了长视频生成中的错误累积和假设差距问题，实现了无限长度视频生成，在一致性和创造性方面都表现出色。

Abstract: We propose Stable Video Infinity (SVI) that is able to generate
infinite-length videos with high temporal consistency, plausible scene
transitions, and controllable streaming storylines. While existing long-video
methods attempt to mitigate accumulated errors via handcrafted anti-drifting
(e.g., modified noise scheduler, frame anchoring), they remain limited to
single-prompt extrapolation, producing homogeneous scenes with repetitive
motions. We identify that the fundamental challenge extends beyond error
accumulation to a critical discrepancy between the training assumption (seeing
clean data) and the test-time autoregressive reality (conditioning on
self-generated, error-prone outputs). To bridge this hypothesis gap, SVI
incorporates Error-Recycling Fine-Tuning, a new type of efficient training that
recycles the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)'s self-generated errors into
supervisory prompts, thereby encouraging DiT to actively identify and correct
its own errors. This is achieved by injecting, collecting, and banking errors
through closed-loop recycling, autoregressively learning from error-injected
feedback. Specifically, we (i) inject historical errors made by DiT to
intervene on clean inputs, simulating error-accumulated trajectories in flow
matching; (ii) efficiently approximate predictions with one-step bidirectional
integration and calculate errors with residuals; (iii) dynamically bank errors
into replay memory across discretized timesteps, which are resampled for new
input. SVI is able to scale videos from seconds to infinite durations with no
additional inference cost, while remaining compatible with diverse conditions
(e.g., audio, skeleton, and text streams). We evaluate SVI on three benchmarks,
including consistent, creative, and conditional settings, thoroughly verifying
its versatility and state-of-the-art role.

To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{TEMA-LLM} (\textit{Tag-Enriched
Multi-Attention with Large Language Models}), a practical and effective
framework that integrates \textit{Large Language Models (LLMs)} for semantic
tag generation and enrichment. Specifically, TEMA-LLM employs LLMs to assign
domain-aware prompts and generate descriptive tags from item titles and
descriptions. The resulting tag embeddings are fused with item identifiers as
well as textual and visual features to construct enhanced item representations.
A \textit{Tag-Enriched Multi-Attention} mechanism is then introduced to jointly
model user preferences within and across domains, enabling the system to
capture complex and evolving consumer interests. Extensive experiments on four
large-scale e-commerce datasets demonstrate that TEMA-LLM consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the benefits of LLM-based
semantic tagging and multi-attention integration for consumer-facing
recommendation systems. The proposed approach highlights the potential of LLMs
to advance intelligent, user-centric services in the field of consumer
electronics.

*Yuying Li,Siyi Qian,Hao Liang,Leqi Zheng,Ruichuan An,Yongzhen Guo,Wentao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了CapGeo框架，通过将几何图形转换为文本描述来增强多模态大语言模型的几何推理能力，并创建了CapGeo-Bench数据集来评估几何描述模型的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的多模态大语言模型在几何推理方面表现不佳，瓶颈在于理解几何图形而非推理本身。由于几何图形可以用简洁的文本形式描述，将视觉内容转换为文本描述是一个有前景的方向。

Method: 引入CapGeo框架，通过几何图形描述辅助推理来桥接视觉和文本模态。同时提出CapGeo-Bench数据集，包含4,641个精心挑选的图形-描述对，并采用基于关键点的评估指标。

Result: 实验显示配备描述后模型性能显著提升：Qwen2.5-VL-72B从8.6%提升到59.0%，Claude-Opus-4从44.8%提升到73.0%。提出的评估指标与下游CapGeo性能高度相关。

Conclusion: 该框架和基准为推进多模态大语言模型的几何推理能力开辟了新途径，证明了文本描述在几何推理中的重要作用。

Abstract: Geometric reasoning remains a core challenge for Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). Even the most advanced closed-source systems, such as GPT-O3
and Gemini-2.5-Pro, still struggle to solve geometry problems reliably, despite
exhibiting strong textual reasoning abilities on tasks like the International
Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). This gap suggests that the bottleneck lies in
understanding geometric diagrams rather than reasoning itself. Since geometric
figures can often be faithfully described in concise textual form, converting
visual content into captions offers a promising direction. Motivated by this
insight, we introduce CapGeo, a caption-assisted reasoning framework that
bridges visual and textual modalities. Experiments show substantial
improvements when models are equipped with captions: Qwen2.5-VL-72B improves
from 8.6% (vision-only) to 59.0%, while Claude-Opus-4 rises from 44.8% to
73.0%. To systematically evaluate and identify high-quality geometric
captioning models, we further propose CapGeo-Bench, a dataset of 4,641 curated
figure-caption pairs. Crucially, CapGeo-Bench incorporates a keypoint-based
evaluation metric that correlates strongly with downstream CapGeo performance,
enabling reliable assessment of geometric captioning ability. Together, our
framework and benchmark highlight a new pathway toward advancing geometric
reasoning in MLLMs.

*Alina Elena Baia,Alessio Xompero,Andrea Cavallaro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文建立了图像隐私分类的零样本基准，评估了顶级开源视觉语言模型(VLMs)在隐私预测任务上的表现。与直觉相反，尽管VLMs资源消耗大，但在隐私预测准确性上仍落后于专门的较小模型，不过对图像扰动的鲁棒性更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文献倾向于采用为通用任务设计的大型视觉语言模型(VLMs)，这可能导致忽视专门构建模型设定的性能上限。需要系统评估来比较不同方法在图像隐私预测任务上的表现。

Method: 建立零样本基准用于图像隐私分类的公平比较，评估前三名开源VLMs，使用任务对齐的提示，并与已建立的纯视觉和多模态方法对比性能、效率和鲁棒性。

Result: VLMs尽管参数数量多、推理速度慢，但在隐私预测准确性上落后于专门的较小模型。然而，VLMs对图像扰动表现出更高的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 专门构建的模型在图像隐私预测任务上仍具有优势，而VLMs虽然在通用性方面有优势，但在特定隐私预测任务上尚未超越专门模型。

Abstract: While specialized learning-based models have historically dominated image
privacy prediction, the current literature increasingly favours adopting large
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) designed for generic tasks. This trend risks
overlooking the performance ceiling set by purpose-built models due to a lack
of systematic evaluation. To address this problem, we establish a zero-shot
benchmark for image privacy classification, enabling a fair comparison. We
evaluate the top-3 open-source VLMs, according to a privacy benchmark, using
task-aligned prompts and we contrast their performance, efficiency, and
robustness against established vision-only and multi-modal methods.
Counter-intuitively, our results show that VLMs, despite their
resource-intensive nature in terms of high parameter count and slower
inference, currently lag behind specialized, smaller models in privacy
prediction accuracy. We also find that VLMs exhibit higher robustness to image
perturbations.

TL;DR: 使用离散语义熵(DSE)来检测和拒绝可能产生幻觉的问题，可以显著提高黑盒视觉语言模型在放射学图像视觉问答中的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 黑盒视觉语言模型在放射学图像问答中容易产生幻觉，需要一种可靠的方法来检测和过滤这些问题以提高诊断准确性。

Method: 使用GPT-4o和GPT-4.1模型，通过高温采样生成多个回答，利用双向蕴含检查将语义等效的回答分组，计算离散语义熵来量化语义不一致性。

Result: 在过滤掉高熵问题(DSE > 0.3)后，GPT-4o的准确率从51.7%提升到76.3%，GPT-4.1从54.8%提升到63.8%，且统计显著。

Conclusion: 离散语义熵能够可靠地检测黑盒视觉语言模型中的幻觉，显著提高诊断答案的准确性，为临床VLM应用提供了有效的过滤策略。

Abstract: To determine whether using discrete semantic entropy (DSE) to reject
questions likely to generate hallucinations can improve the accuracy of
black-box vision-language models (VLMs) in radiologic image based visual
question answering (VQA). This retrospective study evaluated DSE using two
publicly available, de-identified datasets: (i) the VQA-Med 2019 benchmark (500
images with clinical questions and short-text answers) and (ii) a diagnostic
radiology dataset (206 cases: 60 computed tomography scans, 60 magnetic
resonance images, 60 radiographs, 26 angiograms) with corresponding
ground-truth diagnoses. GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 answered each question 15 times
using a temperature of 1.0. Baseline accuracy was determined using
low-temperature answers (temperature 0.1). Meaning-equivalent responses were
grouped using bidirectional entailment checks, and DSE was computed from the
relative frequencies of the resulting semantic clusters. Accuracy was
recalculated after excluding questions with DSE > 0.6 or > 0.3. p-values and
95% confidence intervals were obtained using bootstrap resampling and a
Bonferroni-corrected threshold of p < .004 for statistical significance. Across
706 image-question pairs, baseline accuracy was 51.7% for GPT-4o and 54.8% for
GPT-4.1. After filtering out high-entropy questions (DSE > 0.3), accuracy on
the remaining questions was 76.3% (retained questions: 334/706) for GPT-4o and
63.8% (retained questions: 499/706) for GPT-4.1 (both p < .001). Accuracy gains
were observed across both datasets and largely remained statistically
significant after Bonferroni correction. DSE enables reliable hallucination
detection in black-box VLMs by quantifying semantic inconsistency. This method
significantly improves diagnostic answer accuracy and offers a filtering
strategy for clinical VLM applications.

Motivation: 当前交互式医学图像分割评估方法不一致且不切实际，阻碍了公平比较和真实性能评估。

Method: 提出临床基础的评估任务和指标定义方法，构建标准化评估框架软件，评估多种最先进算法在异构复杂任务上的表现。

Result: 发现最小化交互信息损失对模型鲁棒性关键，自适应缩放提升鲁棒性和收敛速度，验证提示行为差异导致性能下降，2D方法在板状图像表现好但3D上下文对大型不规则目标有帮助，非医学领域模型在低对比度和复杂形状下性能下降。

Conclusion: 建立了标准化的临床相关评估框架，揭示了交互式分割算法的关键性能因素，为未来算法开发和评估提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Interactive segmentation is a promising strategy for building robust,
generalisable algorithms for volumetric medical image segmentation. However,
inconsistent and clinically unrealistic evaluation hinders fair comparison and
misrepresents real-world performance. We propose a clinically grounded
methodology for defining evaluation tasks and metrics, and built a software
framework for constructing standardised evaluation pipelines. We evaluate
state-of-the-art algorithms across heterogeneous and complex tasks and observe
that (i) minimising information loss when processing user interactions is
critical for model robustness, (ii) adaptive-zooming mechanisms boost
robustness and speed convergence, (iii) performance drops if validation
prompting behaviour/budgets differ from training, (iv) 2D methods perform well
with slab-like images and coarse targets, but 3D context helps with large or
irregularly shaped targets, (v) performance of non-medical-domain models (e.g.
SAM2) degrades with poor contrast and complex shapes.

Motivation: 现有基于LLM的采样策略要么依赖手工启发式方法忽略时序线索，要么使用外部关键帧模型增加系统复杂度，需要更有效的统一解决方案。

Result: 该方法在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，代码和模型将公开。

Conclusion: 所提出的统一框架能够有效处理视频目标分割任务，通过联合优化时序语句定位和分割任务，实现了更好的时序理解和分割精度。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RefVOS) seeks to segment target objects
in videos guided by natural language descriptions, demanding both temporal
reasoning and fine-grained visual comprehension. Existing sampling strategies
for LLM-based approaches typically rely on either handcrafted heuristics or
external keyframe models. The former often overlooks essential temporal cues,
while the latter increases system complexity. To address this, we propose a
unified framework that jointly optimizes Temporal Sentence Grounding (TSG) and
RefVOS, naturally incorporating key moment grounding capability. During
training, we introduce a novel TSG paradigm that employs a dedicated
\texttt{[FIND]} token for key moment identification through temporal token
similarity matching, thereby avoiding the need for external timestamp
encodings. For inference, we design a Moment-Centric Sampling (MCS) strategy
that densely samples informative moments while sparsely sampling non-essential
frames, preserving both motion details and global context. To further enhance
tracking stability, we develop Bidirectional Anchor-updated Propagation (BAP),
which leverages the most relevant moment as start point for high-quality mask
initialization and dynamically updates at sampled points to mitigate
accumulated errors. Code and model will be available at:

TL;DR: StreamingVLM是一个专为实时处理无限视觉输入而设计的视觉语言模型，通过统一的训练和推理框架，利用紧凑的KV缓存机制实现高效的长视频理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在处理无限视频流时面临计算成本高、延迟大和内存使用过多的问题，需要一种能够实时稳定理解长视频的解决方案。

Method: 采用统一的训练推理框架，在推理时维护包含注意力sink状态、近期视觉token短窗口和近期文本token长窗口的紧凑KV缓存，通过简单的监督微调策略在短重叠视频块上应用完整注意力来模拟推理时的注意力模式。

Result: 在Inf-Streams-Eval基准测试中，StreamingVLM以66.18%的胜率击败GPT-4O mini，在单个NVIDIA H100上保持高达8 FPS的稳定实时性能，同时在LongVideoBench和OVOBench Realtime上分别提升4.30和5.96分。

Conclusion: StreamingVLM成功解决了长视频处理的效率和延迟问题，通过创新的KV缓存机制和训练策略实现了实时稳定的无限视觉输入理解，同时提升了通用视觉问答能力。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) could power real-time assistants and autonomous
agents, but they face a critical challenge: understanding near-infinite video
streams without escalating latency and memory usage. Processing entire videos
with full attention leads to quadratic computational costs and poor performance
on long videos. Meanwhile, simple sliding window methods are also flawed, as
they either break coherence or suffer from high latency due to redundant
recomputation. In this paper, we introduce StreamingVLM, a model designed for
real-time, stable understanding of infinite visual input. Our approach is a
unified framework that aligns training with streaming inference. During
inference, we maintain a compact KV cache by reusing states of attention sinks,
a short window of recent vision tokens, and a long window of recent text
tokens. This streaming ability is instilled via a simple supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) strategy that applies full attention on short, overlapped video chunks,
which effectively mimics the inference-time attention pattern without training
on prohibitively long contexts. For evaluation, we build Inf-Streams-Eval, a
new benchmark with videos averaging over two hours that requires dense,
per-second alignment between frames and text. On Inf-Streams-Eval, StreamingVLM
achieves a 66.18% win rate against GPT-4O mini and maintains stable, real-time
performance at up to 8 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100. Notably, our SFT strategy
also enhances general VQA abilities without any VQA-specific fine-tuning,
improving performance on LongVideoBench by +4.30 and OVOBench Realtime by
+5.96. Code is available at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/streaming-vlm.

TL;DR: 本文提出了视觉感知策略优化(VPPO)，一种基于token感知的新型策略梯度算法，通过重新加权轨迹优势并聚焦于感知关键token来增强多模态推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态推理方法在RLVR优化过程中忽视了视觉感知的关键作用，需要从token感知的新视角探索多模态RLVR。

Method: 提出了VPPO算法，通过双重机制：基于整体视觉依赖重新加权轨迹优势，并仅对感知关键token进行策略更新。

Result: 在8个感知和推理基准测试中，VPPO相比领先的开源RL调优模型取得了显著提升，在7B和32B模型规模上均验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 研究不仅为分析多模态RLVR建立了新的token级感知视角，还提出了一种新颖有效的优化策略来显著增强LVLMs的多模态推理能力。

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has advanced the
reasoning capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), most existing
methods in multimodal reasoning neglect the critical role of visual perception
within the RLVR optimization process. In this paper, we undertake a pioneering
exploration of multimodal RLVR through the novel perspective of token
perception, which measures the visual dependency of each generated token. With
a granular analysis of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) processes, we uncover two key
insights: first, token perception in a rollout trajectory is sparsely
distributed, where only a small fraction of tokens have high visual dependency
for visually-grounded reasoning; second, different trajectories exhibit
significant divergence in their overall visual dependency. Based on these
observations, we propose Visually-Perceptive Policy Optimization (VPPO), a
novel policy gradient algorithm that explicitly leverages token perception to
refine the learning signal. Specifically, VPPO achieves this through a dual
mechanism: it reweights a trajectory's advantage by its overall visual
dependency, and focuses policy updates exclusively on perceptually pivotal
tokens. On a comprehensive suite of eight perception and reasoning benchmarks,
VPPO demonstrates substantial gains over leading open-source RL-tuned models,
with its effectiveness consistently validated across 7B and 32B model scales.
Our findings not only establish a new token-level perceptual perspective for
analyzing multimodal RLVR but also present a novel and effective optimization
strategy to significantly enhance the multimodal reasoning capabilities of
LVLMs.

Result: 人类视觉注视轨迹遵循Levy行走模式，类似于动物觅食行为。CNN模型能够准确预测新图像的注视热点区域。

Conclusion: 人类视觉探索遵循与自然觅食类似的统计规律，为通过生成和预测框架建模注视行为开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Animals often forage via Levy walks stochastic trajectories with heavy tailed
step lengths optimized for sparse resource environments. We show that human
visual gaze follows similar dynamics when scanning images. While traditional
models emphasize image based saliency, the underlying spatiotemporal statistics
of eye movements remain underexplored. Understanding these dynamics has broad
applications in attention modeling and vision-based interfaces. In this study,
we conducted a large scale human subject experiment involving 40 participants
viewing 50 diverse images under unconstrained conditions, recording over 4
million gaze points using a high speed eye tracker. Analysis of these data
shows that the gaze trajectory of the human eye also follows a Levy walk akin
to animal foraging. This suggests that the human eye forages for visual
information in an optimally efficient manner. Further, we trained a
convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict fixation heatmaps from image
input alone. The model accurately reproduced salient fixation regions across
novel images, demonstrating that key components of gaze behavior are learnable
from visual structure alone. Our findings present new evidence that human
visual exploration obeys statistical laws analogous to natural foraging and
open avenues for modeling gaze through generative and predictive frameworks.

Abstract: Accurate and real-time radio map (RM) generation is crucial for
next-generation wireless systems, yet diffusion-based approaches often suffer
from large model sizes, slow iterative denoising, and high inference latency,
which hinder practical deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose
\textbf{RadioFlow}, a novel flow-matching-based generative framework that
achieves high-fidelity RM generation through single-step efficient sampling.
Unlike conventional diffusion models, RadioFlow learns continuous transport
trajectories between noise and data, enabling both training and inference to be
significantly accelerated while preserving reconstruction accuracy.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that RadioFlow achieves state-of-the-art
performance with \textbf{up to 8$\times$ fewer parameters} and \textbf{over
4$\times$ faster inference} compared to the leading diffusion-based baseline
(RadioDiff). This advancement provides a promising pathway toward scalable,
energy-efficient, and real-time electromagnetic digital twins for future 6G
networks. We release the code at

Motivation: 当前自监督单目深度估计方法由于语义-空间知识提取不足而面临性能限制，需要更好的上下文信息获取方式。

Method: 1) 从CLIP和DINO聚合多粒度特征，在对比语言指导下设计代理任务进行深度感知特征对齐；2) 在粗特征基础上整合相机姿态信息和像素级语言对齐来细化深度预测，可作为即插即用模块与现有MDE流程集成。

Conclusion: 通过语言指导聚合CLIP的语义上下文和DINO的空间细节，有效解决了特征粒度不匹配问题，提升了自监督单目深度估计性能。

Abstract: Current self-supervised monocular depth estimation (MDE) approaches encounter
performance limitations due to insufficient semantic-spatial knowledge
extraction. To address this challenge, we propose Hybrid-depth, a novel
framework that systematically integrates foundation models (e.g., CLIP and
DINO) to extract visual priors and acquire sufficient contextual information
for MDE. Our approach introduces a coarse-to-fine progressive learning
framework: 1) Firstly, we aggregate multi-grained features from CLIP (global
semantics) and DINO (local spatial details) under contrastive language
guidance. A proxy task comparing close-distant image patches is designed to
enforce depth-aware feature alignment using text prompts; 2) Next, building on
the coarse features, we integrate camera pose information and pixel-wise
language alignment to refine depth predictions. This module seamlessly
integrates with existing self-supervised MDE pipelines (e.g., Monodepth2,
ManyDepth) as a plug-and-play depth encoder, enhancing continuous depth
estimation. By aggregating CLIP's semantic context and DINO's spatial details
through language guidance, our method effectively addresses feature granularity
mismatches. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms SOTA methods across all metrics, which also
indeed benefits downstream tasks like BEV perception. Code is available at

Abstract: Nuclei instance segmentation in pathological images is crucial for downstream
tasks such as tumor microenvironment analysis. However, the high cost and
scarcity of annotated data limit the applicability of fully supervised methods,
while existing semi-supervised methods fail to adequately regularize
consistency at the instance level, lack leverage of the inherent prior
knowledge of pathological structures, and are prone to introducing noisy
pseudo-labels during training. In this paper, we propose an Instance-Aware
Robust Consistency Regularization Network (IRCR-Net) for accurate
instance-level nuclei segmentation. Specifically, we introduce the
Matching-Driven Instance-Aware Consistency (MIAC) and Prior-Driven
Instance-Aware Consistency (PIAC) mechanisms to refine the nuclei instance
segmentation result of the teacher and student subnetwork, particularly for
densely distributed and overlapping nuclei. We incorporate morphological prior
knowledge of nuclei in pathological images and utilize these priors to assess
the quality of pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled data. Low-quality
pseudo-labels are discarded, while high-quality predictions are enhanced to
reduce pseudo-label noise and benefit the network's robust training.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly
enhances semi-supervised nuclei instance segmentation performance across
multiple public datasets compared to existing approaches, even surpassing fully
supervised methods in some scenarios.

Abstract: We engage in the relatively underexplored task named thermal infrared image
enhancement. Existing infrared image enhancement methods primarily focus on
tackling individual degradations, such as noise, contrast, and blurring, making
it difficult to handle coupled degradations. Meanwhile, all-in-one enhancement
methods, commonly applied to RGB sensors, often demonstrate limited
effectiveness due to the significant differences in imaging models. In sight of
this, we first revisit the imaging mechanism and introduce a Progressive Prompt
Fusion Network (PPFN). Specifically, the PPFN initially establishes prompt
pairs based on the thermal imaging process. For each type of degradation, we
fuse the corresponding prompt pairs to modulate the model's features, providing
adaptive guidance that enables the model to better address specific
degradations under single or multiple conditions. In addition, a Selective
Progressive Training (SPT) mechanism is introduced to gradually refine the
model's handling of composite cases to align the enhancement process, which not
only allows the model to remove camera noise and retain key structural details,
but also enhancing the overall contrast of the thermal image. Furthermore, we
introduce the most high-quality, multi-scenarios infrared benchmark covering a
wide range of scenarios. Extensive experiments substantiate that our approach
not only delivers promising visual results under specific degradation but also
significantly improves performance on complex degradation scenes, achieving a
notable 8.76\% improvement. Code is available at

Abstract: Multi-modal keyphrase prediction (MMKP) aims to advance beyond text-only
methods by incorporating multiple modalities of input information to produce a
set of conclusive phrases. Traditional multi-modal approaches have been proven
to have significant limitations in handling the challenging absence and unseen
scenarios. Additionally, we identify shortcomings in existing benchmarks that
overestimate model capability due to significant overlap in training tests. In
this work, we propose leveraging vision-language models (VLMs) for the MMKP
task. Firstly, we use two widely-used strategies, e.g., zero-shot and
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to assess the lower bound performance of VLMs.
Next, to improve the complex reasoning capabilities of VLMs, we adopt
Fine-tune-CoT, which leverages high-quality CoT reasoning data generated by a
teacher model to finetune smaller models. Finally, to address the
"overthinking" phenomenon, we propose a dynamic CoT strategy which adaptively
injects CoT data during training, allowing the model to flexibly leverage its
reasoning capabilities during the inference stage. We evaluate the proposed
strategies on various datasets and the experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approaches. The code is available at

TL;DR: BLINK-Twice是一个视觉中心推理基准，专注于从纯视觉内容进行推理，超越了浅层感知，需要细粒度观察和分析推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理基准主要评估基于语言的推理，将视觉输入视为可替换的上下文。为了填补这一空白，需要开发一个基于挑战性感知任务的视觉中心推理基准。

Method: BLINK-Twice集成了三个核心组件：七种视觉挑战类型、自然对抗图像对（强制依赖视觉内容）以及标注的推理链（用于细粒度评估推理过程）。

Result: 评估了20个领先的MLLM模型，BLINK-Twice对当前模型构成了显著挑战。现有语言空间的推理策略（如思维链或自我批评）可以提升性能，但往往导致不稳定和冗余的推理。重复图像观察能提高模型性能，主动视觉交互（如o3模型）突显了视觉推理新范式的需求。

Conclusion: BLINK-Twice基准强调了从语言基础推理向图像基础推理的转变需求，揭示了当前MLLM在视觉推理方面的局限性，并指出了需要新的视觉推理范式。

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made rapid progress,
particularly in enhancing their reasoning capabilities. However, existing
reasoning benchmarks still primarily assess language-based reasoning, often
treating visual input as replaceable context. To address this gap, we introduce
BLINK-Twice, a vision-centric reasoning benchmark grounded in challenging
perceptual tasks. Instead of relying on external knowledge, our tasks require
models to reason from visual content alone, shifting the focus from
language-based to image-grounded reasoning. Compared to prior perception
benchmarks, it moves beyond shallow perception ("see") and requires
fine-grained observation and analytical reasoning ("observe"). BLINK-Twice
integrates three core components: seven types of visual challenges for testing
visual reasoning, natural adversarial image pairs that enforce reliance on
visual content, and annotated reasoning chains for fine-grained evaluation of
the reasoning process rather than final answers alone. We evaluate 20 leading
MLLMs, including 12 foundation models and 8 reasoning-enhanced models.
BLINK-Twice poses a significant challenge to current models. While existing
reasoning strategies in the language space-such as chain-of-thought or
self-criticism can improve performance, they often result in unstable and
redundant reasoning. We observe that repeated image observation improves
performance across models, and active visual interaction, as demonstrated by
models like o3, highlights the need for a new paradigm for vision reasoning.

TL;DR: VAD-GS是一个针对城市场景的3D高斯泼溅框架，通过体素化可见性推理、多样性感知视图选择和基于块匹配的多视图立体重建来恢复缺失的几何结构，解决了传统3DGS在点云初始化不完整时产生的失真和伪影问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D高斯泼溅方法严重依赖初始点云质量，在城市无边界动态环境中，由于观测视锥体重叠不足，导致点覆盖不均匀不完整，训练时会产生失真和伪影。现有致密化策略无法重建缺失结构。

Method: 1) 通过体素化可见性推理识别不可靠几何结构；2) 使用多样性感知视图选择信息丰富的支持视图；3) 通过基于块匹配的多视图立体重建恢复缺失结构；4) 在缺乏初始点的区域生成新的高斯基元。

Result: 在Waymo和nuScenes数据集上的大量实验表明，VAD-GS优于最先进的3DGS方法，显著提高了静态和动态对象重建几何的质量。

Conclusion: VAD-GS通过几何先验引导的新高斯基元生成，有效解决了3DGS在城市场景中的几何恢复挑战，为无边界动态环境提供了鲁棒的重建解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive performance in
synthesizing high-fidelity novel views. Nonetheless, its effectiveness
critically depends on the quality of the initialized point cloud. Specifically,
achieving uniform and complete point coverage over the underlying scene
structure requires overlapping observation frustums, an assumption that is
often violated in unbounded, dynamic urban environments. Training Gaussian
models with partially initialized point clouds often leads to distortions and
artifacts, as camera rays may fail to intersect valid surfaces, resulting in
incorrect gradient propagation to Gaussian primitives associated with occluded
or invisible geometry. Additionally, existing densification strategies simply
clone and split Gaussian primitives from existing ones, incapable of
reconstructing missing structures. To address these limitations, we propose
VAD-GS, a 3DGS framework tailored for geometry recovery in challenging urban
scenes. Our method identifies unreliable geometry structures via voxel-based
visibility reasoning, selects informative supporting views through
diversity-aware view selection, and recovers missing structures via patch
matching-based multi-view stereo reconstruction. This design enables the
generation of new Gaussian primitives guided by reliable geometric priors, even
in regions lacking initial points. Extensive experiments on the Waymo and
nuScenes datasets demonstrate that VAD-GS outperforms state-of-the-art 3DGS
approaches and significantly improves the quality of reconstructed geometry for
both static and dynamic objects. Source code will be released upon publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确量化森林生物量对碳循环监测至关重要，但直接从LiDAR点云估计木质体积和地上生物量具有挑战性，因为难以建模长程依赖关系来区分树木。

Method: 将Mamba模型的选择性状态空间模型集成到Minkowski网络中，有效编码全局上下文和长程依赖关系，结合跳跃连接增强特征并加速收敛。

Result: 在丹麦国家森林清单LiDAR数据上评估，Minkowski-MambaNet显著优于最先进方法，提供更准确和稳健的估计。

Conclusion: 该工作为大规模森林生物量分析提供了强大工具，推进了基于LiDAR的森林清查技术。

Abstract: Accurate forest biomass quantification is vital for carbon cycle monitoring.
While airborne LiDAR excels at capturing 3D forest structure, directly
estimating woody volume and Aboveground Biomass (AGB) from point clouds is
challenging due to difficulties in modeling long-range dependencies needed to
distinguish trees.We propose Minkowski-MambaNet, a novel deep learning
framework that directly estimates volume and AGB from raw LiDAR. Its key
innovation is integrating the Mamba model's Selective State Space Model (SSM)
into a Minkowski network, enabling effective encoding of global context and
long-range dependencies for improved tree differentiation. Skip connections are
incorporated to enhance features and accelerate convergence.Evaluated on Danish
National Forest Inventory LiDAR data, Minkowski-MambaNet significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing more accurate and robust
estimates. Crucially, it requires no Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and is robust
to boundary artifacts. This work offers a powerful tool for large-scale forest
biomass analysis, advancing LiDAR-based forest inventories.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了两种无需重新训练即可利用DETR中MLP层固有稀疏性的方法：静态指示器稀疏化(SIBS)和微门控稀疏化(MGS)，其中MGS通过轻量级门控机制实现85-95%的激活稀疏度，在COCO数据集上保持或提升性能的同时显著减少计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于Transformer的模型在视觉任务（如目标检测）中的推理效率仍然是一个挑战，特别是在DETR的MLP层中存在固有的稀疏性，需要开发方法来利用这种稀疏性而不需要重新训练整个模型。

Method: 1. SIBS：基于固定激活模式的启发式方法，预测神经元不活跃性；2. MGS：在预训练DETR上训练的轻量级门控机制，使用小型线性层预测动态稀疏性。

Result: MGS实现了85-95%的激活稀疏度，在COCO数据集上的实验表明，该方法在保持甚至提高性能的同时显著减少了计算量。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种实用、输入自适应的稀疏化方法，使得无需完整模型重新训练即可高效部署预训练的视觉Transformer模型。

Abstract: Efficient inference with transformer-based models remains a challenge,
especially in vision tasks like object detection. We analyze the inherent
sparsity in the MLP layers of DETR and introduce two methods to exploit it
without retraining. First, we propose Static Indicator-Based Sparsification
(SIBS), a heuristic method that predicts neuron inactivity based on fixed
activation patterns. While simple, SIBS offers limited gains due to the
input-dependent nature of sparsity. To address this, we introduce Micro-Gated
Sparsification (MGS), a lightweight gating mechanism trained on top of a
pretrained DETR. MGS predicts dynamic sparsity using a small linear layer and
achieves up to 85 to 95% activation sparsity. Experiments on the COCO dataset
show that MGS maintains or even improves performance while significantly
reducing computation. Our method offers a practical, input-adaptive approach to
sparsification, enabling efficient deployment of pretrained vision transformers
without full model retraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从单目视频重建的4D场景基于文本提示进行编辑在内容创作和虚拟环境中具有广泛应用价值，但面临在复杂动态场景中实现语义精确局部编辑同时保持未编辑内容完整性的挑战。

Method: 使用量化CLIP特征增强3D高斯形成语言嵌入动态表示；提出两阶段点级定位策略：先通过CLIP相似度选择候选高斯，再精化其空间范围；使用基于扩散的视频编辑模型进行目标编辑，通过流和涂鸦引导确保空间保真度和时间一致性。

Result: 大量实验表明，Mono4DEditor能够在多样场景和对象类型上实现高质量的文本驱动编辑，同时保持未编辑区域的外观和几何特性，在灵活性和视觉保真度方面超越先前方法。

Conclusion: Mono4DEditor框架成功解决了4D场景编辑中的语义精确性和局部化挑战，为文本驱动的动态场景编辑提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Editing 4D scenes reconstructed from monocular videos based on text prompts
is a valuable yet challenging task with broad applications in content creation
and virtual environments. The key difficulty lies in achieving semantically
precise edits in localized regions of complex, dynamic scenes, while preserving
the integrity of unedited content. To address this, we introduce Mono4DEditor,
a novel framework for flexible and accurate text-driven 4D scene editing. Our
method augments 3D Gaussians with quantized CLIP features to form a
language-embedded dynamic representation, enabling efficient semantic querying
of arbitrary spatial regions. We further propose a two-stage point-level
localization strategy that first selects candidate Gaussians via CLIP
similarity and then refines their spatial extent to improve accuracy. Finally,
targeted edits are performed on localized regions using a diffusion-based video
editing model, with flow and scribble guidance ensuring spatial fidelity and
temporal coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mono4DEditor enables
high-quality, text-driven edits across diverse scenes and object types, while
preserving the appearance and geometry of unedited areas and surpassing prior
approaches in both flexibility and visual fidelity.

Motivation: 现有基于学习的方法在处理真实低光场景中的严重噪声时仍存在困难，主要原因是无法有效利用时间信息。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：第一阶段使用视觉状态空间块进行多帧对齐，恢复亮度、颜色和结构；第二阶段引入基于动态权重的时间聚合循环细化模块，通过光流指导自适应平衡静态和动态区域。

Result: 在真实低光视频上的实验表明，DWTA-Net能有效抑制噪声和伪影，相比最先进方法提供更优越的视觉质量。

Conclusion: DWTA-Net通过联合利用短期和长期时间线索，成功解决了低光视频增强中的噪声问题，为真实低光场景提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Low-light video enhancement (LLVE) is challenging due to noise, low contrast,
and color degradations. Learning-based approaches offer fast inference but
still struggle with heavy noise in real low-light scenes, primarily due to
limitations in effectively leveraging temporal information. In this paper, we
address this issue with DWTA-Net, a novel two-stage framework that jointly
exploits short- and long-term temporal cues. Stage I employs Visual State-Space
blocks for multi-frame alignment, recovering brightness, color, and structure
with local consistency. Stage II introduces a recurrent refinement module with
dynamic weight-based temporal aggregation guided by optical flow, adaptively
balancing static and dynamic regions. A texture-adaptive loss further preserves
fine details while promoting smoothness in flat areas. Experiments on
real-world low-light videos show that DWTA-Net effectively suppresses noise and
artifacts, delivering superior visual quality compared with state-of-the-art
methods.

Motivation: 对比视觉语言模型存在由跨模态单一主导特征维度引起的模态差距，这些主导维度具有高预测敏感性，限制其影响可以改善校准误差

Method: 维度熵最大化，通过正则化文本特征分布使其趋向均匀分布，减少对主导维度的依赖

Result: 缓解了测试时提示调优中校准性能的退化，提高了视觉语言模型在真实部署场景中的可靠性

Conclusion: 该方法为增强视觉语言模型可靠性提供了一个简单而有效的解决方案

Abstract: Test-time adaptation paradigm provides flexibility towards domain shifts by
performing immediate adaptation on unlabeled target data from the source model.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) leverage their generalization capabilities for
diverse downstream tasks, and test-time prompt tuning has emerged as a
prominent solution for adapting VLMs. In this work, we explore contrastive VLMs
and identify the modality gap caused by a single dominant feature dimension
across modalities. We observe that the dominant dimensions in both text and
image modalities exhibit high predictive sensitivity, and that constraining
their influence can improve calibration error. Building on this insight, we
propose dimensional entropy maximization that regularizes the distribution of
textual features toward uniformity to mitigate the dependency of dominant
dimensions. Our method alleviates the degradation of calibration performance in
test-time prompt tuning, offering a simple yet effective solution to enhance
the reliability of VLMs in real-world deployment scenarios.

Conclusion: 该方法在少样本条件下有效生成无限新角色并保持风格一致性，展示了在动画、游戏等领域的应用潜力。

Abstract: The audiovisual industry is undergoing a profound transformation as it is
integrating AI developments not only to automate routine tasks but also to
inspire new forms of art. This paper addresses the problem of producing a
virtually unlimited number of novel characters that preserve the artistic style
and shared visual traits of a small set of human-designed reference characters,
thus broadening creative possibilities in animation, gaming, and related
domains. Our solution builds upon DreamBooth, a well-established fine-tuning
technique for text-to-image diffusion models, and adapts it to tackle two core
challenges: capturing intricate character details beyond textual prompts and
the few-shot nature of the training data. To achieve this, we propose a
multi-token strategy, using clustering to assign separate tokens to individual
characters and their collective style, combined with LoRA-based
parameter-efficient fine-tuning. By removing the class-specific regularization
set and introducing random tokens and embeddings during generation, our
approach allows for unlimited character creation while preserving the learned
style. We evaluate our method on five small specialized datasets, comparing it
to relevant baselines using both quantitative metrics and a human evaluation
study. Our results demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality, diverse
characters while preserving the distinctive aesthetic features of the reference
characters, with human evaluation further reinforcing its effectiveness and
highlighting the potential of our method.

Motivation: 研究三星智能手机图像中的对角线伪影对PRNU相机源验证的影响，以及这些伪影在法证应用中的潜在价值。

Method: 分析多个三星手机型号的图像，比较普通图像和RAW图像中的伪影情况，研究伪影对PRNU指纹验证的影响。

Result: 发现某些Galaxy S和A系列机型存在共同的伪影模式，导致指纹碰撞；RAW图像可绕过引入伪影的处理流程，实现可靠验证；伪影可用于减少HDR图像误检和定位人像模式中的合成虚化区域。

Conclusion: 对角线伪影会影响PRNU验证，但通过RAW图像仍可实现可靠验证；这些伪影在法证应用中具有实用价值，可用于图像分析和区域定位。

Abstract: We investigate diagonal artifacts present in images captured by several
Samsung smartphones and their impact on PRNU-based camera source verification.
We first show that certain Galaxy S series models share a common pattern
causing fingerprint collisions, with a similar issue also found in some Galaxy
A models. Next, we demonstrate that reliable PRNU verification remains feasible
for devices supporting PRO mode with raw capture, since raw images bypass the
processing pipeline that introduces artifacts. This option, however, is not
available for the mid-range A series models or in forensic cases without access
to raw images. Finally, we outline potential forensic applications of the
diagonal artifacts, such as reducing misdetections in HDR images and localizing
regions affected by synthetic bokeh in portrait-mode images.

Motivation: 解决航拍图像中小目标检测因像素表示有限导致特征提取过程中信息严重退化的问题，现有FPN方法通过后处理增强但重建细节往往偏离原始图像信息。

Method: 提出PRNet框架，包含两个模块：渐进式精化颈部（PRN）通过骨干网络重用和迭代精化实现空间-语义对齐；增强切片采样（ESSamp）通过优化的重排和卷积在下采样过程中保留浅层信息。

Conclusion: PRNet通过优先保留和有效利用原始浅层空间特征，成功提升了小目标检测性能，实现了优越的精度-效率权衡。

Abstract: Small object detection in aerial images suffers from severe information
degradation during feature extraction due to limited pixel representations,
where shallow spatial details fail to align effectively with semantic
information, leading to frequent misses and false positives. Existing FPN-based
methods attempt to mitigate these losses through post-processing enhancements,
but the reconstructed details often deviate from the original image
information, impeding their fusion with semantic content. To address this
limitation, we propose PRNet, a real-time detection framework that prioritizes
the preservation and efficient utilization of primitive shallow spatial
features to enhance small object representations. PRNet achieves this via two
modules:the Progressive Refinement Neck (PRN) for spatial-semantic alignment
through backbone reuse and iterative refinement, and the Enhanced SliceSamp
(ESSamp) for preserving shallow information during downsampling via optimized
rearrangement and convolution. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone, AI-TOD,
and UAVDT datasets demonstrate that PRNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods
under comparable computational constraints, achieving superior
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.

Result: 在面部变形、图像变形和高斯泼溅变形等应用中，FLOWING实现了最先进的变形质量，且收敛更快。

Conclusion: 基于流的方法能够产生原理性且稳定的变换，实现准确且结构保持的变形。

Abstract: Morphing is a long-standing problem in vision and computer graphics,
requiring a time-dependent warping for feature alignment and a blending for
smooth interpolation. Recently, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) have been
explored as implicit neural representations (INRs) for modeling such
deformations, due to their meshlessness and differentiability; however,
extracting coherent and accurate morphings from standard MLPs typically relies
on costly regularizations, which often lead to unstable training and prevent
effective feature alignment. To overcome these limitations, we propose FLOWING
(FLOW morphING), a framework that recasts warping as the construction of a
differential vector flow, naturally ensuring continuity, invertibility, and
temporal coherence by encoding structural flow properties directly into the
network architectures. This flow-centric approach yields principled and stable
transformations, enabling accurate and structure-preserving morphing of both 2D
images and 3D shapes. Extensive experiments across a range of applications -
including face and image morphing, as well as Gaussian Splatting morphing -
show that FLOWING achieves state-of-the-art morphing quality with faster
convergence. Code and pretrained models are available at

TL;DR: TC-LoRA是一种新的可控扩散模型范式，通过超网络实时生成LoRA适配器，在扩散过程的每个步骤中动态调整模型权重，实现上下文感知的控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的可控扩散模型使用静态条件策略来处理动态的多阶段去噪过程，限制了模型在生成过程中从粗结构到精细细节的适应能力。

Method: 使用超网络基于时间和用户条件为冻结的主干网络在每个扩散步骤生成LoRA适配器，实现动态的权重修改。

Result: 在各种数据域上的实验表明，这种动态参数化控制相比静态激活方法显著提高了生成保真度和空间条件的遵循度。

Conclusion: TC-LoRA建立了一种替代方法，通过更深层次的权重功能适应来修改模型的调节策略，使控制能够与任务和生成阶段的动态需求保持一致。

Abstract: Current controllable diffusion models typically rely on fixed architectures
that modify intermediate activations to inject guidance conditioned on a new
modality. This approach uses a static conditioning strategy for a dynamic,
multi-stage denoising process, limiting the model's ability to adapt its
response as the generation evolves from coarse structure to fine detail. We
introduce TC-LoRA (Temporally Modulated Conditional LoRA), a new paradigm that
enables dynamic, context-aware control by conditioning the model's weights
directly. Our framework uses a hypernetwork to generate LoRA adapters
on-the-fly, tailoring weight modifications for the frozen backbone at each
diffusion step based on time and the user's condition. This mechanism enables
the model to learn and execute an explicit, adaptive strategy for applying
conditional guidance throughout the entire generation process. Through
experiments on various data domains, we demonstrate that this dynamic,
parametric control significantly enhances generative fidelity and adherence to
spatial conditions compared to static, activation-based methods. TC-LoRA
establishes an alternative approach in which the model's conditioning strategy
is modified through a deeper functional adaptation of its weights, allowing
control to align with the dynamic demands of the task and generative stage.

Motivation: 生物医学目标检测面临标注数据稀缺和新类别频繁出现的挑战，现有方法通常孤立处理这些任务，缺乏统一的解决方案。

Method: 基于类别无关的DETR骨干网络，通过原始支持图像构建类别原型，使用增强视图和轻量级Transformer解码器学习嵌入空间，联合优化原型匹配损失、对齐分离损失和KL散度正则化。

Conclusion: FSP-DETR提供了推理时灵活性，支持未见类别识别、背景拒绝和跨任务适应而无需重新训练，为生物医学目标检测提供了统一解决方案。

Abstract: Object detection in biomedical settings is fundamentally constrained by the
scarcity of labeled data and the frequent emergence of novel or rare
categories. We present FSP-DETR, a unified detection framework that enables
robust few-shot detection, open-set recognition, and generalization to unseen
biomedical tasks within a single model. Built upon a class-agnostic DETR
backbone, our approach constructs class prototypes from original support images
and learns an embedding space using augmented views and a lightweight
transformer decoder. Training jointly optimizes a prototype matching loss, an
alignment-based separation loss, and a KL divergence regularization to improve
discriminative feature learning and calibration under scarce supervision.
Unlike prior work that tackles these tasks in isolation, FSP-DETR enables
inference-time flexibility to support unseen class recognition, background
rejection, and cross-task adaptation without retraining. We also introduce a
new ova species detection benchmark with 20 parasite classes and establish
standardized evaluation protocols. Extensive experiments across ova, blood
cell, and malaria detection tasks demonstrate that FSP-DETR significantly
outperforms prior few-shot and prototype-based detectors, especially in
low-shot and open-set scenarios.

TL;DR: 对2023-2025年CVPR、ICLR和NeurIPS会议的26,104篇论文进行透明、可重复的研究趋势测量，识别出三个宏观转变：多模态视觉语言-LLM研究的急剧增长、生成方法的稳步扩展、以及3D和视频活动的持续活跃。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了量化计算机视觉和机器学习领域的研究趋势，特别是多模态、生成方法和3D/视频等方向的发展变化，提供可审计和扩展的分析方法。

Method: 对论文标题和摘要进行标准化、短语保护和匹配，使用手工制作的词典分配最多35个主题标签，挖掘任务、架构、训练机制、目标、数据集和共现模态的细粒度线索。

Result: 识别出三个主要趋势：1) 多模态视觉语言-LLM工作急剧增长，将经典感知重新构建为指令跟随和多步推理；2) 生成方法稳步扩展，扩散研究围绕可控性、蒸馏和速度进行整合；3) 3D和视频活动持续活跃，从NeRFs转向高斯溅射，并越来越关注以人和智能体为中心的理解。

Abstract: We present a transparent, reproducible measurement of research trends across
26,104 accepted papers from CVPR, ICLR, and NeurIPS spanning 2023-2025. Titles
and abstracts are normalized, phrase-protected, and matched against a
hand-crafted lexicon to assign up to 35 topical labels and mine fine-grained
cues about tasks, architectures, training regimes, objectives, datasets, and
co-mentioned modalities. The analysis quantifies three macro shifts: (1) a
sharp rise of multimodal vision-language-LLM work, which increasingly reframes
classic perception as instruction following and multi-step reasoning; (2)
steady expansion of generative methods, with diffusion research consolidating
around controllability, distillation, and speed; and (3) resilient 3D and video
activity, with composition moving from NeRFs to Gaussian splatting and a
growing emphasis on human- and agent-centric understanding. Within VLMs,
parameter-efficient adaptation like prompting/adapters/LoRA and lightweight
vision-language bridges dominate; training practice shifts from building
encoders from scratch to instruction tuning and finetuning strong backbones;
contrastive objectives recede relative to cross-entropy/ranking and
distillation. Cross-venue comparisons show CVPR has a stronger 3D footprint and
ICLR the highest VLM share, while reliability themes such as efficiency or
robustness diffuse across areas. We release the lexicon and methodology to
enable auditing and extension. Limitations include lexicon recall and
abstract-only scope, but the longitudinal signals are consistent across venues
and years.

Abstract: With the current surge in spatial reasoning explorations, researchers have
made significant progress in understanding indoor scenes, but still struggle
with diverse applications such as robotics and autonomous driving. This paper
aims to advance all-scale spatial reasoning across diverse scenarios by
tackling two key challenges: 1) the heavy reliance on indoor 3D scans and
labor-intensive manual annotations for dataset curation; 2) the absence of
effective all-scale scene modeling, which often leads to overfitting to
individual scenes. In this paper, we introduce a holistic solution that
integrates a structured spatial reasoning knowledge system, scale-aware
modeling, and a progressive training paradigm, as the first attempt to broaden
the all-scale spatial intelligence of MLLMs to the best of our knowledge. Using
a task-specific, specialist-driven automated pipeline, we curate over 38K video
scenes across 5 spatial scales to create SpaceVista-1M, a dataset comprising
approximately 1M spatial QA pairs spanning 19 diverse task types. While
specialist models can inject useful domain knowledge, they are not reliable for
evaluation. We then build an all-scale benchmark with precise annotations by
manually recording, retrieving, and assembling video-based data. However, naive
training with SpaceVista-1M often yields suboptimal results due to the
potential knowledge conflict. Accordingly, we introduce SpaceVista-7B, a
spatial reasoning model that accepts dense inputs beyond semantics and uses
scale as an anchor for scale-aware experts and progressive rewards. Finally,
extensive evaluations across 5 benchmarks, including our SpaceVista-Bench,
demonstrate competitive performance, showcasing strong generalization across
all scales and scenarios. Our dataset, model, and benchmark will be released on
https://peiwensun2000.github.io/mm2km .

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于蒸馏的框架，通过从预训练的小型动作模型转移知识，为视觉语言模型赋予动作执行能力，显著降低训练成本并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言动作模型虽然能提升机器人操作的泛化能力，但从头训练成本高昂，需要更高效的训练方法。

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：先通过轻量级对齐将VLM隐藏状态映射到小型动作模型的动作空间，再利用其预训练动作解码器；然后选择性微调语言模型、状态编码器和动作模块。

Result: 在LIBERO数据集上达到97.3%平均成功率（提升11.8%），在LIBERO-LONG上达到93.5%（提升24.5%），真实世界实验中达到82.0%成功率（提升17%）。

Conclusion: 动作蒸馏能有效让VLM生成精确动作，同时大幅降低训练成本，在多个基准测试中超越现有方法。

Abstract: Vision-Language Action (VLA) models significantly advance robotic
manipulation by leveraging the strong perception capabilities of pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs). By integrating action modules into these
pretrained models, VLA methods exhibit improved generalization. However,
training them from scratch is costly. In this work, we propose a simple yet
effective distillation-based framework that equips VLMs with action-execution
capability by transferring knowledge from pretrained small action models. Our
architecture retains the original VLM structure, adding only an action token
and a state encoder to incorporate physical inputs. To distill action
knowledge, we adopt a two-stage training strategy. First, we perform
lightweight alignment by mapping VLM hidden states into the action space of the
small action model, enabling effective reuse of its pretrained action decoder
and avoiding expensive pretraining. Second, we selectively fine-tune the
language model, state encoder, and action modules, enabling the system to
integrate multimodal inputs with precise action generation. Specifically, the
action token provides the VLM with a direct handle for predicting future
actions, while the state encoder allows the model to incorporate robot dynamics
not captured by vision alone. This design yields substantial efficiency gains
over training large VLA models from scratch. Compared with previous
state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves 97.3% average success rate on
LIBERO (11.8% improvement) and 93.5% on LIBERO-LONG (24.5% improvement). In
real-world experiments across five manipulation tasks, our method consistently
outperforms the teacher model, achieving 82.0% success rate (17% improvement),
which demonstrate that action distillation effectively enables VLMs to generate
precise actions while substantially reducing training costs.

TL;DR: 提出ConPoSe方法，结合大语言模型的推理能力和局部搜索来选择多机器人协作推运物体时的接触点，解决组合爆炸问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在杂乱环境中进行多机器人协作物体运输时，接触点选择方案随机器人数量和物体尺寸呈组合增长，限制了可扩展性。

Method: 结合大语言模型的常识推理能力和局部搜索算法来选择机器人-物体接触点。

Result: ConPoSe方法成功为长方体、圆柱体和T形等多种形状选择接触点，在机器人数量和物体尺寸扩展性方面优于解析方法和纯LLM方法。

Conclusion: LLM引导的局部搜索方法能有效解决多机器人协作推运中的接触点选择问题，具有良好的可扩展性。

Abstract: Object transportation in cluttered environments is a fundamental task in
various domains, including domestic service and warehouse logistics. In
cooperative object transport, multiple robots must coordinate to move objects
that are too large for a single robot. One transport strategy is pushing, which
only requires simple robots. However, careful selection of robot-object contact
points is necessary to push the object along a preplanned path. Although this
selection can be solved analytically, the solution space grows combinatorially
with the number of robots and object size, limiting scalability. Inspired by
how humans rely on common-sense reasoning for cooperative transport, we propose
combining the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models with local search
to select suitable contact points. Our LLM-guided local search method for
contact point selection, ConPoSe, successfully selects contact points for a
variety of shapes, including cuboids, cylinders, and T-shapes. We demonstrate
that ConPoSe scales better with the number of robots and object size than the
analytical approach, and also outperforms pure LLM-based selection.

Conclusion: Point and Go模式切换方法通过更直观的控制参考系设计，有效提升了轮椅安装机械臂的操作性能和用户体验。

Abstract: Operating high degree of freedom robots can be difficult for users of
wheelchair mounted robotic manipulators. Mode switching in Cartesian space has
several drawbacks such as unintuitive control reference frames, separate
translation and orientation control, and limited movement capabilities that
hinder performance. We propose Point and Go mode switching, which reallocates
the Cartesian mode switching reference frames into a more intuitive action
space comprised of new translation and rotation modes. We use a novel sweeping
motion to point the gripper, which defines the new translation axis along the
robot base frame's horizontal plane. This creates an intuitive `point and go'
translation mode that allows the user to easily perform complex, human-like
movements without switching control modes. The system's rotation mode combines
position control with a refined end-effector oriented frame that provides
precise and consistent robot actions in various end-effector poses. We verified
its effectiveness through initial experiments, followed by a three-task user
study that compared our method to Cartesian mode switching and a state of the
art learning method. Results show that Point and Go mode switching reduced
completion times by 31\%, pauses by 41\%, and mode switches by 33\%, while
receiving significantly favorable responses in user surveys.

Abstract: Developing table tennis robots that mirror human speed, accuracy, and ability
to predict and respond to the full range of ball spins remains a significant
challenge for legged robots. To demonstrate these capabilities we present a
system to play dynamic table tennis for quadrupedal robots that integrates high
speed perception, trajectory prediction, and agile control. Our system uses
external cameras for high-speed ball localization, physical models with learned
residuals to infer spin and predict trajectories, and a novel model predictive
control (MPC) formulation for agile full-body control. Notably, a continuous
set of stroke strategies emerge automatically from different ball return
objectives using this control paradigm. We demonstrate our system in the real
world on a Spot quadruped, evaluate accuracy of each system component, and
exhibit coordination through the system's ability to aim and return balls with
varying spin types. As a further demonstration, the system is able to rally
with human players.

Conclusion: GPI作为生成式机器人模仿学习方法的替代方案，具有高效、可解释和可扩展的优势

Abstract: We propose a Geometry-aware Policy Imitation (GPI) approach that rethinks
imitation learning by treating demonstrations as geometric curves rather than
collections of state-action samples. From these curves, GPI derives distance
fields that give rise to two complementary control primitives: a progression
flow that advances along expert trajectories and an attraction flow that
corrects deviations. Their combination defines a controllable, non-parametric
vector field that directly guides robot behavior. This formulation decouples
metric learning from policy synthesis, enabling modular adaptation across
low-dimensional robot states and high-dimensional perceptual inputs. GPI
naturally supports multimodality by preserving distinct demonstrations as
separate models and allows efficient composition of new demonstrations through
simple additions to the distance field. We evaluate GPI in simulation and on
real robots across diverse tasks. Experiments show that GPI achieves higher
success rates than diffusion-based policies while running 20 times faster,
requiring less memory, and remaining robust to perturbations. These results
establish GPI as an efficient, interpretable, and scalable alternative to
generative approaches for robotic imitation learning. Project website:

Abstract: From loco-motion to dextrous manipulation, humanoid robots have made
remarkable strides in demonstrating complex full-body capabilities. However,
the majority of current robot learning datasets and benchmarks mainly focus on
stationary robot arms, and the few existing humanoid datasets are either
confined to fixed environments or limited in task diversity, often lacking
human-humanoid interaction and lower-body locomotion. Moreover, there are a few
standardized evaluation platforms for benchmarking learning-based policies on
humanoid data. In this work, we present Humanoid Everyday, a large-scale and
diverse humanoid manipulation dataset characterized by extensive task variety
involving dextrous object manipulation, human-humanoid interaction,
locomotion-integrated actions, and more. Leveraging a highly efficient
human-supervised teleoperation pipeline, Humanoid Everyday aggregates
high-quality multimodal sensory data, including RGB, depth, LiDAR, and tactile
inputs, together with natural language annotations, comprising 10.3k
trajectories and over 3 million frames of data across 260 tasks across 7 broad
categories. In addition, we conduct an analysis of representative policy
learning methods on our dataset, providing insights into their strengths and
limitations across different task categories. For standardized evaluation, we
introduce a cloud-based evaluation platform that allows researchers to
seamlessly deploy their policies in our controlled setting and receive
performance feedback. By releasing Humanoid Everyday along with our policy
learning analysis and a standardized cloud-based evaluation platform, we intend
to advance research in general-purpose humanoid manipulation and lay the
groundwork for more capable and embodied robotic agents in real-world
scenarios. Our dataset, data collection code, and cloud evaluation website are
made publicly available on our project website.

Conclusion: 该框架通过直接利用物理接触信息推断人类意图，实现了可靠的人机协作运动规划，减少了硬件成本并提高了系统的实时性和适应性

Abstract: Human-robot collaboration (HRC) requires robots to adapt their motions to
human intent to ensure safe and efficient cooperation in shared spaces.
Although large language models (LLMs) provide high-level reasoning for
inferring human intent, their application to reliable motion planning in HRC
remains challenging. Physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) is intuitive but
often relies on continuous kinesthetic guidance, which imposes burdens on
operators. To address these challenges, a contact-informed adaptive
motion-planning framework is introduced to infer human intent directly from
physical contact and employ the inferred intent for online motion correction in
HRC. First, an optimization-based force estimation method is proposed to infer
human-intended contact forces and locations from joint torque measurements and
a robot dynamics model, thereby reducing cost and installation complexity while
enabling whole-body sensitivity. Then, a torque-based contact detection
mechanism with link-level localization is introduced to reduce the optimization
search space and to enable real-time estimation. Subsequently, a
contact-informed adaptive motion planner is developed to infer human intent
from contacts and to replan robot motion online, while maintaining smoothness
and adapting to human corrections. Finally, experiments on a 7-DOF manipulator
are conducted to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed force estimation
method and the effectiveness of the contact-informed adaptive motion planner
under perception uncertainty in HRC.

Abstract: Deep space missions face extreme communication delays and environmental
uncertainty that prevent real-time ground operations. To support autonomous
science operations in communication-constrained environments, we present a
partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) framework that adaptively
sequences spacecraft science instruments. We integrate a Bayesian network into
the POMDP observation space to manage the high-dimensional and uncertain
measurements typical of astrobiology missions. This network compactly encodes
dependencies among measurements and improves the interpretability and
computational tractability of science data. Instrument operation policies are
computed offline, allowing resource-aware plans to be generated and thoroughly
validated prior to launch. We use the Enceladus Orbilander's proposed Life
Detection Suite (LDS) as a case study, demonstrating how Bayesian network
structure and reward shaping influence system performance. We compare our
method against the mission's baseline Concept of Operations (ConOps),
evaluating both misclassification rates and performance in off-nominal sample
accumulation scenarios. Our approach reduces sample identification errors by
nearly 40%

Conclusion: CDE方法能够有效利用视觉语言模型的先验知识来改进视觉强化学习的探索效率，并在真实世界任务中表现出良好的迁移能力。

Abstract: Intelligent exploration remains a critical challenge in reinforcement
learning (RL), especially in visual control tasks. Unlike low-dimensional
state-based RL, visual RL must extract task-relevant structure from raw pixels,
making exploration inefficient. We propose Concept-Driven Exploration (CDE),
which leverages a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) to generate
object-centric visual concepts from textual task descriptions as weak,
potentially noisy supervisory signals. Rather than directly conditioning on
these noisy signals, CDE trains a policy to reconstruct the concepts via an
auxiliary objective, using reconstruction accuracy as an intrinsic reward to
guide exploration toward task-relevant objects. Because the policy internalizes
these concepts, VLM queries are only needed during training, reducing
dependence on external models during deployment. Across five challenging
simulated visual manipulation tasks, CDE achieves efficient, targeted
exploration and remains robust to noisy VLM predictions. Finally, we
demonstrate real-world transfer by deploying CDE on a Franka Research 3 arm,
attaining an 80\% success rate in a real-world manipulation task.

Abstract: Accurate calibration of intrinsic (odometer scaling factors) and extrinsic
parameters (IMU-odometer translation and rotation) is essential for autonomous
ground vehicle localization. Existing GNSS-aided approaches often rely on
positioning results or raw measurements without ambiguity resolution, and their
observability properties remain underexplored. This paper proposes a tightly
coupled online calibration method that fuses IMU, odometer, and raw GNSS
measurements (pseudo-range, carrier-phase, and Doppler) within an extendable
factor graph optimization (FGO) framework, incorporating outlier mitigation and
ambiguity resolution. Observability analysis reveals that two horizontal
translation and three rotation parameters are observable under general motion,
while vertical translation remains unobservable. Simulation and real-world
experiments demonstrate superior calibration and localization performance over
state-of-the-art loosely coupled methods. Specifically, the IMU-odometer
positioning using our calibrated parameters achieves the absolute maximum error
of 17.75 m while the one of LC method is 61.51 m, achieving up to 71.14 percent
improvement. To foster further research, we also release the first open-source
dataset that combines IMU, 2D odometer, and raw GNSS measurements from both
rover and base stations.

Abstract: In-Hand Manipulation, as many other dexterous tasks, remains a difficult
challenge in robotics by combining complex dynamic systems with the capability
to control and manoeuvre various objects using its actuators. This work
presents the application of a previously developed hybrid Reinforcement
Learning (RL) Framework to In-Hand Manipulation task, verifying that it is
capable of improving the performance of the task. The model combines concepts
of both Model-Free and Model-Based Reinforcement Learning, by guiding a trained
policy with the help of a dynamic model and value-function through trajectory
evaluation, as done in Model Predictive Control. This work evaluates the
performance of the model by comparing it with the policy that will be guided.
To fully explore this, various tests are performed using both fully-actuated
and under-actuated simulated robotic hands to manipulate different objects for
a given task. The performance of the model will also be tested for
generalization tests, by changing the properties of the objects in which both
the policy and dynamic model were trained, such as density and size, and
additionally by guiding a trained policy in a certain object to perform the
same task in a different one. The results of this work show that, given a
policy with high average reward and an accurate dynamic model, the hybrid
framework improves the performance of in-hand manipulation tasks for most test
cases, even when the object properties are changed. However, this improvement
comes at the expense of increasing the computational cost, due to the

Abstract: Soft robots offer significant advantages in safety and adaptability, yet
achieving precise and dynamic control remains a major challenge due to their
inherently complex and nonlinear dynamics. Recently, Data-enabled Predictive
Control (DeePC) has emerged as a promising model-free approach that bypasses
explicit system identification by directly leveraging input-output data. While
DeePC has shown success in other domains, its application to soft robots
remains underexplored, particularly for three-dimensional (3D) soft robotic
systems. This paper addresses this gap by developing and experimentally
validating an effective DeePC framework on a 3D, cable-driven soft arm.
Specifically, we design and fabricate a soft robotic arm with a thick tubing
backbone for stability, a dense silicone body with large cavities for strength
and flexibility, and rigid endcaps for secure termination. Using this platform,
we implement DeePC with singular value decomposition (SVD)-based dimension
reduction for two key control tasks: fixed-point regulation and trajectory
tracking in 3D space. Comparative experiments with a baseline model-based
controller demonstrate DeePC's superior accuracy, robustness, and adaptability,
highlighting its potential as a practical solution for dynamic control of soft
robots.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决三维空间中点到轴对称二次曲面的邻近问题，现有文献中缺乏将R^3问题简化为R^2的有效方法，需要开发更高效的计算方法。

Method: 将R^3空间的邻近问题简化为R^2空间，基于圆锥曲线的几何特性（如次法线、半长轴长度、离心率、斜率和半径）开发新算法，对抛物线和椭圆/双曲线分别进行2-3种子情况分类。

Conclusion: 通过将三维问题简化为二维，并基于几何特性开发分类算法，成功实现了高效的点到轴对称二次曲面邻近计算，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents the classification of a general quadric into an
axisymmetric quadric (AQ) and the solution to the problem of the proximity of a
given point to an AQ. The problem of proximity in $R^3$ is reduced to the same
in $R^2$, which is not found in the literature. A new method to solve the
problem in $R^2$ is used based on the geometrical properties of the conics,
such as sub-normal, length of the semi-major axis, eccentricity, slope and
radius. Furthermore, the problem in $R^2$ is categorised into two and three
more sub-cases for parabola and ellipse/hyperbola, respectively, depending on
the location of the point, which is a novel approach as per the authors'
knowledge. The proposed method is suitable for implementation in a common
programming language, such as C and proved to be faster than a commercial
library, namely, Bullet.

Abstract: Advances in the control of autonomous systems have accompanied an expansion
in the potential applications for autonomous robotic systems. The success of
applications involving humans depends on the quality of interaction between the
autonomous system and the human supervisor, which is particularly affected by
the degree of trust that the supervisor places in the autonomous system. Absent
from the literature are models of supervisor trust dynamics that can
accommodate asymmetric responses to autonomous system performance and the
intermittent nature of supervisor-autonomous system communication. This paper
focuses on formulating an estimated model of supervisor trust that incorporates
both of these features by employing a switched linear system structure with
event-triggered sampling of the model input and output. Trust response data
collected in a user study with 51 participants were then used identify
parameters for a switched linear model-based observer of supervisor trust.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的2D视频世界模型缺乏几何和空间推理能力，无法充分捕捉3D世界的物理结构，这限制了它们在机器人操作中的应用。

Method: 提出iMoWM模型和MMTokenizer多模态令牌化器，将多模态输入统一为紧凑令牌表示，利用预训练VideoGPT模型实现高效的多模态预测。

Result: 实验表明iMoWM在视觉质量预测、基于模型的强化学习和真实世界模仿学习方面表现优越。

Conclusion: 多模态世界建模为机器人操作提供了更有效的模拟器，展示了在物理信息建模方面的优势。

Abstract: Learned world models hold significant potential for robotic manipulation, as
they can serve as simulator for real-world interactions. While extensive
progress has been made in 2D video-based world models, these approaches often
lack geometric and spatial reasoning, which is essential for capturing the
physical structure of the 3D world. To address this limitation, we introduce
iMoWM, a novel interactive world model designed to generate color images, depth
maps, and robot arm masks in an autoregressive manner conditioned on actions.
To overcome the high computational cost associated with three-dimensional
information, we propose MMTokenizer, which unifies multi-modal inputs into a
compact token representation. This design enables iMoWM to leverage large-scale
pretrained VideoGPT models while maintaining high efficiency and incorporating
richer physical information. With its multi-modal representation, iMoWM not
only improves the visual quality of future predictions but also serves as an
effective simulator for model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) and
facilitates real-world imitation learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superiority of iMoWM across these tasks, showcasing the advantages of
multi-modal world modeling for robotic manipulation. Homepage:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器人更深入融入社会，检测机器人错误对于有效的人机交互至关重要。当机器人反复失败时，需要知道何时改变行为。人类对机器人错误的反应会随着连续失败而加剧，从困惑到明显沮丧，这些演化反应可以揭示连续失败。

Method: 在26名参与者与反复犯对话错误的机器人互动的研究中，从视频数据中提取行为特征，为个体用户训练机器学习模型来识别机器人失败阶段。

Result: 最佳模型在检测错误方面达到93.5%的准确率，在分类连续失败方面达到84.1%的准确率。

Conclusion: 对人类反应进展进行建模可以增强错误检测能力，并更好地理解人机交互中重复的交互中断。

Abstract: As robots become more integrated into society, detecting robot errors is
essential for effective human-robot interaction (HRI). When a robot fails
repeatedly, how can it know when to change its behavior? Humans naturally
respond to robot errors through verbal and nonverbal cues that intensify over
successive failures-from confusion and subtle speech changes to visible
frustration and impatience. While prior work shows that human reactions can
indicate robot failures, few studies examine how these evolving responses
reveal successive failures. This research uses machine learning to recognize
stages of robot failure from human reactions. In a study with 26 participants
interacting with a robot that made repeated conversational errors, behavioral
features were extracted from video data to train models for individual users.
The best model achieved 93.5% accuracy for detecting errors and 84.1% for
classifying successive failures. Modeling the progression of human reactions
enhances error detection and understanding of repeated interaction breakdowns
in HRI.

Conclusion: 所提出的视觉教学-重复导航系统能够有效应对环境变化和动态障碍物，实现稳健的轨迹重复导航。

Abstract: Visual Teach-and-Repeat Navigation is a direct solution for mobile robot to
be deployed in unknown environments. However, robust trajectory repeat
navigation still remains challenged due to environmental changing and dynamic
objects. In this paper, we propose a novel visual teach-and-repeat navigation
system, which consists of a flexible map representation, robust map matching
and a map-less local navigation module. During the teaching process, the
recorded keyframes are formulated as a topo-metric graph and each node can be
further extended to save new observations. Such representation also alleviates
the requirement of globally consistent mapping. To enhance the place
recognition performance during repeating process, instead of using
frame-to-frame matching, we firstly implement keyframe clustering to aggregate
similar connected keyframes into local map and perform place recognition based
on visual frame-tolocal map matching strategy. To promote the local goal
persistent tracking performance, a long-term goal management algorithm is
constructed, which can avoid the robot getting lost due to environmental
changes or obstacle occlusion. To achieve the goal without map, a local
trajectory-control candidate optimization algorithm is proposed. Extensively
experiments are conducted on our mobile platform. The results demonstrate that
our system is superior to the baselines in terms of robustness and
effectiveness.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种从受限专家演示中学习更优策略的方法，通过推断状态奖励信号和自标注未知状态奖励，超越了传统模仿学习的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 专家演示通常受到界面限制（如遥操作、设置限制、硬件安全），导致演示行为不是最优的，这限制了学习策略的性能。

Method: 使用演示推断仅基于状态的任务进度奖励信号，通过时间插值为未知状态自标注奖励，让智能体探索比演示更短更高效的轨迹。

Result: 该方法在样本效率和任务完成时间上都优于常见模仿学习方法，在真实WidowX机械臂上完成任务仅需12秒，比行为克隆快10倍。

Conclusion: 通过超越直接模仿专家动作，利用推断的奖励信号探索更优轨迹，可以实现比受限专家演示更好的性能。

Abstract: Learning from demonstrations enables experts to teach robots complex tasks
using interfaces such as kinesthetic teaching, joystick control, and
sim-to-real transfer. However, these interfaces often constrain the expert's
ability to demonstrate optimal behavior due to indirect control, setup
restrictions, and hardware safety. For example, a joystick can move a robotic
arm only in a 2D plane, even though the robot operates in a higher-dimensional
space. As a result, the demonstrations collected by constrained experts lead to
suboptimal performance of the learned policies. This raises a key question: Can
a robot learn a better policy than the one demonstrated by a constrained
expert? We address this by allowing the agent to go beyond direct imitation of
expert actions and explore shorter and more efficient trajectories. We use the
demonstrations to infer a state-only reward signal that measures task progress,
and self-label reward for unknown states using temporal interpolation. Our
approach outperforms common imitation learning in both sample efficiency and
task completion time. On a real WidowX robotic arm, it completes the task in 12
seconds, 10x faster than behavioral cloning, as shown in real-robot videos on
https://sites.google.com/view/constrainedexpert .

Motivation: 解决多机器人导航中全局战略远见与局部战术敏捷性之间的基本权衡问题，特别是在通信受限环境下。集中式方法通信开销大，分布式方法缺乏全局意识易陷入死锁。

Method: 分层框架：战略层通过机会性相遇构建和交换轻量级拓扑地图，实现抽象级高效路径规划；战术层基于局部度量信息，采用基于采样的逃逸点策略实时生成动态可行轨迹。

Result: 在通信受限且拓扑结构复杂的环境中，系统在成功率和效率方面显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 该去中心化分层框架成功平衡了全局战略规划和局部实时避障，在复杂环境下表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Multi-robot navigation in unknown, structurally constrained, and GPS-denied
environments presents a fundamental trade-off between global strategic
foresight and local tactical agility, particularly under limited communication.
Centralized methods achieve global optimality but suffer from high
communication overhead, while distributed methods are efficient but lack the
broader awareness to avoid deadlocks and topological traps. To address this, we
propose a fully decentralized, hierarchical relative navigation framework that
achieves both strategic foresight and tactical agility without a unified
coordinate system. At the strategic layer, robots build and exchange
lightweight topological maps upon opportunistic encounters. This process
fosters an emergent global awareness, enabling the planning of efficient,
trap-avoiding routes at an abstract level. This high-level plan then inspires
the tactical layer, which operates on local metric information. Here, a
sampling-based escape point strategy resolves dense spatio-temporal conflicts
by generating dynamically feasible trajectories in real time, concurrently
satisfying tight environmental and kinodynamic constraints. Extensive
simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that our system
significantly outperforms in success rate and efficiency, especially in
communication-limited environments with complex topological structures.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅计算效率高，还能批量处理问题实例，并生成多样化的轨迹，展现了在集中式多机器人轨迹优化方面的突破性进展。

Abstract: Centralized trajectory optimization in the joint space of multiple robots
allows access to a larger feasible space that can result in smoother
trajectories, especially while planning in tight spaces. Unfortunately, it is
often computationally intractable beyond a very small swarm size. In this
paper, we propose Flow-Opt, a learning-based approach towards improving the
computational tractability of centralized multi-robot trajectory optimization.
Specifically, we reduce the problem to first learning a generative model to
sample different candidate trajectories and then using a learned
Safety-Filter(SF) to ensure fast inference-time constraint satisfaction. We
propose a flow-matching model with a diffusion transformer (DiT) augmented with
permutation invariant robot position and map encoders as the generative model.
We develop a custom solver for our SF and equip it with a neural network that
predicts context-specific initialization. The initialization network is trained
in a self-supervised manner, taking advantage of the differentiability of the
SF solver. We advance the state-of-the-art in the following respects. First, we
show that we can generate trajectories of tens of robots in cluttered
environments in a few tens of milliseconds. This is several times faster than
existing centralized optimization approaches. Moreover, our approach also
generates smoother trajectories orders of magnitude faster than competing
baselines based on diffusion models. Second, each component of our approach can
be batched, allowing us to solve a few tens of problem instances in a fraction
of a second. We believe this is a first such result; no existing approach
provides such capabilities. Finally, our approach can generate a diverse set of
trajectories between a given set of start and goal locations, which can capture
different collision-avoidance behaviors.

TL;DR: 提出了一种仅使用4个电机的轻量化（311克）假肢手，通过单轴拇指和优化的拇指位置实现基本抓握姿势和手内操作（精确抓握和侧向抓握之间的重新定向）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电动假肢手需要轻量化以减轻用户负担，外形像人手用于美观目的，并将电机内置以保护免受损坏和污垢。除了执行日常活动的能力外，这些特性对于日常使用至关重要。手内操作对于执行日常活动是必要的，例如在不同姿势之间转换，特别是通过旋转运动。

Method: 结合单轴拇指和优化的拇指位置，仅使用四个电机实现基本姿势和手内操作（精确抓握和侧向抓握之间的重新定向）。

Result: 使用各种宽度（5-30毫米）和形状（圆柱体和棱柱）的原始物体进行实验验证，重新定向任务的成功率为90-100%。该手成功执行了印章盖章和USB设备插入，以及旋转操作螺丝刀。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了轻量化假肢手的手内操作功能，仅使用四个电机，重量为311克，能够完成日常活动中的重新定向任务。

Abstract: Electric prosthetic hands should be lightweight to decrease the burden on the
user, shaped like human hands for cosmetic purposes, and have motors inside to
protect them from damage and dirt. In addition to the ability to perform daily
activities, these features are essential for everyday use of the hand. In-hand
manipulation is necessary to perform daily activities such as transitioning
between different postures, particularly through rotational movements, such as
reorienting cards before slot insertion and operating tools such as
screwdrivers. However, currently used electric prosthetic hands only achieve
static grasp postures, and existing manipulation approaches require either many
motors, which makes the prosthesis heavy for daily use in the hand, or complex
mechanisms that demand a large internal space and force external motor
placement, complicating attachment and exposing the components to damage.
Alternatively, we combine a single-axis thumb and optimized thumb positioning
to achieve basic posture and in-hand manipulation, that is, the reorientation
between precision and lateral grasps, using only four motors in a lightweight
(311 g) prosthetic hand. Experimental validation using primitive objects of
various widths (5-30 mm) and shapes (cylinders and prisms) resulted in success
rates of 90-100% for reorientation tasks. The hand performed seal stamping and
USB device insertion, as well as rotation to operate a screwdriver.

Abstract: Seamless loco-manipulation in unstructured environments requires robots to
leverage autonomous exploration alongside whole-body control for physical
interaction. In this work, we introduce HANDO (Hierarchical Autonomous
Navigation and Dexterous Omni-loco-manipulation), a two-layer framework
designed for legged robots equipped with manipulators to perform human-centered
mobile manipulation tasks. The first layer utilizes a goal-conditioned
autonomous exploration policy to guide the robot to semantically specified
targets, such as a black office chair in a dynamic environment. The second
layer employs a unified whole-body loco-manipulation policy to coordinate the
arm and legs for precise interaction tasks-for example, handing a drink to a
person seated on the chair. We have conducted an initial deployment of the
navigation module, and will continue to pursue finer-grained deployment of
whole-body loco-manipulation.

Abstract: Learning-based motion planning can quickly generate near-optimal
trajectories. However, it often requires either large training datasets or
costly collection of human demonstrations. This work proposes an alternative
approach that quickly generates smooth, near-optimal collision-free 3D
Cartesian trajectories from a single artificial demonstration. The
demonstration is encoded as a Dynamic Movement Primitive (DMP) and iteratively
reshaped using policy-based reinforcement learning to create a diverse
trajectory dataset for varying obstacle configurations. This dataset is used to
train a neural network that takes as inputs the task parameters describing the
obstacle dimensions and location, derived automatically from a point cloud, and
outputs the DMP parameters that generate the trajectory. The approach is
validated in simulation and real-robot experiments, outperforming a RRT-Connect
baseline in terms of computation and execution time, as well as trajectory
length, while supporting multi-modal trajectory generation for different
obstacle geometries and end-effector dimensions. Videos and the implementation

outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all scenarios for generating
diverse valid poses. A pick&place pipeline built on our framework achieved a
90% success rate over 120 real-world deployments. This work positions Placeit!
as a powerful tool for open-environment pick-and-place tasks and as a valuable
engine for generating the data needed to train simulation-based foundation
models in robotics.

Abstract: Ensuring robust robotic navigation in dynamic environments is a key
challenge, as traditional testing methods often struggle to cover the full
spectrum of operational requirements. This paper presents the industrial
adoption of Surrealist, a simulation-based test generation framework originally
for UAVs, now applied to the ANYmal quadrupedal robot for industrial
inspection. Our method uses a search-based algorithm to automatically generate
challenging obstacle avoidance scenarios, uncovering failures often missed by
manual testing. In a pilot phase, generated test suites revealed critical
weaknesses in one experimental algorithm (40.3% success rate) and served as an
effective benchmark to prove the superior robustness of another (71.2% success
rate). The framework was then integrated into the ANYbotics workflow for a
six-month industrial evaluation, where it was used to test five proprietary
algorithms. A formal survey confirmed its value, showing it enhances the
development process, uncovers critical failures, provides objective benchmarks,
and strengthens the overall verification pipeline.

*Ralf Römer,Adrian Kobras,Luca Worbis,Angela P. Schoellig*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FIPER是一个用于生成式模仿学习策略的运行时故障预测框架，无需故障数据，通过检测分布外观察和动作不确定性来预测故障。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式模仿学习虽然能让机器人执行复杂任务，但分布偏移和动作误差累积仍会导致不可预测的不安全行为，需要运行时故障预测来确保在人类环境和安全关键场景中的部署安全。

Method: FIPER识别两个关键故障指标：(i)通过随机网络蒸馏在嵌入空间检测分布外观察；(ii)通过新颖的动作块熵评分测量生成动作的不确定性。使用保形预测校准故障预测分数，当两个指标在短时间窗口内超过阈值时触发故障警报。

Result: 在五个仿真和真实环境中的评估表明，FIPER能更好地区分实际故障与良性分布外情况，比现有方法更准确、更早地预测故障。

Conclusion: 这项工作是实现更可解释和更安全的生成式机器人策略的重要一步。

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) with generative models, such as diffusion and flow
matching, has enabled robots to perform complex, long-horizon tasks. However,
distribution shifts from unseen environments or compounding action errors can
still cause unpredictable and unsafe behavior, leading to task failure. Early
failure prediction during runtime is therefore essential for deploying robots
in human-centered and safety-critical environments. We propose FIPER, a general
framework for Failure Prediction at Runtime for generative IL policies that
does not require failure data. FIPER identifies two key indicators of impending
failure: (i) out-of-distribution (OOD) observations detected via random network
distillation in the policy's embedding space, and (ii) high uncertainty in
generated actions measured by a novel action-chunk entropy score. Both failure
prediction scores are calibrated using a small set of successful rollouts via
conformal prediction. A failure alarm is triggered when both indicators,
aggregated over short time windows, exceed their thresholds. We evaluate FIPER
across five simulation and real-world environments involving diverse failure
modes. Our results demonstrate that FIPER better distinguishes actual failures
from benign OOD situations and predicts failures more accurately and earlier
than existing methods. We thus consider this work an important step towards
more interpretable and safer generative robot policies. Code, data and videos

Motivation: 当前动态场景图方法难以捕捉随机动态、部分可观测性和多智能体活动，而这些对于具身AI在不确定性和延迟感知下行动至关重要。

Method: 将动态场景图与离散事件仿真融合，建模对象动态、智能体观测和大规模交互，研究不确定性传播、有限感知下的规划以及涌现的多智能体行为。

Conclusion: 通过结合结构化表示和高效仿真，FOGMACHINE为复杂不确定环境中的基准测试、模型训练和具身AI发展建立了有效工具。

Abstract: Dynamic Scene Graphs (DSGs) provide a structured representation of
hierarchical, interconnected environments, but current approaches struggle to
capture stochastic dynamics, partial observability, and multi-agent activity.
These aspects are critical for embodied AI, where agents must act under
uncertainty and delayed perception. We introduce FOGMACHINE , an open-source
framework that fuses DSGs with discrete-event simulation to model object
dynamics, agent observations, and interactions at scale. This setup enables the
study of uncertainty propagation, planning under limited perception, and
emergent multi-agent behavior. Experiments in urban scenarios illustrate
realistic temporal and spatial patterns while revealing the challenges of
belief estimation under sparse observations. By combining structured
representations with efficient simulation, FOGMACHINE establishes an effective
tool for benchmarking, model training, and advancing embodied AI in complex,
uncertain environments.

Conclusion: 该框架展示了在复杂血管环境中实现软体机器人导丝自主导航的可行性，并通过消融研究验证了设计选择的有效性

Abstract: In endovascular surgery, endovascular interventionists push a thin tube
called a catheter, guided by a thin wire to a treatment site inside the
patient's blood vessels to treat various conditions such as blood clots,
aneurysms, and malformations. Guidewires with robotic tips can enhance
maneuverability, but they present challenges in modeling and control.
Automation of soft robotic guidewire navigation has the potential to overcome
these challenges, increasing the precision and safety of endovascular
navigation. In other surgical domains, end-to-end imitation learning has shown
promising results. Thus, we develop a transformer-based imitation learning
framework with goal conditioning, relative action outputs, and automatic
contrast dye injections to enable generalizable soft robotic guidewire
navigation in an aneurysm targeting task. We train the model on 36 different
modular bifurcated geometries, generating 647 total demonstrations under
simulated fluoroscopy, and evaluate it on three previously unseen vascular
geometries. The model can autonomously drive the tip of the robot to the
aneurysm location with a success rate of 83% on the unseen geometries,
outperforming several baselines. In addition, we present ablation and baseline
studies to evaluate the effectiveness of each design and data collection
choice. Project website: https://softrobotnavigation.github.io/

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动物通过其固有的被动动力学实现高能效运动，而现有的模仿学习方法主要关注显性步态模式，忽略了这种被动动力学特性。

Method: 将基于物理的冲击缓解因子(IMF)作为奖励项整合到对抗运动先验(AMP)和强化学习框架中，使策略能够同时学习参考运动的轨迹和被动动态特性。

Result: 在AMP和手工设计奖励结构中都实现了高达32%的能量效率提升，通过运输成本(CoT)指标衡量。

Conclusion: 通过整合IMF指标，成功让强化学习策略同时学习显性运动模式和隐性被动动力学，显著提高了机器人的能量效率。

Abstract: Animals achieve energy-efficient locomotion by their implicit passive
dynamics, a marvel that has captivated roboticists for decades.Recently,
methods incorporated Adversarial Motion Prior (AMP) and Reinforcement learning
(RL) shows promising progress to replicate Animals' naturalistic motion.
However, such imitation learning approaches predominantly capture explicit
kinematic patterns, so-called gaits, while overlooking the implicit passive
dynamics. This work bridges this gap by incorporating a reward term guided by
Impact Mitigation Factor (IMF), a physics-informed metric that quantifies a
robot's ability to passively mitigate impacts. By integrating IMF with AMP, our
approach enables RL policies to learn both explicit motion trajectories from
animal reference motion and the implicit passive dynamic. We demonstrate energy
efficiency improvements of up to 32%, as measured by the Cost of Transport
(CoT), across both AMP and handcrafted reward structure.

Conclusion: AIMAPP提供了一个生物启发的模块化解决方案，用于在非结构化环境中实现可扩展的自监督导航。

Abstract: Autonomous navigation in unfamiliar environments requires robots to
simultaneously explore, localise, and plan under uncertainty, without relying
on predefined maps or extensive training. We present a biologically inspired,
Active Inference-based framework, Active Inference MAPping and Planning
(AIMAPP). This model unifies mapping, localisation, and decision-making within
a single generative model. Inspired by hippocampal navigation, it uses
topological reasoning, place-cell encoding, and episodic memory to guide
behaviour. The agent builds and updates a sparse topological map online, learns
state transitions dynamically, and plans actions by minimising Expected Free
Energy. This allows it to balance goal-directed and exploratory behaviours. We
implemented a ROS-compatible navigation system that is sensor and
robot-agnostic, capable of integrating with diverse hardware configurations. It
operates in a fully self-supervised manner, is resilient to drift, and supports
both exploration and goal-directed navigation without any pre-training. We
demonstrate robust performance in large-scale real and simulated environments
against state-of-the-art planning models, highlighting the system's
adaptability to ambiguous observations, environmental changes, and sensor
noise. The model offers a biologically inspired, modular solution to scalable,
self-supervised navigation in unstructured settings. AIMAPP is available at

Conclusion: 该数据驱动方法有效替代了昂贵的程序化评估，显著加速了网格简化过程，为高质量网格生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The sizing field defined on a triangular background grid is pivotal for
controlling the quality and efficiency of unstructured mesh generation.
However, creating an optimal background grid that is geometrically conforming,
computationally lightweight, and free from artifacts like banding is a
significant challenge. This paper introduces a novel, adaptive background grid
simplification (ABGS) framework based on a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN).
We reformulate the grid simplification task as an edge score regression problem
and train a GCN model to efficiently predict optimal edge collapse candidates.
The model is guided by a custom loss function that holistically considers both
geometric fidelity and sizing field accuracy. This data-driven approach
replaces a costly procedural evaluation, accelerating the simplification
process. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework
across diverse and complex engineering models. Compared to the initial dense
grids, our simplified background grids achieve an element reduction of 74%-94%,
leading to a 35%-88% decrease in sizing field query times.

Abstract: Recent advancements in AI-driven 3D model generation have leveraged cross

overhead remain challenges. This paper introduces a novel multi-stage framework
for generating 3D models composed of parameterized primitives, guided by

surface quality of the model, while retaining only the parameters of
parameterized primitives. Experiments on virtual scene dataset and real scene

Method: 通过分析梯度优化如何形成马尔可夫链，结合MCMC采样方法，探索参数空间。提供理论和实践工具，包括Jupyter笔记本演示，帮助学生、研究人员和从业者理解这些组件。

Conclusion: MCMC方法在生成式AI和基于物理的渲染中发挥着关键作用，本课程为这两个领域的统一提供了初步框架和实用工具，促进了物理真实感生成渲染的共同目标。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has made unprecedented advances in
vision language models over the past two years. During the generative process,
new samples (images) are generated from an unknown high-dimensional
distribution. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are particularly
effective in drawing samples from such complex, high-dimensional distributions.
This makes MCMC methods an integral component for models like EBMs, ensuring
accurate sample generation.
  Gradient-based optimization is at the core of modern generative models. The
update step during the optimization forms a Markov chain where the new update
depends only on the current state. This allows exploration of the parameter
space in a memoryless manner, thus combining the benefits of gradient-based
optimization and MCMC sampling. MCMC methods have shown an equally important
role in physically based rendering where complex light paths are otherwise
quite challenging to sample from simple importance sampling techniques.
  A lot of research is dedicated towards bringing physical realism to samples
(images) generated from diffusion-based generative models in a data-driven
manner, however, a unified framework connecting these techniques is still
missing. In this course, we take the first steps toward understanding each of
these components and exploring how MCMC could potentially serve as a bridge,
linking these closely related areas of research. Our course aims to provide
necessary theoretical and practical tools to guide students, researchers and
practitioners towards the common goal of generative physically based rendering.

Motivation: 动态线集的实时渲染在可视化任务中很重要，但高质量全局光照和透明度在交互速率下难以实现，需要解决密集线集的空间结构表达问题。

Method: 开发了支持体素锥追踪和射线追踪加速结构的高效体素化算法，并提出了基于体素的剔除方法，限制加速结构构建到相机可见体素，减少每帧预处理成本。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架能够实现具有物理准确透明度的大型动态线集的高质量实时渲染，在质量和性能方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Real-time rendering of dynamic line sets is relevant in many visualization
tasks, including unsteady flow visualization and interactive white matter
reconstruction from Magnetic Resonance Imaging. High-quality global
illumination and transparency are important for conveying the spatial structure
of dense line sets, yet remain difficult to achieve at interactive rates. We
propose an efficient voxel-based ray-tracing framework for rendering large
dynamic line sets with ambient occlusion and ground-truth transparency. The
framework introduces a voxelization algorithm that supports efficient
construction of acceleration structures for both voxel cone tracing and ray
tracing. To further reduce per-frame preprocessing cost, we developed a
voxel-based culling method that restricts acceleration structure construction
to camera-visible voxels. Together, these contributions enable high-quality,
real-time rendering of large-scale dynamic line sets with physically accurate
transparency. The results show that our method outperforms the state of the art
in quality and performance when rendering (semi-)opaque dynamic line sets.

Motivation: 户外场景重建面临挑战，因为近景纹理丰富区域与远景低细节、光照不均和天空效果区域形成鲜明对比，现有方法难以同时处理这两种区域。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：第一阶段在球形壳内初始化背景基元，使用结合背景光度损失和几何正则化的损失函数进行优化；第二阶段从SfM重建初始化前景高斯，使用标准渲染损失进行细化，背景保持固定。

Result: 在多样化户外数据集上的实验表明，该方法减少了背景伪影，相比最先进基线方法提高了感知质量。

Conclusion: 显式的背景分离实现了自动、无对象的环境图估计，为逼真的户外渲染和混合现实应用开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Outdoor scene reconstruction remains challenging due to the stark contrast
between well-textured, nearby regions and distant backgrounds dominated by low
detail, uneven illumination, and sky effects. We introduce a two-stage Gaussian
Splatting framework that explicitly separates and optimizes these regions,
yielding higher-fidelity novel view synthesis. In stage one, background
primitives are initialized within a spherical shell and optimized using a loss
that combines a background-only photometric term with two geometric
regularizers: one constraining Gaussians to remain inside the shell, and
another aligning them with local tangential planes. In stage two, foreground
Gaussians are initialized from a Structure-from-Motion reconstruction, added
and refined using the standard rendering loss, while the background set remains
fixed but contributes to the final image formation. Experiments on diverse
outdoor datasets show that our method reduces background artifacts and improves
perceptual quality compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, the
explicit background separation enables automatic, object-free environment map
estimation, opening new possibilities for photorealistic outdoor rendering and
mixed-reality applications.

Conclusion: 虽然湿实验室验证仍然不可或缺，但在癌症队列上的实验表明，社会结构化的智能体网络能够支持规模化的探索性假设探索。

Abstract: Large-scale scientific datasets -- spanning health biobanks, cell atlases,
Earth reanalyses, and more -- create opportunities for exploratory discovery
unconstrained by specific research questions. We term this process hypothesis
hunting: the cumulative search for insight through sustained exploration across
vast and complex hypothesis spaces. To support it, we introduce AScience, a
framework modeling discovery as the interaction of agents, networks, and
evaluation norms, and implement it as ASCollab, a distributed system of
LLM-based research agents with heterogeneous behaviors. These agents
self-organize into evolving networks, continually producing and peer-reviewing
findings under shared standards of evaluation. Experiments show that such
social dynamics enable the accumulation of expert-rated results along the
diversity-quality-novelty frontier, including rediscoveries of established
biomarkers, extensions of known pathways, and proposals of new therapeutic
targets. While wet-lab validation remains indispensable, our experiments on
cancer cohorts demonstrate that socially structured, agentic networks can
sustain exploratory hypothesis hunting at scale.

Motivation: 印度电商市场快速增长，最后一公里配送占运营成本近一半。传统VRP求解器在现实场景中因非结构化地址、不完整地图和计算限制而效果有限。

Method: 开发了一个框架，使用LLMs根据政策标准对VRP生成的路线进行批判性评估。生成了400个案例进行标注和评估。

Result: 开源LLMs识别路线问题的准确率达79%，专有推理模型可达86%。LLM评估超越了传统的距离和时间指标。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的VRP路线评估是一个有效且可扩展的评估层，有助于提高成本效率、配送可靠性和可持续性，特别适用于印度等发展中国家。

Abstract: Indias e-commerce market is projected to grow rapidly, with last-mile
delivery accounting for nearly half of operational expenses. Although vehicle
routing problem (VRP) based solvers are widely used for delivery planning,
their effectiveness in real-world scenarios is limited due to unstructured
addresses, incomplete maps, and computational constraints in distance
estimation. This study proposes a framework that employs large language models
(LLMs) to critique VRP-generated routes against policy-based criteria, allowing
logistics operators to evaluate and prioritise more efficient delivery plans.
As a illustration of our approach we generate, annotate and evaluated 400 cases
using large language models. Our study found that open-source LLMs identified
routing issues with 79% accuracy, while proprietary reasoning models achieved
reach upto 86%. The results demonstrate that LLM-based evaluation of
VRP-generated routes can be an effective and scalable layer of evaluation which
goes beyond beyond conventional distance and time based metrics. This has
implications for improving cost efficiency, delivery reliability, and
sustainability in last-mile logistics, especially for developing countries like
India.

Conclusion: UniWM是实现统一、想象力驱动的具身导航的重要进展，证明了在单一框架中集成视觉想象和规划的有效性。

Abstract: Enabling embodied agents to effectively imagine future states is critical for
robust and generalizable visual navigation. Current state-of-the-art
approaches, however, adopt modular architectures that separate navigation
planning from visual world modeling, leading to state-action misalignment and
limited adaptability in novel or dynamic scenarios. To overcome this
fundamental limitation, we propose UniWM, a unified, memory-augmented world
model integrating egocentric visual foresight and planning within a single
multimodal autoregressive backbone. Unlike modular frameworks, UniWM explicitly
grounds action decisions in visually imagined outcomes, ensuring tight
alignment between prediction and control. A hierarchical memory mechanism
further integrates detailed short-term perceptual cues with longer-term
trajectory context, enabling stable, coherent reasoning over extended horizons.
Extensive experiments across four challenging benchmarks (Go Stanford, ReCon,
SCAND, HuRoN) demonstrate that UniWM substantially improves navigation success
rates by up to 30%, significantly reduces trajectory errors compared to strong
baselines, and exhibits impressive zero-shot generalization on the unseen
TartanDrive dataset. These results highlight UniWM as a principled step toward
unified, imagination-driven embodied navigation.

*Pantea Karimi,Dany Rouhana,Pooria Namyar,Siva Kesava Reddy Kakarla,Venkat Arun,Behnaz Arzani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 通过向LLM提供启发式算法表现不佳的实例、解释原因并进行区域专业化设计，可以生成比现有技术更鲁棒的启发式算法，在最坏情况下性能提升约28倍，同时保持运行时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的使用LLM设计启发式算法的方法缺乏对算法表现不佳原因的解释和改进建议，导致生成的启发式算法不够鲁棒。

Method: 采用三个简单策略：(1)向LLM展示启发式算法表现不佳的实例；(2)解释表现不佳的原因；(3)在输入空间的不同区域进行专业化设计。

Result: 生成的启发式算法相比FunSearch在最坏情况下性能提升约28倍，平均性能也有所改善，同时保持运行时间不变。

Conclusion: 通过向LLM提供失败案例分析和区域专业化设计，可以显著提升启发式算法的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: We posit that we can generate more robust and performant heuristics if we
augment approaches using LLMs for heuristic design with tools that explain why
heuristics underperform and suggestions about how to fix them. We find even
simple ideas that (1) expose the LLM to instances where the heuristic
underperforms; (2) explain why they occur; and (3) specialize design to regions
in the input space, can produce more robust algorithms compared to existing
techniques~ -- ~the heuristics we produce have a $\sim28\times$ better
worst-case performance compared to FunSearch, improve average performance, and
maintain the runtime.

*Guangya Wan,Mingyang Ling,Xiaoqi Ren,Rujun Han,Sheng Li,Zizhao Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: COMPASS是一个轻量级分层框架，通过将战术执行、战略监督和上下文管理分离为三个专门组件，解决了LLM代理在长时程任务中的上下文管理瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长时程任务需要持续推理和多次工具交互，这对LLM代理具有挑战性：小错误会在步骤间累积，即使最先进的模型也经常产生幻觉或失去连贯性。上下文管理被确定为关键瓶颈。

Method: 提出COMPASS框架，包含三个专门组件：(1)主代理执行推理和工具使用，(2)元思考者监控进度并发出战略干预，(3)上下文管理器为不同推理阶段维护简洁相关的进度简报。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的基准测试（GAIA、BrowseComp和Humanity's Last Exam）中，COMPASS相比单代理和多代理基线将准确率提高了高达20%。

Conclusion: COMPASS通过专门的上下文管理有效解决了长时程任务中的推理连贯性问题，并通过测试时扩展和训练后流水线进一步提升了性能和效率。

Abstract: Long-horizon tasks that require sustained reasoning and multiple tool
interactions remain challenging for LLM agents: small errors compound across
steps, and even state-of-the-art models often hallucinate or lose coherence. We
identify context management as the central bottleneck -- extended histories
cause agents to overlook critical evidence or become distracted by irrelevant
information, thus failing to replan or reflect from previous mistakes. To
address this, we propose COMPASS (Context-Organized Multi-Agent Planning and
Strategy System), a lightweight hierarchical framework that separates tactical
execution, strategic oversight, and context organization into three specialized
components: (1) a Main Agent that performs reasoning and tool use, (2) a
Meta-Thinker that monitors progress and issues strategic interventions, and (3)
a Context Manager that maintains concise, relevant progress briefs for
different reasoning stages. Across three challenging benchmarks -- GAIA,
BrowseComp, and Humanity's Last Exam -- COMPASS improves accuracy by up to 20%
relative to both single- and multi-agent baselines. We further introduce a
test-time scaling extension that elevates performance to match established
DeepResearch agents, and a post-training pipeline that delegates context
management to smaller models for enhanced efficiency.

*Wouter Haverals,Meredith Martin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究通过控制实验比较人类和AI对文学风格的评估，发现两者都存在系统性的人类偏好偏见，且AI的偏见比人类更强（2.5倍）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI写作工具的普及，需要理解人类和机器如何评估文学风格这一主观领域，特别是评估中的归因偏见问题。

Method: 研究1：比较556名人类参与者和13个AI模型对Queneau作品与GPT-4生成版本的评估（盲评、准确标签、反事实标签）；研究2：在14×14的AI评估者-创作者矩阵中测试偏见泛化。

Result: 人类显示+13.7个百分点的偏见，AI显示+34.3个百分点的偏见（2.5倍更强）。AI系统在内容被标记为"AI生成"时会系统性地贬低创意内容，无论实际由哪个AI创作。

Conclusion: AI模型在训练过程中吸收了人类对人工创造力的文化偏见，不仅复制而且放大了人类的归因偏见倾向。

Abstract: As AI writing tools become widespread, we need to understand how both humans
and machines evaluate literary style, a domain where objective standards are
elusive and judgments are inherently subjective. We conducted controlled
experiments using Raymond Queneau's Exercises in Style (1947) to measure
attribution bias across evaluators. Study 1 compared human participants (N=556)
and AI models (N=13) evaluating literary passages from Queneau versus
GPT-4-generated versions under three conditions: blind, accurately labeled, and
counterfactually labeled. Study 2 tested bias generalization across a
14$\times$14 matrix of AI evaluators and creators. Both studies revealed
systematic pro-human attribution bias. Humans showed +13.7 percentage point
(pp) bias (Cohen's h = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.21-0.34), while AI models showed +34.3
percentage point bias (h = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.65-0.76), a 2.5-fold stronger effect
(P$<$0.001). Study 2 confirmed this bias operates across AI architectures
(+25.8pp, 95% CI: 24.1-27.6%), demonstrating that AI systems systematically
devalue creative content when labeled as "AI-generated" regardless of which AI
created it. We also find that attribution labels cause evaluators to invert
assessment criteria, with identical features receiving opposing evaluations
based solely on perceived authorship. This suggests AI models have absorbed
human cultural biases against artificial creativity during training. Our study
represents the first controlled comparison of attribution bias between human
and artificial evaluators in aesthetic judgment, revealing that AI systems not
only replicate but amplify this human tendency.

TL;DR: 提出了Agent GPA评估框架，基于目标-计划-行动的操作循环，包含五个评估指标，能系统性地覆盖广泛的智能体失败情况，并与人工标注高度一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要一种系统性的方法来评估智能体的表现，覆盖各种可能的失败模式，并提供可操作的改进建议。

Method: 基于目标-计划-行动循环的评估框架，包含目标达成度、逻辑一致性、执行效率、计划质量和计划遵循度五个指标，使用LLM作为评判者。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的实验表明，该框架能覆盖TRAIL/GAIA基准数据集中的所有智能体错误，LLM评判者与人工标注的一致性达到80%-95%，错误定位准确率达86%。

Conclusion: Agent GPA框架为智能体评估提供了系统化方法，能够全面覆盖失败模式，支持准确的错误定位，有助于针对性改进智能体性能。

Abstract: We introduce the Agent GPA (Goal-Plan-Action) framework: an evaluation
paradigm based on an agent's operational loop of setting goals, devising plans,
and executing actions. The framework includes five evaluation metrics: Goal
Fulfillment, Logical Consistency, Execution Efficiency, Plan Quality, and Plan
Adherence. Logical Consistency checks that an agent's actions are consistent
with its prior actions. Execution Efficiency checks whether the agent executes
in the most efficient way to achieve its goal. Plan Quality checks whether an
agent's plans are aligned with its goals; Plan Adherence checks if an agent's
actions are aligned with its plan; and Goal Fulfillment checks that agent's
final outcomes match the stated goals. Our experimental results on two
benchmark datasets - the public TRAIL/GAIA dataset and an internal dataset for
a production-grade data agent - show that this framework (a) provides a
systematic way to cover a broad range of agent failures, including all agent
errors on the TRAIL/GAIA benchmark dataset; (b) supports LLM-judges that
exhibit strong agreement with human annotation, covering 80% to over 95%
errors; and (c) localizes errors with 86% agreement to enable targeted
improvement of agent performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统同行评审中的不一致性、评审员主观性和可扩展性挑战，通过AI辅助提升评审的系统性和一致性。

Method: 开发了模块化框架ReviewerToo，支持专门的评审员角色和结构化评估标准，可在真实会议工作流程中部分或完全集成。

Result: 在1,963篇ICLR 2025论文上的实验显示，AI评审在事实核查、文献覆盖方面表现优异，但在评估方法新颖性和理论贡献方面仍有不足。

Conclusion: AI可以增强评审的一致性、覆盖面和公平性，但复杂评估仍需领域专家，为混合同行评审系统提供了基础。

Abstract: Peer review is the cornerstone of scientific publishing, yet it suffers from
inconsistencies, reviewer subjectivity, and scalability challenges. We
introduce ReviewerToo, a modular framework for studying and deploying
AI-assisted peer review to complement human judgment with systematic and
consistent assessments. ReviewerToo supports systematic experiments with
specialized reviewer personas and structured evaluation criteria, and can be
partially or fully integrated into real conference workflows. We validate
ReviewerToo on a carefully curated dataset of 1,963 paper submissions from ICLR
2025, where our experiments with the gpt-oss-120b model achieves 81.8% accuracy
for the task of categorizing a paper as accept/reject compared to 83.9% for the
average human reviewer. Additionally, ReviewerToo-generated reviews are rated
as higher quality than the human average by an LLM judge, though still trailing
the strongest expert contributions. Our analysis highlights domains where AI
reviewers excel (e.g., fact-checking, literature coverage) and where they
struggle (e.g., assessing methodological novelty and theoretical
contributions), underscoring the continued need for human expertise. Based on
these findings, we propose guidelines for integrating AI into peer-review
pipelines, showing how AI can enhance consistency, coverage, and fairness while
leaving complex evaluative judgments to domain experts. Our work provides a
foundation for systematic, hybrid peer-review systems that scale with the
growth of scientific publishing.

*Siqi Zhu,David Zhang,Pedro Cisneros-Velarde,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了GTAlign框架，将博弈论决策整合到LLM的推理和训练中，通过构建收益矩阵和互惠奖励来优化LLM与用户的互动，实现双赢结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对齐方法假设最大化模型奖励就能最大化用户福利，但实践中LLM常产生冗长或过度澄清的回答，导致用户满意度下降，形成类似囚徒困境的局面。

Method: 在推理阶段将用户-LLM互动视为策略博弈，构建收益矩阵评估双方福利；在训练阶段引入互惠奖励机制强化合作性回应；还包含基于博弈论的动态响应调整技术。

Result: 实验表明GTAlign相比基线方法显著提升了推理效率、回答质量和互惠福利，适用于多种任务场景。

Conclusion: GTAlign通过博弈论方法有效解决了LLM对齐中的社会效率问题，实现了模型与用户的双赢互动。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in reasoning,
yet sometimes produce responses that are suboptimal for users in tasks such as
writing, information seeking, or providing practical guidance. Conventional
alignment practices typically assume that maximizing model reward also
maximizes user welfare, but this assumption frequently fails in practice:
models may over-clarify or generate overly verbose reasoning when users prefer
concise answers. Such behaviors resemble the prisoner's dilemma, where
individually rational choices lead to socially suboptimal outcomes. The
fundamental challenge is the lack of a principled decision making mechanism
that mutually benefits both the LLM and the user. We propose Game-Theoretic
Alignment (GTAlign), an alignment framework that integrates game-theoretic
decision making into both reasoning and training. During reasoning, the model
explicitly treats user-LLM interaction as a strategic game: it constructs
payoff matrices within its reasoning chain to estimate welfare for both itself
and the user, and then selects actions that are mutually beneficial. During
training, we introduce a mutual welfare reward that reinforces cooperative
responses, aligning model behavior with socially efficient outcomes. In
addition, we introduce an inference technique that leverages game-theoretic
reasoning to dynamically adapt LLM's response when pricing policies of LLM
service change. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GTAlign substantially
improves reasoning efficiency, answer quality, and mutual welfare compared to
baselines across diverse tasks. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态模型基准测试往往无法捕捉它们在实时对抗环境中的真实性能，需要一种动态、交互式的评估方法。

Method: 构建了一个自动化对战平台，让6个领先的开源和闭源模型在《真人快打II》游戏中相互对战，通过解析游戏画面和状态数据来选择行动。

Result: 该框架提供了完全自动化、可重复且客观的评估，能够测试模型在动态环境中的战略推理能力。

Conclusion: LM Fight Arena引入了一个具有挑战性和吸引力的基准测试，弥合了AI评估与交互式娱乐之间的差距。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for large multimodal models (LMMs) often fail to capture
their performance in real-time, adversarial environments. We introduce LM Fight
Arena (Large Model Fight Arena), a novel framework that evaluates LMMs by
pitting them against each other in the classic fighting game Mortal Kombat II,
a task requiring rapid visual understanding and tactical, sequential
decision-making. In a controlled tournament, we test six leading open- and
closed-source models, where each agent operates controlling the same character
to ensure a fair comparison. The models are prompted to interpret game frames
and state data to select their next actions. Unlike static evaluations, LM
Fight Arena provides a fully automated, reproducible, and objective assessment
of an LMM's strategic reasoning capabilities in a dynamic setting. This work
introduces a challenging and engaging benchmark that bridges the gap between AI
evaluation and interactive entertainment.

TL;DR: RADAR是一个基于机制可解释性的框架，通过区分基于记忆和基于推理的模型响应来检测数据污染，在多样化评估集上达到93%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据污染对可靠的LLM评估构成重大挑战，模型可能通过记忆训练数据而非展示真正推理能力来获得高性能表现。

Method: RADAR提取37个特征，涵盖表面级置信度轨迹和深度机制特性，包括注意力专业化、电路动态和激活流模式，使用集成分类器训练这些特征。

Result: RADAR在多样化评估集上达到93%的准确率，在明确案例上表现完美，在具有挑战性的模糊示例上达到76.7%的准确率。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了机制可解释性在超越传统表面级指标推进LLM评估方面的潜力。

Abstract: Data contamination poses a significant challenge to reliable LLM evaluation,
where models may achieve high performance by memorizing training data rather
than demonstrating genuine reasoning capabilities. We introduce RADAR (Recall
vs. Reasoning Detection through Activation Representation), a novel framework
that leverages mechanistic interpretability to detect contamination by
distinguishing recall-based from reasoning-based model responses. RADAR
extracts 37 features spanning surface-level confidence trajectories and deep
mechanistic properties including attention specialization, circuit dynamics,
and activation flow patterns. Using an ensemble of classifiers trained on these
features, RADAR achieves 93\% accuracy on a diverse evaluation set, with
perfect performance on clear cases and 76.7\% accuracy on challenging ambiguous
examples. This work demonstrates the potential of mechanistic interpretability
for advancing LLM evaluation beyond traditional surface-level metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注检索等特定方面，缺乏对RAG管道整体能力的评估，特别是在处理多模态信息方面的表现。

Method: 创建包含文本、表格、图像的多模态问题数据集，开发短语级召回指标和基于最近邻嵌入的幻觉分类器，比较开源和闭源管道的性能。

Result: 闭源管道在正确性和幻觉检测上显著优于开源管道，特别是在多模态和跨文档问题上差距更大。人工评估显示指标与人类判断高度一致。

Conclusion: 该基准有效评估RAG管道的多模态能力，闭源方案表现更好，特别是在复杂多模态场景中。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
improving factual accuracy in large language models (LLMs). We introduce a
benchmark designed to evaluate RAG pipelines as a whole, evaluating a
pipeline's ability to ingest, retrieve, and reason about several modalities of
information, differentiating it from existing benchmarks that focus on
particular aspects such as retrieval. We present (1) a small, human-created
dataset of 93 questions designed to evaluate a pipeline's ability to ingest
textual data, tables, images, and data spread across these modalities in one or
more documents; (2) a phrase-level recall metric for correctness; (3) a
nearest-neighbor embedding classifier to identify potential pipeline
hallucinations; (4) a comparative evaluation of 2 pipelines built with
open-source retrieval mechanisms and 4 closed-source foundation models; and (5)
a third-party human evaluation of the alignment of our correctness and
hallucination metrics. We find that closed-source pipelines significantly
outperform open-source pipelines in both correctness and hallucination metrics,
with wider performance gaps in questions relying on multimodal and
cross-document information. Human evaluation of our metrics showed average
agreement of 4.62 for correctness and 4.53 for hallucination detection on a 1-5
Likert scale (5 indicating "strongly agree").

TL;DR: EcphoryRAG是一个基于认知神经科学启发的实体中心知识图谱RAG框架，通过提取核心实体和元数据实现轻量级索引，多跳关联检索和动态关系推理，在复杂问答任务上达到新的最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类认知神经科学中通过线索激活实体中心记忆痕迹进行复杂多跳回忆的机制启发，旨在开发更高效的RAG框架。

Method: 在索引阶段仅提取和存储核心实体及元数据；检索时先提取查询中的线索实体，然后在知识图谱上进行可扩展的多跳关联搜索，并动态推断实体间的隐式关系来填充上下文。

Result: 在2WikiMultiHop、HotpotQA和MuSiQue基准测试中，EcphoryRAG将平均精确匹配分数从0.392提升到0.474，相比HippoRAG等强KG-RAG方法有显著改进，同时索引阶段token消耗减少高达94%。

Conclusion: 实体-线索-多跳检索范式在复杂问答任务中具有显著效果，验证了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Cognitive neuroscience research indicates that humans leverage cues to
activate entity-centered memory traces (engrams) for complex, multi-hop
recollection. Inspired by this mechanism, we introduce EcphoryRAG, an
entity-centric knowledge graph RAG framework. During indexing, EcphoryRAG
extracts and stores only core entities with corresponding metadata, a
lightweight approach that reduces token consumption by up to 94\% compared to
other structured RAG systems. For retrieval, the system first extracts cue
entities from queries, then performs a scalable multi-hop associative search
across the knowledge graph. Crucially, EcphoryRAG dynamically infers implicit
relations between entities to populate context, enabling deep reasoning without
exhaustive pre-enumeration of relationships. Extensive evaluations on the
2WikiMultiHop, HotpotQA, and MuSiQue benchmarks demonstrate that EcphoryRAG
sets a new state-of-the-art, improving the average Exact Match (EM) score from
0.392 to 0.474 over strong KG-RAG methods like HippoRAG. These results validate
the efficacy of the entity-cue-multi-hop retrieval paradigm for complex
question answering.

TL;DR: 提出Semantic-condition Tuning (SCT)新范式，通过图神经网络提取语义条件并自适应融合文本嵌入，显著提升知识图谱与LLM的融合效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有前缀调优方法简单拼接知识嵌入与文本输入，忽略了知识图谱的丰富关系语义，给LLM带来隐式推理负担

Method: SCT包含语义图模块（使用GNN提取上下文感知语义条件）和条件自适应融合模块（通过参数化投影器自适应调制文本嵌入）

Result: 在知识图谱基准测试中显著优于前缀调优和其他强基线方法

Conclusion: 通过在LLM推理前用语义图上下文调制输入表示，SCT提供更直接有效的信号，实现更准确鲁棒的知识推理

Abstract: Fusing Knowledge Graphs with Large Language Models is crucial for
knowledge-intensive tasks like knowledge graph completion. The prevailing
paradigm, prefix-tuning, simply concatenates knowledge embeddings with text
inputs. However, this shallow fusion overlooks the rich relational semantics
within KGs and imposes a significant implicit reasoning burden on the LLM to
correlate the prefix with the text. To address these, we propose
Semantic-condition Tuning (SCT), a new knowledge injection paradigm comprising
two key modules. First, a Semantic Graph Module employs a Graph Neural Network
to extract a context-aware semantic condition from the local graph
neighborhood, guided by knowledge-enhanced relations. Subsequently, this
condition is passed to a Condition-Adaptive Fusion Module, which, in turn,
adaptively modulates the textual embedding via two parameterized projectors,
enabling a deep, feature-wise, and knowledge-aware interaction. The resulting
pre-fused embedding is then fed into the LLM for fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments on knowledge graph benchmarks demonstrate that SCT significantly
outperforms prefix-tuning and other strong baselines. Our analysis confirms
that by modulating the input representation with semantic graph context before
LLM inference, SCT provides a more direct and potent signal, enabling more
accurate and robust knowledge reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在推理效率方面面临模型尺寸大、过度思考和轻量级场景下准确率下降等挑战，而轻量级MLLMs的推理能力研究较为缺乏。

Method: 采用两阶段优化：第一阶段引入LIPO强化学习方法，动态调整响应优势以鼓励生成更短更准确的响应；第二阶段提出AMM模型融合方法，自适应调整任务向量权重并通过梯度投影正则化损失函数优化合并向量。

Result: 在十个广泛使用的推理基准测试（涵盖数学、结构化数据、OCR和通用能力）上展现出卓越性能，使轻量级模型在多样化多模态推理任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: Tiny-R1V通过创新的两阶段优化方法，成功解决了轻量级多模态大语言模型在推理效率和准确性方面的挑战，为轻量级模型在多模态推理任务中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, they encounter numerous
challenges in terms of reasoning efficiency, such as large model size,
overthinking, and compromised accuracy in lightweight scenarios. However,
research on the reasoning capabilities of lightweight MLLMs is quite lacking.
To this end, we propose Tiny-R1V, a novel lightweight 3B model that achieves
faster inference and higher accuracy via a two-stage optimization, while
unifying multimodal reasoning across multiple tasks and using fewer tokens. In
the first stage, Tiny-R1V introduces Length-Informed Relative Policy
Optimization (LIPO), a novel reinforcement learning method, to train each
reasoning model. The LIPO is designed to dynamically adjusts advantages of
responses within groups, that is, by prioritizing concise yet high-quality
responses to encourage the generation of shorter and more accurate response. In
the second stage, we propose Adaptive Model Merging (AMM), a training-free
model merging method that merges multiple specialist models into a unified
architecture. Specifically, AMM adaptively adjusts the weights of task vectors
and robustly optimizes the merged vectors via a novel gradient projection
regularization loss function, thus mitigating redundant conflicts between them.
Extensive evaluations on ten widely-used reasoning benchmarks covering
mathematics, structured data (charts, tables, documents), OCR, and general
capabilities showcase the superior performance of Tiny-R1V, enabling
lightweight models to excel in diverse multimodal reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准在评估LLMs的旅行规划能力时，往往无法充分评估计划的可行性、可靠性和吸引力，需要更全面的评估框架。

Method: 构建包含4,870个查询的大规模数据集，开发统一奖励评估器，比较多种方法包括测试时计算、神经符号方法、监督微调和GRPO强化学习。

Result: 评估器与旅行专家标注达到60.75%的一致性，优于多个LLM-as-judge基线；RL方法在基础模型上普遍提高了行程可行性，获得更高的统一奖励分数。

Conclusion: 提出的基准能够有效评估旅行规划质量，RL方法在提高计划可行性方面表现优异，为LLMs的旅行规划能力提供了更好的评估框架。

Abstract: Travel planning is a valuable yet complex task that poses significant
challenges even for advanced large language models (LLMs). While recent
benchmarks have advanced in evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities, they often
fall short in evaluating feasibility, reliability, and engagement of travel
plans. We introduce a comprehensive benchmark for travel planning that unifies
fine-grained criteria into a single reward, enabling direct comparison of plan
quality and seamless integration with reinforcement learning (RL). Our
evaluator achieves moderate agreement with travel-expert annotations (60.75\%)
and outperforms multiple LLM-as-judge baselines. We further release a
large-scale dataset of 4,870 queries including 219 real-world, free-form
requests for generalization to authentic user intent. Using this benchmark, we
conduct extensive experiments across diverse methods and LLMs, including
test-time computation, neuro-symbolic approaches, supervised fine-tuning, and
RL via GRPO. Across base models, RL generally improves itinerary feasibility
over prompt-only and supervised baselines, yielding higher unified reward
scores.

Method: 使用90个Gemini 2.5 Pro生成的证明解决方案（1-4分制）和MathArena的IMO/USAMO 2025解决方案（0-7分制）进行分析，引入代理工作流来提取参考解并自动生成问题特定的评分标准。

Result: 模型能可靠标记错误（包括细微错误）解决方案，但在部分分数分配上存在校准差距。提出的工作流在人工评分一致性和部分分数处理一致性方面表现更好。

Conclusion: 代理工作流能有效改进LLMs的证明评分能力，实现更高的人工评分一致性和更一致的部分分数处理，为未来研究提供了代码、数据和提示/日志资源。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs have progressed from struggling on proof-based
Olympiad problems to solving most of the IMO 2025 problems, with leading
systems reportedly handling 5 of 6 problems. Given this progress, we assess how
well these models can grade proofs: detecting errors, judging their severity,
and assigning fair scores beyond binary correctness. We study proof-analysis
capabilities using a corpus of 90 Gemini 2.5 Pro-generated solutions that we
grade on a 1-4 scale with detailed error annotations, and on MathArena solution
sets for IMO/USAMO 2025 scored on a 0-7 scale. Our analysis shows that models
can reliably flag incorrect (including subtly incorrect) solutions but exhibit
calibration gaps in how partial credit is assigned. To address this, we
introduce agentic workflows that extract and analyze reference solutions and
automatically derive problem-specific rubrics for a multi-step grading process.
We instantiate and compare different design choices for the grading workflows,
and evaluate their trade-offs. Across our annotated corpus and MathArena, our
proposed workflows achieve higher agreement with human grades and more
consistent handling of partial credit across metrics. We release all code,
data, and prompts/logs to facilitate future research.

*Sicheol Sung,Joonghyuk Hahn,Yo-Sub Han*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合框架LRR，结合符号分析和LLM来修复正则表达式拒绝服务漏洞，在保持语义正确性的同时提高修复率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有正则表达式修复方法存在权衡：符号方法精确但无法处理复杂模式，LLM方法通用但缺乏可靠性。需要结合两者优势来解决ReDoS漏洞修复问题

Method: 采用混合框架：先用符号模块定位易受攻击的子模式，再用LLM生成该隔离片段的语义等价修复

Result: 成功解决了规则修复方法无法处理的复杂案例，同时避免了纯LLM方法的语义错误，修复率比最先进方法提高了15.4%

Conclusion: LRR框架为自动修复问题提供了经过验证的方法论，通过解耦问题识别和修复过程，在保持可靠性的同时充分利用了LLM的泛化能力

Abstract: Regular expressions (regexes) are foundational to modern computing for
critical tasks like input validation and data parsing, yet their ubiquity
exposes systems to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS), a
vulnerability requiring automated repair methods. Current approaches, however,
are hampered by a trade-off. Symbolic, rule-based system are precise but fails
to repair unseen or complex vulnerability patterns. Conversely, large language
models (LLMs) possess the necessary generalizability but are unreliable for
tasks demanding strict syntactic and semantic correctness. We resolve this
impasse by introducing a hybrid framework, localized regex repair (LRR),
designed to harness LLM generalization while enforcing reliability. Our core
insight is to decouple problem identification from the repair process. First, a
deterministic, symbolic module localizes the precise vulnerable subpattern,
creating a constrained and tractable problem space. Then, the LLM invoked to
generate a semantically equivalent fix for this isolated segment. This combined
architecture successfully resolves complex repair cases intractable for
rule-based repair while avoiding the semantic errors of LLM-only approaches.
Our work provides a validated methodology for solving such problems in
automated repair, improving the repair rate by 15.4%p over the
state-of-the-art. Our code is available at https://github.com/cdltlehf/LRR.

*Wenyi Wu,Kun Zhou,Ruoxin Yuan,Vivian Yu,Stephen Wang,Zhiting Hu,Biwei Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出连续记忆机制，将GUI轨迹编码为固定长度的连续嵌入，显著降低上下文成本并保留细粒度视觉信息，通过自动扩展数据飞轮收集10万+轨迹，在真实GUI基准测试中提升长视野和分布偏移下的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI代理将过去轨迹压缩为文本标记，导致上下文长度膨胀且丢失关键视觉线索（如精确的控件大小和位置），需要可扩展的记忆机制来泛化到不熟悉的界面和长视野任务。

Method: 使用VLM作为编码器将GUI轨迹编码为固定长度的连续嵌入序列，直接插入主干网络的输入层；引入自动扩展数据飞轮，通过搜索发现新环境、使用开源VLM合成任务、代理执行轨迹、同一VLM验证成功来低成本扩展记忆。

Result: 随着记忆大小和检索深度的增加，性能单调提升，而文本记忆在长提示下会退化；在真实GUI基准测试中，记忆增强代理在长视野和分布偏移下持续提高成功率；Qwen-2.5-VL-7B + 连续记忆达到与最先进闭源模型（如GPT-4o、Claude-4）相当的性能。

Conclusion: 连续记忆机制有效解决了GUI代理中的上下文成本问题和视觉信息丢失问题，通过低成本数据收集和微调实现了与顶级闭源模型竞争的性能，为GUI代理的可扩展记忆提供了可行方案。

Abstract: We study how to endow GUI agents with scalable memory that help generalize
across unfamiliar interfaces and long-horizon tasks. Prior GUI agents compress
past trajectories into text tokens, which balloons context length and misses
decisive visual cues (e.g., exact widget size and position). We propose a
continuous memory that encodes each GUI trajectory into a fixed-length sequence
of continuous embeddings using the VLM itself as an encoder; these embeddings
are plugged directly into the backbone's input layer, sharply reducing context
cost while preserving fine-grained visual information. As memory size and
retrieval depth increase, performance improves monotonically, unlike text
memories that degrade with long prompts. To grow memory at low cost, we
introduce an auto-scaling data flywheel that (i) discovers new environments via
search, (ii) synthesizes tasks with an open-source VLM, (iii) rolls out
trajectories with the agent, and (iv) verifies success with the same VLM. Using
this pipeline, we collect 100k+ trajectories for about \$4000 and fine-tune
only the memory encoder (LoRA on a Q-Former, 1.2\% parameters) with 1,500
samples. On real-world GUI benchmarks, our memory-augmented agent consistently
improves success rates under long horizons and distribution shifts. Notably,
Qwen-2.5-VL-7B + continuous memory achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude-4).

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究通过整合精神分析和MBTI人格理论，构建了包含自我意识、潜意识和前意识的人工意识模块，以及16种MBTI人格角色，来模拟人类意识认知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在模仿人类意识方面存在局限性，特别是幻觉问题。研究旨在通过心理学理论构建更接近人类认知的人工意识系统。

Method: 基于精神分析理论开发三种人工意识模块，设计16种MBTI人格角色，创建10种不同情境测试模型的认知能力，并通过调查评估、ChatGPT分类和定性分析三种方式进行评估。

Result: 定量和定性分析表明模型能较好地模拟人类意识，但不同角色和意识类型之间的响应差异不显著。

Conclusion: 整合精神分析和人格理论的模型能够构建更直观、适应性更强的人工意识系统，为复杂认知情境下的AI交互开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Human consciousness is still a concept hard to define with current scientific
understanding. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated
significant advancements across various domains including translation and
summarization, human consciousness is not something to imitate with current
upfront technology owing to so-called hallucination. This study, therefore,
proposes a novel approach to address these challenges by integrating
psychoanalysis and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) into constructing
consciousness and personality modules. We developed three artificial
consciousnesses (self-awareness, unconsciousness, and preconsciousness) based
on the principles of psychoanalysis. Additionally, we designed 16 characters
with different personalities representing the sixteen MBTI types, with several
attributes such as needs, status, and memories. To determine if our model's
artificial consciousness exhibits human-like cognition, we created ten distinct
situations considering seven attributes such as emotional understanding and
logical thinking. The decision-making process of artificial consciousness and
the final action were evaluated in three ways: survey evaluation, three-tier
classification via ChatGPT, and qualitative review. Both quantitative and
qualitative analyses indicated a high likelihood of well-simulated
consciousness, although the difference in response between different characters
and consciousnesses was not very significant. This implies that the developed
models incorporating elements of psychoanalysis and personality theory can lead
to building a more intuitive and adaptable AI system with humanoid
consciousness. Therefore, this study contributes to opening up new avenues for
improving AI interactions in complex cognitive contexts.

TL;DR: 提出了MEC³O系统，一个基于多专家共识的代码时间复杂度预测方法，通过将LLMs分配到不同复杂度类别并让专家进行结构化辩论，显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs在代码时间复杂度预测中表现不稳定，不同模型在不同复杂度类别上各有优势，但没有单一模型在所有类别上都表现优异。

Method: MEC³O系统将LLMs分配到特定复杂度类别，提供类别专用指令使其成为专家，然后进行结构化辩论，通过加权共识机制整合预测结果。

Result: 在CodeComplex数据集上，MEC³O比开源基线方法准确率和macro-F1分数至少高出10%，在macro-F1上平均超过GPT-4o-mini，与GPT-4o和GPT-4o-mini的F1分数相当。

Conclusion: 多专家辩论和加权共识策略能有效提升代码时间复杂度预测性能，证明了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Predicting the complexity of source code is essential for software
development and algorithm analysis. Recently, Baik et al. (2025) introduced
CodeComplex for code time complexity prediction. The paper shows that LLMs
without fine-tuning struggle with certain complexity classes. This suggests
that no single LLM excels at every class, but rather each model shows
advantages in certain classes. We propose MEC$^3$O, a multi-expert consensus
system, which extends the multi-agent debate frameworks. MEC$^3$O assigns LLMs
to complexity classes based on their performance and provides them with
class-specialized instructions, turning them into experts. These experts engage
in structured debates, and their predictions are integrated through a weighted
consensus mechanism. Our expertise assignments to LLMs effectively handle
Degeneration-of-Thought, reducing reliance on a separate judge model, and
preventing convergence to incorrect majority opinions. Experiments on
CodeComplex show that MEC$^3$O outperforms the open-source baselines, achieving
at least 10% higher accuracy and macro-F1 scores. It also surpasses GPT-4o-mini
in macro-F1 scores on average and demonstrates competitive on-par F1 scores to
GPT-4o and GPT-o4-mini on average. This demonstrates the effectiveness of
multi-expert debates and weight consensus strategy to generate the final
predictions. Our code and data is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练、在推理时控制流式文本到图像模型的方法，通过特征空间目标和正交随机扰动来增强生成多样性，同时保持图像质量和提示对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流式文本到图像模型遵循确定性轨迹，用户需要重复采样来发现多样模式，这个过程成本高且效率低。

Method: 使用特征空间目标鼓励轨迹间的横向扩展，并通过时间调度的随机扰动重新引入不确定性，该扰动被投影为与生成流正交，以在不降低图像细节或提示保真度的情况下增强变化。

Result: 在固定采样预算下，该方法在多个文本到图像设置中持续改进多样性指标（如Vendi Score和Brisque），同时保持图像质量和对齐。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种原则性的解释，说明为何生成质量能够稳健保持，同时有效提升生成多样性。

Abstract: Flow-based text-to-image models follow deterministic trajectories, forcing
users to repeatedly sample to discover diverse modes, which is a costly and
inefficient process. We present a training-free, inference-time control
mechanism that makes the flow itself diversity-aware. Our method simultaneously
encourages lateral spread among trajectories via a feature-space objective and
reintroduces uncertainty through a time-scheduled stochastic perturbation.
Crucially, this perturbation is projected to be orthogonal to the generation
flow, a geometric constraint that allows it to boost variation without
degrading image details or prompt fidelity. Our procedure requires no
retraining or modification to the base sampler and is compatible with common
flow-matching solvers. Theoretically, our method is shown to monotonically
increase a volume surrogate while, due to its geometric constraints,
approximately preserving the marginal distribution. This provides a principled
explanation for why generation quality is robustly maintained. Empirically,
across multiple text-to-image settings under fixed sampling budgets, our method
consistently improves diversity metrics such as the Vendi Score and Brisque
over strong baselines, while upholding image quality and alignment.

Method: 引入动态超图学习捕捉复杂网络中的高阶非成对关系；提出物理数据双驱动动态预测模块，结合Koopman算子理论将非线性动力学微分方程转化为线性系统求解，并利用物理信息神经微分方程方法确保动态演化符合物理规律。

Conclusion: 该方法通过动态超图学习和物理数据双驱动预测模块，有效解决了复杂网络动态预测中的高阶关系捕捉和模型可解释性问题，实现了准确且可解释的长期动态预测。

Abstract: Learning complex network dynamics is fundamental to understanding, modelling
and controlling real-world complex systems. There are two main problems in the
task of predicting the dynamic evolution of complex networks: on the one hand,
existing methods usually use simple graphs to describe the relationships in
complex networks; however, this approach can only capture pairwise
relationships, while there may be rich non-pairwise structured relationships in
the network. First-order GNNs have difficulty in capturing dynamic non-pairwise
relationships. On the other hand, theoretical prediction models lack accuracy
and data-driven prediction models lack interpretability. To address the above
problems, this paper proposes a higher-order network dynamics identification
method for long-term dynamic prediction of complex networks. Firstly, to
address the problem that traditional graph machine learning can only deal with
pairwise relations, dynamic hypergraph learning is introduced to capture the
higher-order non-pairwise relations among complex networks and improve the
accuracy of complex network modelling. Then, a dual-driven dynamic prediction
module for physical data is proposed. The Koopman operator theory is introduced
to transform the nonlinear dynamical differential equations for the dynamic
evolution of complex networks into linear systems for solving. Meanwhile, the
physical information neural differential equation method is utilised to ensure
that the dynamic evolution conforms to the physical laws. The dual-drive
dynamic prediction module ensures both accuracy and interpretability of the
prediction. Validated on public datasets and self-built industrial chain
network datasets, the experimental results show that the method in this paper
has good prediction accuracy and long-term prediction performance.

Motivation: 现有大型语言模型代理在社交推理游戏中主要关注信息处理和策略选择，忽视了说服性沟通在影响其他玩家信念和反应方面的重要性。

Method: 将回合制对话形式化为Stackelberg竞争，当前玩家作为领导者战略性地影响跟随者的响应，并提出了一个强化学习框架来训练代理优化说服性话语。

Result: 在三个不同的社交推理游戏中进行全面实验，证明所提出的代理显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了开发具有战略性社会影响力AI代理的重要进展，对需要说服性沟通的场景具有广泛意义。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have shown remarkable progress in social
deduction games (SDGs). However, existing approaches primarily focus on
information processing and strategy selection, overlooking the significance of
persuasive communication in influencing other players' beliefs and responses.
In SDGs, success depends not only on making correct deductions but on
convincing others to response in alignment with one's intent. To address this
limitation, we formalize turn-based dialogue in SDGs as a Stackelberg
competition, where the current player acts as the leader who strategically
influences the follower's response. Building on this theoretical foundation, we
propose a reinforcement learning framework that trains agents to optimize
utterances for persuasive impact. Through comprehensive experiments across
three diverse SDGs, we demonstrate that our agents significantly outperform
baselines. This work represents a significant step toward developing AI agents
capable of strategic social influence, with implications extending to scenarios
requiring persuasive communication.

Conclusion: PAC推理方法为大型推理模型提供了统计保证的高效推理方案，能在保证性能的前提下显著降低计算成本。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable progress in complex
problem-solving tasks. Despite this success, LRMs typically suffer from high
computational costs during deployment, highlighting a need for efficient
inference. A popular direction of efficiency improvement is to switch the LRM
between thinking and nonthinking modes dynamically. However, such approaches
often introduce additional reasoning errors and lack statistical guarantees for
the performance loss, which are critical for high-stakes applications. In this
work, we propose Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) reasoning that controls
the performance loss under the user-specified performance loss tolerance. In
particular, we construct an upper confidence bound on the performance loss,
formulated as a monotone function of the uncertainty score, and subsequently
determine a threshold for switching to the nonthinking model. Theoretically,
using the threshold to switch between the thinking and nonthinking modes
ensures bounded performance loss in a distribution-free manner. Our
comprehensive experiments on reasoning benchmarks show that the proposed method
can save computational budgets and control the user-specified performance loss.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在医疗领域的广泛应用，需要评估其是否存在社会偏见，特别是对不同社会群体（性别、年龄、种族）的医疗建议是否存在差异。

Method: 通过模拟不同患者档案（性别、年龄、种族）向LLMs提出一系列医疗问题，比较生成回答的自然语言特征。

Result: LLMs生成的医疗建议在不同社会群体间存在系统性差异，原住民和双性人患者收到的建议可读性更差、更复杂，交叉性群体中这种差异更加明显。

Conclusion: 鉴于用户对LLMs的信任度增加，需要提高AI素养，并呼吁AI开发者紧急调查和缓解这些系统性差异，确保公平的患者支持。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), the general public
now has easy and affordable access to applications capable of answering most
health-related questions in a personalized manner. These LLMs are increasingly
proving to be competitive, and now even surpass professionals in some medical
capabilities. They hold particular promise in low-resource settings,
considering they provide the possibility of widely accessible, quasi-free
healthcare support. However, evaluations that fuel these motivations highly
lack insights into the social nature of healthcare, oblivious to health
disparities between social groups and to how bias may translate into
LLM-generated medical advice and impact users. We provide an exploratory
analysis of LLM answers to a series of medical questions spanning key clinical
domains, where we simulate these questions being asked by several patient
profiles that vary in sex, age range, and ethnicity. By comparing natural
language features of the generated responses, we show that, when LLMs are used
for medical advice generation, they generate responses that systematically
differ between social groups. In particular, Indigenous and intersex patients
receive advice that is less readable and more complex. We observe these trends
amplify when intersectional groups are considered. Considering the increasing
trust individuals place in these models, we argue for higher AI literacy and
for the urgent need for investigation and mitigation by AI developers to ensure
these systemic differences are diminished and do not translate to unjust
patient support. Our code is publicly available on GitHub.

Abstract: In the field of medicine and healthcare, the utilization of medical
expertise, based on medical knowledge combined with patients' health
information is a life-critical challenge for patients and health professionals.
The within-laying complexity and variety form the need for a united approach to
gather, analyze, and utilize existing knowledge of medical treatments, and
medical operations to provide the ability to present knowledge for the means of
accurate patient-driven decision-making. One way to achieve this is the fusion
of multiple knowledge sources in healthcare. It provides health professionals
the opportunity to select from multiple contextual aligned knowledge sources
which enables the support for critical decisions. This paper presents multiple
conceptual models for knowledge fusion in the field of medicine, based on a
knowledge graph structure. It will evaluate, how knowledge fusion can be
enabled and presents how to integrate various knowledge sources into the
knowledge graph for rescue operations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型和推理模型在计算限制方面，特别是受有限上下文窗口约束的空间复杂性，仍缺乏深入理解。现有研究多关注NP复杂度问题，需要更严格的PSPACE完全问题来评估计算能力。

Method: 通过双指数空间探索构建了包含超过100万个正则表达式实例的标注数据集，设计了基于两个PSPACE完全正则表达式问题（等价性判定RegexEQ和最小化RegexMin）的基准测试。

Result: 对6个LLM和5个LRM的广泛评估显示，模型在处理PSPACE完全问题时存在常见失败模式，如冗长性和重复性，揭示了其空间计算限制。

Conclusion: 这项工作首次对LLM和LRM的空间计算限制进行了实证研究，为评估其高级推理能力提供了新框架，基准代码已开源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show strong performance across natural language
processing (NLP), mathematical reasoning, and programming, and recent large
reasoning models (LRMs) further emphasize explicit reasoning. Yet their
computational limits, particularly spatial complexity constrained by finite
context windows, remain poorly understood. While recent works often focus on
problems within the NP complexity class, we push the boundary by introducing a
novel benchmark grounded in two PSPACE-complete regular expression (regex)
problems: equivalence decision (RegexEQ) and minimization (RegexMin).
PSPACE-complete problems serve as a more rigorous standard for assessing
computational capacity, as their solutions require massive search space
exploration. We perform a double-exponential space exploration to construct a
labeled dataset of over a million regex instances with a sound filtering
process to build the benchmark. We conduct extensive evaluations on 6 LLMs and
5 LRMs of varying scales, revealing common failure patterns such as verbosity
and repetition. With its well-defined structure and quantitative evaluation
metrics, this work presents the first empirical investigation into the spatial
computational limitations of LLMs and LRMs, offering a new framework for
evaluating their advanced reasoning capabilities. Our code is available at

Abstract: This paper reviews the architecture and implementation methods of agents
powered by large language models (LLMs). Motivated by the limitations of
traditional LLMs in real-world tasks, the research aims to explore patterns to
develop "agentic" LLMs that can automate complex tasks and bridge the
performance gap with human capabilities. Key components include a perception
system that converts environmental percepts into meaningful representations; a
reasoning system that formulates plans, adapts to feedback, and evaluates
actions through different techniques like Chain-of-Thought and Tree-of-Thought;
a memory system that retains knowledge through both short-term and long-term
mechanisms; and an execution system that translates internal decisions into
concrete actions. This paper shows how integrating these systems leads to more
capable and generalized software bots that mimic human cognitive processes for
autonomous and intelligent behavior.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的框架，通过可调节的局部性拨盘参数，使大语言模型能够在局部化（可解释、基于规则）和分布式（泛化性强、高效）编码之间连续调整内部表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决大语言模型在需要透明性和高性能的受监管领域中，难以同时满足可解释性和性能需求的矛盾。

Method: 采用组稀疏惩罚注意力机制、信息论锚点设计和动态规则注入，通过数学证明建立了注意力集中在语义相关块上的显式阈值条件。

Result: 当组稀疏惩罚超过特定阈值时，模型的注意力机制会集中在语义相关块上，实现低熵和高保真度，误差可忽略不计。

Conclusion: 该框架使从业者能够在可解释模式和高性能模式之间连续插值，支持需要透明性和能力的受监管领域应用。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for training large language models with
continuously adjustable internal representations that span the full spectrum
from localist (interpretable, rule-based) to distributed (generalizable,
efficient) encodings. The key innovation is a locality dial, a tunable
parameter that dynamically controls the degree of localization during both
training and inference without requiring model retraining. This is achieved
through group sparsity penalties on attention mechanisms, information-theoretic
anchor design, and dynamic rule injection. We provide rigorous mathematical
proofs establishing explicit threshold conditions under which attention
provably concentrates on semantically relevant blocks, with exponential bounds
on attention entropy and pointer fidelity. Specifically, we prove that when
group sparsity penalties exceed certain threshold values, the model's attention
mechanisms concentrate on semantically relevant blocks, achieving low entropy
and high fidelity with negligible error. This framework enables practitioners
to continuously interpolate between interpretable and high-performance modes,
supporting applications in regulated domains requiring both transparency and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在逻辑推理任务中的内部机制，理解模型如何实现演绎推理而非仅作为统计学习器。

Method: 使用小型语言模型解决演绎推理任务，分析其内部表示和计算电路，特别关注归纳头的作用。

Result: 发现归纳头在规则补全和规则链式推理步骤中发挥核心作用，是实现逻辑推理的关键机制。

Conclusion: 语言模型能够通过学习底层规则来实现逻辑推理，归纳头是实现这一能力的重要组件，为理解模型推理机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Recent large language models have demonstrated relevant capabilities in
solving problems that require logical reasoning; however, the corresponding
internal mechanisms remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we show that a
small language model can solve a deductive reasoning task by learning the
underlying rules (rather than operating as a statistical learner). A low-level
explanation of its internal representations and computational circuits is then
provided. Our findings reveal that induction heads play a central role in the
implementation of the rule completion and rule chaining steps involved in the
logical inference required by the task.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了序列变量作为约束编程中处理车辆路径问题的新方法，能够处理可选访问点并支持插入启发式算法，相比传统的后继变量模型更具优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统约束编程中基于后继变量的模型无法有效处理可选访问点或插入式启发式算法，这限制了在车辆路径问题中的应用。

Method: 形式化定义了序列变量的计算域、更新操作和一致性级别，实现了底层数据结构，并设计了专门用于序列变量和车辆路径的全局约束。

Result: 序列变量简化了问题建模，并在Dial-a-Ride问题上实现了具有竞争力的计算性能。

Conclusion: 序列变量为约束编程中的车辆路径问题提供了更直观、声明性的建模框架，能够有效处理可选访问点和插入启发式算法。

Abstract: Constraint Programming (CP) offers an intuitive, declarative framework for
modeling Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP), yet classical CP models based on
successor variables cannot always deal with optional visits or insertion based
heuristics. To address these limitations, this paper formalizes sequence
variables within CP. Unlike the classical successor models, this computational
domain handle optional visits and support insertion heuristics, including
insertion-based Large Neighborhood Search. We provide a clear definition of
their domain, update operations, and introduce consistency levels for
constraints on this domain. An implementation is described with the underlying
data structures required for integrating sequence variables into existing
trail-based CP solvers. Furthermore, global constraints specifically designed
for sequence variables and vehicle routing are introduced. Finally, the
effectiveness of sequence variables is demonstrated by simplifying problem
modeling and achieving competitive computational performance on the Dial-a-Ride
Problem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射学具有多模态数据流和协调工作流程的特点，非常适合利用能够适应上下文并自动化复杂重复任务的智能代理。虽然LLMs在放射学的单个任务中已表现出色，但孤立使用未能充分发挥其在复杂多步骤工作流程中的潜力。

Result: LLM驱动的代理系统在放射学中显示出处理复杂多步骤工作流程的潜力，能够整合多源信息并根据演化上下文做出决策。

Conclusion: 该综述系统分析了LLM驱动代理系统的设计、关键应用、评估方法，并指出了错误级联、工具使用效率和医疗IT集成等挑战，为放射学中智能代理的发展提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Building agents, systems that perceive and act upon their environment with a
degree of autonomy, has long been a focus of AI research. This pursuit has
recently become vastly more practical with the emergence of large language
models (LLMs) capable of using natural language to integrate information,
follow instructions, and perform forms of "reasoning" and planning across a
wide range of tasks. With its multimodal data streams and orchestrated
workflows spanning multiple systems, radiology is uniquely suited to benefit
from agents that can adapt to context and automate repetitive yet complex
tasks. In radiology, LLMs and their multimodal variants have already
demonstrated promising performance for individual tasks such as information
extraction and report summarization. However, using LLMs in isolation
underutilizes their potential to support complex, multi-step workflows where
decisions depend on evolving context from multiple information sources.
Equipping LLMs with external tools and feedback mechanisms enables them to
drive systems that exhibit a spectrum of autonomy, ranging from semi-automated
workflows to more adaptive agents capable of managing complex processes. This
review examines the design of such LLM-driven agentic systems, highlights key
applications, discusses evaluation methods for planning and tool use, and
outlines challenges such as error cascades, tool-use efficiency, and health IT
integration.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 对Google Titans模型进行了轻量级重新实现和评估，发现其神经记忆组件能持续提升性能，但由于分块处理并不总是优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Google Titans模型缺乏公开代码且原始描述存在模糊性，阻碍了可复现性研究。

Method: 开发了Titans的轻量级重新实现，并在掩码语言建模、时间序列预测和推荐任务上进行了全面评估。

Result: Titans并不总是优于现有基线（由于分块处理），但其神经记忆组件相比仅使用注意力的模型能持续提升性能。

Conclusion: 确认了该模型的创新潜力，同时指出了实际局限性，并为未来研究提出了问题。

Abstract: By the end of 2024, Google researchers introduced Titans: Learning at Test
Time, a neural memory model achieving strong empirical results across multiple
tasks. However, the lack of publicly available code and ambiguities in the
original description hinder reproducibility. In this work, we present a
lightweight reimplementation of Titans and conduct a comprehensive evaluation
on Masked Language Modeling, Time Series Forecasting, and Recommendation tasks.
Our results reveal that Titans does not always outperform established baselines
due to chunking. However, its Neural Memory component consistently improves
performance compared to attention-only models. These findings confirm the
model's innovative potential while highlighting its practical limitations and
raising questions for future research.

*Jacopo Tagliabue,Ciro Greco*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出API优先、可编程的数据湖仓为AI驱动的自动化工作流提供了安全设计的基础设施，通过数据分支和声明式环境实现不可信AI代理在生产数据上的安全操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据湖仓运行敏感工作负载，AI驱动的自动化引发了关于信任、正确性和治理的担忧，需要安全的设计方法来支持代理工作流。

Method: 使用Bauplan作为案例研究，展示数据分支和声明式环境如何自然扩展到代理，通过受证明携带代码启发的正确性检查来修复数据管道。

Result: 原型演示表明不可信的AI代理可以在生产数据上安全操作，并展示了实现完全代理化湖仓的路径。

Conclusion: API优先、可编程的湖仓为安全设计的代理工作流提供了正确的抽象，通过数据分支和声明式环境实现可重现性和可观测性，同时减少攻击面。

Abstract: Data lakehouses run sensitive workloads, where AI-driven automation raises
concerns about trust, correctness, and governance. We argue that API-first,
programmable lakehouses provide the right abstractions for safe-by-design,
agentic workflows. Using Bauplan as a case study, we show how data branching
and declarative environments extend naturally to agents, enabling
reproducibility and observability while reducing the attack surface. We present
a proof-of-concept in which agents repair data pipelines using correctness
checks inspired by proof-carrying code. Our prototype demonstrates that
untrusted AI agents can operate safely on production data and outlines a path
toward a fully agentic lakehouse.

### [167] [GraphMERT: Efficient and Scalable Distillation of Reliable Knowledge Graphs from Unstructured Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09580)
*Margarita Belova,Jiaxin Xiao,Shikhar Tuli,Niraj K. Jha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GraphMERT是一个小型图形编码器模型，通过从非结构化文本语料库中提取高质量知识图谱来解决神经符号AI的可扩展性和可解释性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经符号AI领域近三十年来未能实现其潜力，主要因为现有框架难以扩展，且神经方法的隐式表示和近似推理限制了可解释性和可信度。知识图谱作为显式语义知识的黄金标准表示可以解决符号方面的问题，但从文本语料库自动推导可靠知识图谱仍是一个开放问题。

Method: 引入GraphMERT，一个微型图形编码器模型，从非结构化文本语料库及其内部表示中提取高质量知识图谱。GraphMERT及其等效知识图谱形成一个模块化神经符号堆栈：神经学习抽象；符号知识图谱用于可验证推理。

Result: 在PubMed糖尿病论文文本上，80M参数的GraphMERT生成的知识图谱达到69.8%的FActScore，而32B参数的基线LLM仅达到40.2%。GraphMERT知识图谱的有效性得分为68.8%，而LLM基线为43.0%。

Conclusion: GraphMERT + KG是第一个高效且可扩展的神经符号模型，在实现最先进基准精度的同时，相对于基线具有优越的符号表示能力。

Abstract: Researchers have pursued neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (AI)
applications for nearly three decades because symbolic components provide
abstraction while neural components provide generalization. Thus, a marriage of
the two components can lead to rapid advancements in AI. Yet, the field has not
realized this promise since most neurosymbolic AI frameworks fail to scale. In
addition, the implicit representations and approximate reasoning of neural
approaches limit interpretability and trust. Knowledge graphs (KGs), a
gold-standard representation of explicit semantic knowledge, can address the
symbolic side. However, automatically deriving reliable KGs from text corpora
has remained an open problem. We address these challenges by introducing
GraphMERT, a tiny graphical encoder-only model that distills high-quality KGs
from unstructured text corpora and its own internal representations. GraphMERT
and its equivalent KG form a modular neurosymbolic stack: neural learning of
abstractions; symbolic KGs for verifiable reasoning. GraphMERT + KG is the
first efficient and scalable neurosymbolic model to achieve state-of-the-art
benchmark accuracy along with superior symbolic representations relative to
baselines.
  Concretely, we target reliable domain-specific KGs that are both (1) factual
(with provenance) and (2) valid (ontology-consistent relations with
domain-appropriate semantics). When a large language model (LLM), e.g.,
Qwen3-32B, generates domain-specific KGs, it falls short on reliability due to
prompt sensitivity, shallow domain expertise, and hallucinated relations. On
text obtained from PubMed papers on diabetes, our 80M-parameter GraphMERT
yields a KG with a 69.8% FActScore; a 32B-parameter baseline LLM yields a KG
that achieves only 40.2% FActScore. The GraphMERT KG also attains a higher
ValidityScore of 68.8%, versus 43.0% for the LLM baseline.

### [168] [LiveOIBench: Can Large Language Models Outperform Human Contestants in Informatics Olympiads?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09595)
*Kaijian Zou,Aaron Xiong,Yunxiang Zhang,Frederick Zhang,Yueqi Ren,Jirong Yang,Ayoung Lee,Shitanshu Bhushan,Lu Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LiveOIBench是一个包含403个奥林匹克级别编程竞赛题目的基准测试，每个题目平均有60个专家设计的测试用例，用于评估大语言模型的编程能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前编程基准测试存在缺乏高难度问题、测试用例覆盖不足、依赖在线平台API等问题，需要更全面的评估工具。

Method: 从72个官方信息学奥林匹克竞赛中收集403个专家策划的高质量题目，每个题目配备详细子任务评分标准和大量私有测试用例，并集成精英选手表现数据进行对比。

Result: GPT-5达到81.76百分位数，表现强劲但仍不及顶尖人类选手（通常超过90百分位数）；开源推理模型GPT-OSS-120B仅达60百分位数，与前沿闭源模型存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 强大的推理模型应优先进行精确的问题分析而非过度探索，未来模型应强调结构化分析并减少不必要的探索。

Abstract: Competitive programming problems increasingly serve as valuable benchmarks to
evaluate the coding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) due to their
complexity and ease of verification. Yet, current coding benchmarks face
limitations such as lack of exceptionally challenging problems, insufficient
test case coverage, reliance on online platform APIs that limit accessibility.
To address these issues, we introduce LiveOIBench, a comprehensive benchmark
featuring 403 expert-curated Olympiad-level competitive programming problems,
each with an average of 60 expert-designed test cases. The problems are sourced
directly from 72 official Informatics Olympiads in different regions conducted
between 2023 and 2025. LiveOIBench distinguishes itself through four key
features: (1) meticulously curated high-quality tasks with detailed subtask
rubrics and extensive private test cases; (2) direct integration of elite
contestant performance data to enable informative comparison against
top-performing humans; (3) planned continuous, contamination-free updates from
newly released Olympiad problems; and (4) a self-contained evaluation system
facilitating offline and easy-to-reproduce assessments. Benchmarking 32 popular
general-purpose and reasoning LLMs, we find that GPT-5 achieves a notable
81.76th percentile, a strong result that nonetheless falls short of top human
contestant performance, who usually place above 90th. In contrast, among
open-weight reasoning models, GPT-OSS-120B achieves only a 60th percentile,
underscoring significant capability disparities from frontier closed models.
Detailed analyses indicate that robust reasoning models prioritize precise
problem analysis over excessive exploration, suggesting future models should
emphasize structured analysis and minimize unnecessary exploration. All data,
code, and leaderboard results will be made publicly available on our website.
