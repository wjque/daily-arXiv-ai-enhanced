TL;DR: GAZE pipeline自动将原始长视频转换为高质量的世界模型训练数据，通过AI模型进行多模态预标注，减少80%人工审核量，提升标注效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练鲁棒世界模型需要大规模精确标注的多模态数据集，但传统手动标注过程缓慢且昂贵

Method: 系统包含三个步骤：(i) 标准化360度视频格式并分片处理；(ii) 应用AI模型套件进行密集多模态预标注；(iii) 将信号整合为结构化输出规范供人工验证

Result: 效率提升显著（每审核小时节省约19分钟），人工审核量减少80%以上，通过保守自动跳过低显著性片段实现

Conclusion: 该方法生成高保真、隐私感知的数据集，可直接用于学习跨模态动态和动作条件预测，为生成高质量世界模型训练数据提供了可扩展蓝图

Abstract: Training robust world models requires large-scale, precisely labeled
multimodal datasets, a process historically bottlenecked by slow and expensive
manual annotation. We present a production-tested GAZE pipeline that automates
the conversion of raw, long-form video into rich, task-ready supervision for
world-model training. Our system (i) normalizes proprietary 360-degree formats
into standard views and shards them for parallel processing; (ii) applies a
suite of AI models (scene understanding, object tracking, audio transcription,
PII/NSFW/minor detection) for dense, multimodal pre-annotation; and (iii)
consolidates signals into a structured output specification for rapid human
validation.
  The GAZE workflow demonstrably yields efficiency gains (~19 minutes saved per
review hour) and reduces human review volume by >80% through conservative
auto-skipping of low-salience segments. By increasing label density and
consistency while integrating privacy safeguards and chain-of-custody metadata,
our method generates high-fidelity, privacy-aware datasets directly consumable
for learning cross-modal dynamics and action-conditioned prediction. We detail
our orchestration, model choices, and data dictionary to provide a scalable
blueprint for generating high-quality world model training data without
sacrificing throughput or governance.

### [2] [PC-UNet: An Enforcing Poisson Statistics U-Net for Positron Emission Tomography Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14995)
*Yang Shi,Jingchao Wang,Liangsi Lu,Mingxuan Huang,Ruixin He,Yifeng Xie,Hanqian Liu,Minzhe Guo,Yangyang Liang,Weipeng Zhang,Zimeng Li,Xuhang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PC-UNet模型和PVMC-Loss损失函数，用于解决PET图像低剂量降噪问题，通过整合物理数据提高图像保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PET临床应用中高剂量会增加辐射暴露，降低剂量会导致泊松噪声增加，现有降噪方法无法有效处理这种噪声，导致图像失真和伪影。

Method: 开发了Poisson Consistent U-Net (PC-UNet)模型，提出新的Poisson Variance and Mean Consistency Loss (PVMC-Loss)，该损失函数整合物理数据，在方差和梯度适应方面具有统计无偏性。

Result: 在PET数据集上的测试表明，PC-UNet提高了物理一致性和图像保真度，证明其有效整合物理信息的能力。

Conclusion: PC-UNet模型能够有效处理PET图像中的泊松噪声，通过物理一致性损失函数显著改善图像质量，为低剂量PET成像提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is crucial in medicine, but its clinical
use is limited due to high signal-to-noise ratio doses increasing radiation
exposure. Lowering doses increases Poisson noise, which current denoising
methods fail to handle, causing distortions and artifacts. We propose a Poisson
Consistent U-Net (PC-UNet) model with a new Poisson Variance and Mean
Consistency Loss (PVMC-Loss) that incorporates physical data to improve image
fidelity. PVMC-Loss is statistically unbiased in variance and gradient
adaptation, acting as a Generalized Method of Moments implementation, offering
robustness to minor data mismatches. Tests on PET datasets show PC-UNet
improves physical consistency and image fidelity, proving its ability to
integrate physical information effectively.

### [3] [DeLeaker: Dynamic Inference-Time Reweighting For Semantic Leakage Mitigation in Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15015)
*Mor Ventura,Michael Toker,Or Patashnik,Yonatan Belinkov,Roi Reichart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeLeaker是一种轻量级、无需优化的推理时方法，通过直接干预模型的注意力图来缓解文本到图像模型中的语义泄漏问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像模型存在语义泄漏问题，即不同实体之间意外传递语义相关特征。现有缓解策略通常基于优化或依赖外部输入。

Method: 在扩散过程中动态重新加权注意力图，抑制过度的跨实体交互，同时增强每个实体的身份特征。

Result: DeLeaker在所有基线方法中表现最佳，即使基线方法使用外部信息，也能有效缓解泄漏而不影响保真度或质量。

Conclusion: 注意力控制的价值得到验证，为开发更语义精确的文本到图像模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have advanced rapidly, yet they remain vulnerable
to semantic leakage, the unintended transfer of semantically related features
between distinct entities. Existing mitigation strategies are often
optimization-based or dependent on external inputs. We introduce DeLeaker, a
lightweight, optimization-free inference-time approach that mitigates leakage
by directly intervening on the model's attention maps. Throughout the diffusion
process, DeLeaker dynamically reweights attention maps to suppress excessive
cross-entity interactions while strengthening the identity of each entity. To
support systematic evaluation, we introduce SLIM (Semantic Leakage in IMages),
the first dataset dedicated to semantic leakage, comprising 1,130
human-verified samples spanning diverse scenarios, together with a novel
automatic evaluation framework. Experiments demonstrate that DeLeaker
consistently outperforms all baselines, even when they are provided with
external information, achieving effective leakage mitigation without
compromising fidelity or quality. These results underscore the value of
attention control and pave the way for more semantically precise T2I models.

### [4] [UrbanVerse: Scaling Urban Simulation by Watching City-Tour Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15018)
*Mingxuan Liu,Honglin He,Elisa Ricci,Wayne Wu,Bolei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UrbanVerse是一个数据驱动的真实到仿真系统，可将众包城市游览视频转换为物理感知的交互式仿真场景，包含10万+标注的3D城市资产库和自动生成管线，显著提升了城市导航AI的训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市AI代理需要多样化、高保真的城市环境进行训练，但现有仿真场景要么缺乏可扩展性，要么无法捕捉真实世界的复杂性。

Method: UrbanVerse系统包含UrbanVerse-100K（10万+标注城市3D资产库）和UrbanVerse-Gen（从视频提取场景布局并使用检索资产实例化度量尺度3D仿真的自动管线）。

Result: UrbanVerse场景保持了真实世界的语义和布局，在人类评估的真实感方面与手工制作场景相当。在城市导航中，在UrbanVerse中训练的策略表现出缩放幂律和强泛化能力，仿真中成功率提高+6.3%，零样本仿真到真实迁移中提高+30.1%。

Conclusion: UrbanVerse通过数据驱动的方法成功解决了城市AI代理训练环境的可扩展性和真实性问题，显著提升了导航性能。

Abstract: Urban embodied AI agents, ranging from delivery robots to quadrupeds, are
increasingly populating our cities, navigating chaotic streets to provide
last-mile connectivity. Training such agents requires diverse, high-fidelity
urban environments to scale, yet existing human-crafted or procedurally
generated simulation scenes either lack scalability or fail to capture
real-world complexity. We introduce UrbanVerse, a data-driven real-to-sim
system that converts crowd-sourced city-tour videos into physics-aware,
interactive simulation scenes. UrbanVerse consists of: (i) UrbanVerse-100K, a
repository of 100k+ annotated urban 3D assets with semantic and physical
attributes, and (ii) UrbanVerse-Gen, an automatic pipeline that extracts scene
layouts from video and instantiates metric-scale 3D simulations using retrieved
assets. Running in IsaacSim, UrbanVerse offers 160 high-quality constructed
scenes from 24 countries, along with a curated benchmark of 10 artist-designed
test scenes. Experiments show that UrbanVerse scenes preserve real-world
semantics and layouts, achieving human-evaluated realism comparable to manually
crafted scenes. In urban navigation, policies trained in UrbanVerse exhibit
scaling power laws and strong generalization, improving success by +6.3% in
simulation and +30.1% in zero-shot sim-to-real transfer comparing to prior
methods, accomplishing a 300 m real-world mission with only two interventions.

### [5] [NANO3D: A Training-Free Approach for Efficient 3D Editing Without Masks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15019)
*Junliang Ye,Shenghao Xie,Ruowen Zhao,Zhengyi Wang,Hongyu Yan,Wenqiang Zu,Lei Ma,Jun Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Nano3D是一个无需训练的3D物体编辑框架，通过FlowEdit和TRELLIS集成实现局部编辑，并引入Voxel/Slat-Merge策略保持结构一致性，同时构建了首个大规模3D编辑数据集Nano3D-Edit-100k。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D物体编辑方法效率低下、一致性差且难以保护未编辑区域，多视图渲染编辑方法会引入伪影，限制了实际应用。

Method: 将FlowEdit集成到TRELLIS中，通过前视图渲染指导进行局部编辑，并引入区域感知融合策略Voxel/Slat-Merge，自适应保持结构保真度。

Result: 实验表明Nano3D在3D一致性和视觉质量方面优于现有方法，并构建了包含10万+高质量3D编辑对的大规模数据集。

Conclusion: 该工作解决了算法设计和数据可用性的长期挑战，显著提高了3D编辑的通用性和可靠性，为前馈式3D编辑模型的发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: 3D object editing is essential for interactive content creation in gaming,
animation, and robotics, yet current approaches remain inefficient,
inconsistent, and often fail to preserve unedited regions. Most methods rely on
editing multi-view renderings followed by reconstruction, which introduces
artifacts and limits practicality. To address these challenges, we propose
Nano3D, a training-free framework for precise and coherent 3D object editing
without masks. Nano3D integrates FlowEdit into TRELLIS to perform localized
edits guided by front-view renderings, and further introduces region-aware
merging strategies, Voxel/Slat-Merge, which adaptively preserve structural
fidelity by ensuring consistency between edited and unedited areas. Experiments
demonstrate that Nano3D achieves superior 3D consistency and visual quality
compared with existing methods. Based on this framework, we construct the first
large-scale 3D editing datasets Nano3D-Edit-100k, which contains over 100,000
high-quality 3D editing pairs. This work addresses long-standing challenges in
both algorithm design and data availability, significantly improving the
generality and reliability of 3D editing, and laying the groundwork for the
development of feed-forward 3D editing models. Project

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了ECHO框架，通过社交媒体帖子构建图像生成模型基准测试，发现现有基准未能捕捉的新兴用例，并能更好地区分最先进模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像生成基准往往滞后于实际发展，无法捕捉新兴使用场景，导致社区认知与正式评估之间存在差距。

Method: 从展示新颖提示和用户定性判断的社交媒体帖子中构建基准数据集，针对GPT-4o Image Gen收集了31,000多个提示。

Result: ECHO发现了现有基准中缺失的创意复杂任务，能更清晰地区分最先进模型，并通过社区反馈为模型质量指标设计提供信息。

Conclusion: ECHO框架通过真实世界使用证据构建基准，能更好地反映图像生成模型的实际能力和进步。

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation, often driven by proprietary systems like
GPT-4o Image Gen, regularly introduce new capabilities that reshape how users
interact with these models. Existing benchmarks often lag behind and fail to
capture these emerging use cases, leaving a gap between community perceptions
of progress and formal evaluation. To address this, we present ECHO, a
framework for constructing benchmarks directly from real-world evidence of
model use: social media posts that showcase novel prompts and qualitative user
judgments. Applying this framework to GPT-4o Image Gen, we construct a dataset
of over 31,000 prompts curated from such posts. Our analysis shows that ECHO
(1) discovers creative and complex tasks absent from existing benchmarks, such
as re-rendering product labels across languages or generating receipts with
specified totals, (2) more clearly distinguishes state-of-the-art models from
alternatives, and (3) surfaces community feedback that we use to inform the
design of metrics for model quality (e.g., measuring observed shifts in color,
identity, and structure). Our website is at https://echo-bench.github.io.

### [7] [LoRAverse: A Submodular Framework to Retrieve Diverse Adapters for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15022)
*Mert Sonmezer,Matthew Zheng,Pinar Yanardag*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于子模块优化的方法来从大规模LoRA适配器数据库中筛选最相关且多样化的模型，解决了用户在海量LoRA模型中选择困难的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA模型虽然能够个性化预训练扩散模型，但平台上超过10万个LoRA适配器的数量庞大、多样性高且缺乏结构化组织，导致用户难以有效选择和利用最适合的适配器。

Method: 将LoRA模型选择任务构建为组合优化问题，并提出了一个新颖的子模块框架来解决这个问题。

Result: 定量和定性实验表明，该方法能够在广泛领域生成多样化的输出结果。

Conclusion: 提出的子模块优化方法有效解决了大规模LoRA适配器数据库中的选择和多样性问题。

Abstract: Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) models have revolutionized the personalization of
pre-trained diffusion models by enabling fine-tuning through low-rank,
factorized weight matrices specifically optimized for attention layers. These
models facilitate the generation of highly customized content across a variety
of objects, individuals, and artistic styles without the need for extensive
retraining. Despite the availability of over 100K LoRA adapters on platforms
like Civit.ai, users often face challenges in navigating, selecting, and
effectively utilizing the most suitable adapters due to their sheer volume,
diversity, and lack of structured organization. This paper addresses the
problem of selecting the most relevant and diverse LoRA models from this vast
database by framing the task as a combinatorial optimization problem and
proposing a novel submodular framework. Our quantitative and qualitative
experiments demonstrate that our method generates diverse outputs across a wide
range of domains.

### [8] [MOBIUS: Big-to-Mobile Universal Instance Segmentation via Multi-modal Bottleneck Fusion and Calibrated Decoder Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15026)
*Mattia Segu,Marta Tintore Gazulla,Yongqin Xian,Luc Van Gool,Federico Tombari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MOBIUS是一个用于通用实例分割的基础模型家族，通过瓶颈像素解码器、语言引导的不确定性校准损失和统一训练策略，在减少55%像素FLOPs和75%变换器解码器FLOPs的同时保持最先进性能，支持从高端加速器到移动硬件的帕累托最优部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型在实例级感知任务中表现出色，但计算成本高限制了在资源受限平台上的部署。需要设计既能保持性能又能实现高效边缘部署的架构。

Method: 提出瓶颈像素解码器用于高效多尺度和多模态融合；语言引导的不确定性校准损失用于自适应解码器剪枝；统一的训练策略简化训练流程。

Result: MOBIUS在仅需三分之一训练迭代的情况下，减少像素FLOPs达55%，变换器解码器FLOPs达75%，同时保持最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: MOBIUS为高性能计算平台和移动设备上的高效分割建立了新的基准，实现了性能与效率的帕累托最优平衡。

Abstract: Scaling up model size and training data has advanced foundation models for
instance-level perception, achieving state-of-the-art in-domain and zero-shot
performance across object detection and segmentation. However, their high
computational cost limits adoption on resource-constrained platforms. We first
examine the limitations of existing architectures in enabling efficient edge
deployment without compromising performance. We then introduce MOBIUS, a family
of foundation models for universal instance segmentation, designed for
Pareto-optimal downscaling to support deployment across devices ranging from
high-end accelerators to mobile hardware. To reduce training and inference
demands, we propose: (i) a bottleneck pixel decoder for efficient multi-scale
and multi-modal fusion, (ii) a language-guided uncertainty calibration loss for
adaptive decoder pruning, and (iii) a streamlined, unified training strategy.
Unlike efficient baselines that trade accuracy for reduced complexity, MOBIUS
reduces pixel and transformer decoder FLOPs by up to 55% and 75%, respectively,
while maintaining state-of-the-art performance in just a third of the training
iterations. MOBIUS establishes a new benchmark for efficient segmentation on
both high-performance computing platforms and mobile devices.

TL;DR: COGS框架通过分解种子问题为基本感知和推理因素，然后系统性地重新组合生成大量合成问答对，从而高效提升多模态大语言模型在缺乏标注数据领域的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在缺乏大规模人工标注推理数据的人工图像领域（如图表、渲染文档和网页）推理能力有限，需要数据高效的方法来提升其推理能力。

Method: 将每个种子问题分解为原始感知和推理因素，然后系统性地将这些因素与新图像重新组合，生成大量包含子问题和中间答案的合成问答对，支持基于因素级过程奖励的强化学习。

Result: 在图表推理任务上，COGS显著提升了模型对未见问题的性能，特别是在推理密集和组合性问题上表现最佳。因素级混合训练还能实现更好的跨数据集迁移。

Conclusion: COGS框架能够高效提升MLLMs在缺乏标注数据领域的推理能力，且具有很好的泛化性和可扩展性，可应用于图表之外的网页等其他领域。

Abstract: Pretrained multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong
performance on diverse multimodal tasks, but remain limited in reasoning
capabilities for domains where annotations are difficult to collect. In this
work, we focus on artificial image domains such as charts, rendered documents,
and webpages, which are abundant in practice yet lack large-scale human
annotated reasoning datasets. We introduce COGS (COmposition-Grounded
instruction Synthesis), a data-efficient framework for equipping MLLMs with
advanced reasoning abilities from a small set of seed questions. The key idea
is to decompose each seed question into primitive perception and reasoning
factors, which can then be systematically recomposed with new images to
generate large collections of synthetic question-answer pairs. Each generated
question is paired with subquestions and intermediate answers, enabling
reinforcement learning with factor-level process rewards. Experiments on chart
reasoning show that COGS substantially improves performance on unseen
questions, with the largest gains on reasoning-heavy and compositional
questions. Moreover, training with a factor-level mixture of different seed
data yields better transfer across multiple datasets, suggesting that COGS
induces generalizable capabilities rather than dataset-specific overfitting. We
further demonstrate that the framework extends beyond charts to other domains
such as webpages.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GDGen是一个从势能角度统一刚体、铰接体和软体动力学的框架，通过引入方向刚度来扩展经典弹性动力学，能够从简单运动观察中推断物理属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字孪生世界为开发通用具身智能体提供了新机会，但需要统一处理复杂物理行为的框架。

Method: 采用势能视角，引入方向刚度扩展弹性动力学，使用专门网络建模材料属性，用神经场表示几何无关的变形。

Result: 实验表明GDGen能稳健统一多种仿真范式，为创建交互式虚拟环境和训练机器人智能体提供多功能基础。

Conclusion: GDGen提供了一个统一框架来处理多样化物理系统，为复杂动态场景中的虚拟环境和机器人训练奠定了基础。

Abstract: Digital twin worlds with realistic interactive dynamics presents a new
opportunity to develop generalist embodied agents in scannable environments
with complex physical behaviors. To this end, we present GDGen (Generalized
Representation for Generalized Dynamics Generation), a framework that takes a
potential energy perspective to seamlessly integrate rigid body, articulated
body, and soft body dynamics into a unified, geometry-agnostic system. GDGen
operates from the governing principle that the potential energy for any stable
physical system should be low. This fresh perspective allows us to treat the
world as one holistic entity and infer underlying physical properties from
simple motion observations. We extend classic elastodynamics by introducing
directional stiffness to capture a broad spectrum of physical behaviors,
covering soft elastic, articulated, and rigid body systems. We propose a
specialized network to model the extended material property and employ a neural
field to represent deformation in a geometry-agnostic manner. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GDGen robustly unifies diverse simulation
paradigms, offering a versatile foundation for creating interactive virtual
environments and training robotic agents in complex, dynamically rich
scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文提出了COLIPRI编码器家族，通过引入报告生成目标和结合视觉-语言预训练与纯视觉预训练，缓解3D医学影像领域数据不足的问题，在多个任务上实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D医学影像领域的数据可用性限制了当前视觉-语言编码器的能力，需要解决数据不足的问题。

Method: 引入报告生成目标，将视觉-语言预训练与纯视觉预训练相结合，利用图像-文本配对数据集和纯图像数据集，结合3D医学影像领域的最佳实践。

Result: COLIPRI编码器在报告生成、分类探测和零样本分类任务上达到最先进性能，在语义分割任务上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 通过注入额外的归纳偏置和利用更多数据，可以有效提升3D医学影像视觉-语言编码器的性能。

Abstract: Vision-language pre-training, i.e., aligning images with paired text, is a
powerful paradigm to create encoders that can be directly used for tasks such
as classification and retrieval, and for downstream tasks such as segmentation
and report generation. In the 3D medical image domain, these capabilities allow
vision-language encoders (VLEs) to support radiologists by retrieving patients
with similar abnormalities or predicting likelihoods of abnormality. While the
methodology holds promise, data availability limits the capabilities of current
3D VLEs.
  In this paper, we alleviate the lack of data by injecting additional
inductive biases: introducing a report generation objective and pairing
vision-language pre-training with vision-only pre-training. This allows us to
leverage both image-only and paired image-text 3D datasets, increasing the
total amount of data to which our model is exposed. Through these additional
inductive biases, paired with best practices of the 3D medical imaging domain,
we develop the Comprehensive Language-image Pre-training (COLIPRI) encoder
family. Our COLIPRI encoders achieve state-of-the-art performance in report
generation, classification probing, and zero-shot classification, and remain
competitive for semantic segmentation.

TL;DR: 提出DRIFT方法，通过梯度空间转移推理知识来提升多模态大语言模型的推理能力，避免参数合并的不稳定性，在多个基准测试中表现优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型的推理能力落后于纯文本模型，现有提升方法需要大量资源，而简单的模型参数合并在不同模型家族中效果不稳定。

Method: DRIFT方法：预计算推理先验作为参数空间差异，在微调过程中用其偏置梯度，实现推理知识的梯度空间转移。

Result: 在MathVista和MathVerse等基准测试中，DRIFT方法相比朴素合并和监督微调持续提升推理性能，以较低成本达到或超越资源密集型方法。

Conclusion: DRIFT提供了一种轻量级且有效的多模态推理能力提升方案，在保持标准微调流程的同时实现了高效的推理知识转移。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are rapidly advancing, yet their
reasoning ability often lags behind that of strong text-only counterparts.
Existing methods to bridge this gap rely on supervised fine-tuning over
large-scale multimodal reasoning data or reinforcement learning, both of which
are resource-intensive. A promising alternative is model merging, which
interpolates parameters between reasoning-enhanced LLMs and multimodal
variants. However, our analysis shows that naive merging is not always a "free
lunch": its effectiveness varies drastically across model families, with some
(e.g., LLaVA, Idefics) benefiting while others (e.g., Qwen) suffer performance
degradation. To address this, we propose Directional Reasoning Injection for
Fine-Tuning (DRIFT) MLLMs, a lightweight method that transfers reasoning
knowledge in the gradient space, without destabilizing multimodal alignment.
DRIFT precomputes a reasoning prior as the parameter-space difference between
reasoning and multimodal variants, then uses it to bias gradients during
multimodal fine-tuning. This approach preserves the simplicity of standard
supervised fine-tuning pipelines while enabling efficient reasoning transfer.
Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks, including MathVista
and MathVerse, demonstrate that DRIFT consistently improves reasoning
performance over naive merging and supervised fine-tuning, while matching or
surpassing training-heavy methods at a fraction of the cost.

TL;DR: 婴儿日常视觉体验的统计特性（块状相似性结构）支持早期类别学习和泛化，这种结构在小数据集机器学习中也能提升泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索婴儿如何从有限经验中实现稳健的类别学习和泛化，解决婴儿学习能力与经验有限性之间的矛盾。

Method: 分析14名7-11个月婴儿的自我中心视角图像数据，发现视觉输入具有块状相似性结构；通过计算实验验证这种结构在机器学习中的效果。

Result: 婴儿日常视觉体验确实呈现块状相似性结构，包含高度相似图像簇和罕见变化图像；机器学习实验证明这种结构能提升小数据集的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 婴儿自然体验的块状结构可能是早期类别学习的关键机制，并为各种学习问题提供高效学习原则。

Abstract: Young children readily recognize and generalize visual objects labeled by
common nouns, suggesting that these basic level object categories may be given.
Yet if they are, how they arise remains unclear. We propose that the answer
lies in the statistics of infant daily life visual experiences. Whereas large
and diverse datasets typically support robust learning and generalization in
human and machine learning, infants achieve this generalization from limited
experiences. We suggest that the resolution of this apparent contradiction lies
in the visual diversity of daily life, repeated experiences with single object
instances. Analyzing egocentric images from 14 infants (aged 7 to 11 months) we
show that their everyday visual input exhibits a lumpy similarity structure,
with clusters of highly similar images interspersed with rarer, more variable
ones, across eight early-learned categories. Computational experiments show
that mimicking this structure in machines improves generalization from small
datasets in machine learning. The natural lumpiness of infant experience may
thus support early category learning and generalization and, more broadly,
offer principles for efficient learning across a variety of problems and kinds
of learners.

TL;DR: SaLon3R是一个用于长时序3D高斯溅射重建的新框架，通过引入紧凑锚点基元和3D点Transformer，实现了冗余消除和几何一致性，能够在超过50个视图上以10+ FPS进行在线重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3DGS方法在长时序视频序列中会产生大量冗余和几何不一致问题，需要一种能够在线处理长时序输入的高效重建方法。

Method: 使用紧凑锚点基元通过可微分显著性感知高斯量化消除冗余，结合3D点Transformer来优化锚点属性和显著性，实现区域自适应高斯解码。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能，在超过50个视图上以10+ FPS进行重建，冗余消除率达到50%到90%，在新型视图合成和深度估计方面表现优异。

Conclusion: SaLon3R是第一个能够在长时序视频序列中实现高效在线重建的通用化3DGS方法，具有优越的效率、鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled generalizable,
on-the-fly reconstruction of sequential input views. However, existing methods
often predict per-pixel Gaussians and combine Gaussians from all views as the
scene representation, leading to substantial redundancies and geometric
inconsistencies in long-duration video sequences. To address this, we propose
SaLon3R, a novel framework for Structure-aware, Long-term 3DGS Reconstruction.
To our best knowledge, SaLon3R is the first online generalizable GS method
capable of reconstructing over 50 views in over 10 FPS, with 50% to 90%
redundancy removal. Our method introduces compact anchor primitives to
eliminate redundancy through differentiable saliency-aware Gaussian
quantization, coupled with a 3D Point Transformer that refines anchor
attributes and saliency to resolve cross-frame geometric and photometric
inconsistencies. Specifically, we first leverage a 3D reconstruction backbone
to predict dense per-pixel Gaussians and a saliency map encoding regional
geometric complexity. Redundant Gaussians are compressed into compact anchors
by prioritizing high-complexity regions. The 3D Point Transformer then learns
spatial structural priors in 3D space from training data to refine anchor
attributes and saliency, enabling regionally adaptive Gaussian decoding for
geometric fidelity. Without known camera parameters or test-time optimization,
our approach effectively resolves artifacts and prunes the redundant 3DGS in a
single feed-forward pass. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate our
state-of-the-art performance on both novel view synthesis and depth estimation,
demonstrating superior efficiency, robustness, and generalization ability for
long-term generalizable 3D reconstruction. Project Page:

TL;DR: TGT是一个文本引导轨迹框架，通过结合点轨迹和局部文本描述来控制视频生成，解决了多对象场景中运动控制的精度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频生成方法在控制场景中多个对象的精确位置和运动轨迹方面存在局限，特别是在复杂多对象设置中，缺乏清晰的轨迹与视觉实体对应关系。

Method: 提出位置感知交叉注意力机制和双CFG方案，分别调制局部和全局文本引导，并开发了数据流水线来生成带有跟踪实体局部描述的轨迹。

Result: 实验表明TGT在视觉质量、文本对齐准确性和运动可控性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TGT框架通过轨迹与文本的配对，实现了对视频中多个对象外观和运动的精确控制。

Abstract: Text-to-video generation has advanced rapidly in visual fidelity, whereas
standard methods still have limited ability to control the subject composition
of generated scenes. Prior work shows that adding localized text control
signals, such as bounding boxes or segmentation masks, can help. However, these
methods struggle in complex scenarios and degrade in multi-object settings,
offering limited precision and lacking a clear correspondence between
individual trajectories and visual entities as the number of controllable
objects increases. We introduce Text-Grounded Trajectories (TGT), a framework
that conditions video generation on trajectories paired with localized text
descriptions. We propose Location-Aware Cross-Attention (LACA) to integrate
these signals and adopt a dual-CFG scheme to separately modulate local and
global text guidance. In addition, we develop a data processing pipeline that
produces trajectories with localized descriptions of tracked entities, and we
annotate two million high quality video clips to train TGT. Together, these
components enable TGT to use point trajectories as intuitive motion handles,
pairing each trajectory with text to control both appearance and motion.
Extensive experiments show that TGT achieves higher visual quality, more
accurate text alignment, and improved motion controllability compared with
prior approaches. Website: https://textgroundedtraj.github.io.

Conclusion: 扩散先验有潜力成为脑MRI分析的通用工具，能够提高解剖保真度并改进现有深度学习方法的输出

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful generative models in
medical imaging. However, it remains a major challenge to combine these
data-driven models with domain knowledge to guide brain imaging problems. In
neuroimaging, Bayesian inverse problems have long provided a successful
framework for inference tasks, where incorporating domain knowledge of the
imaging process enables robust performance without requiring extensive training
data. However, the anatomical modeling component of these approaches typically
relies on classical mathematical priors that often fail to capture the complex
structure of brain anatomy. In this work, we present the first general-purpose
application of diffusion models as priors for solving a wide range of medical
imaging inverse problems. Our approach leverages a score-based diffusion prior
trained extensively on diverse brain MRI data, paired with flexible forward
models that capture common image processing tasks such as super-resolution,
bias field correction, inpainting, and combinations thereof. We further
demonstrate how our framework can refine outputs from existing deep learning
methods to improve anatomical fidelity. Experiments on heterogeneous clinical
and research MRI data show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance producing consistent, high-quality solutions without requiring
paired training datasets. These results highlight the potential of diffusion
priors as versatile tools for brain MRI analysis.

TL;DR: 提出了FFT-MIL框架，通过频域分支增强多实例学习，在WSI分类中捕获全局依赖关系，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有WSI分类方法由于图像尺寸巨大和局部补丁嵌入的特性，难以捕获全局依赖关系，这限制了粗粒度结构的建模能力。

Method: 使用快速傅里叶变换从WSI中提取低频分量，通过FFT-Block（卷积层和Min-Max归一化）处理频域数据，然后将全局频域特征与空间补丁特征融合。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上评估六种先进MIL方法，FFT-Block集成平均提升宏F1分数3.51%，AUC提升1.51%，在不同架构和数据集上均表现一致改进。

Conclusion: 频域学习是捕获WSI分类中全局依赖关系的有效机制，补充了空间特征，提升了基于MIL的计算病理学的可扩展性和准确性。

Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification relies on Multiple Instance Learning
(MIL) with spatial patch features, yet existing methods struggle to capture
global dependencies due to the immense size of WSIs and the local nature of
patch embeddings. This limitation hinders the modeling of coarse structures
essential for robust diagnostic prediction.
  We propose Fourier Transform Multiple Instance Learning (FFT-MIL), a
framework that augments MIL with a frequency-domain branch to provide compact
global context. Low-frequency crops are extracted from WSIs via the Fast
Fourier Transform and processed through a modular FFT-Block composed of
convolutional layers and Min-Max normalization to mitigate the high variance of
frequency data. The learned global frequency feature is fused with spatial
patch features through lightweight integration strategies, enabling
compatibility with diverse MIL architectures.
  FFT-MIL was evaluated across six state-of-the-art MIL methods on three public
datasets (BRACS, LUAD, and IMP). Integration of the FFT-Block improved macro F1
scores by an average of 3.51% and AUC by 1.51%, demonstrating consistent gains
across architectures and datasets. These results establish frequency-domain
learning as an effective and efficient mechanism for capturing global
dependencies in WSI classification, complementing spatial features and
advancing the scalability and accuracy of MIL-based computational pathology.

TL;DR: 提出了XModBench基准测试，用于评估全模态大语言模型在跨模态一致性方面的表现，发现现有模型在空间时间推理、模态差异和方向不平衡方面存在显著问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要评估通用跨模态问答能力，但不清楚全模态大语言模型是否真正实现模态不变推理还是存在模态特定偏见。

Method: 构建包含60,828个多选题的XModBench基准，涵盖5个任务家族和6种模态组合，系统评估模型的模态不变推理、模态差异和方向不平衡。

Result: 实验显示最强模型Gemini 2.5 Pro在空间时间推理准确率低于60%，存在持续模态差异（音频表现显著差于文本），以及系统方向不平衡（视觉作为上下文时一致性更低）。

Conclusion: 当前全模态大语言模型远未实现真正的模态不变推理，XModBench可作为评估和改进跨模态能力的基础诊断工具。

Abstract: Omni-modal large language models (OLLMs) aim to unify audio, vision, and text
understanding within a single framework. While existing benchmarks primarily
evaluate general cross-modal question-answering ability, it remains unclear
whether OLLMs achieve modality-invariant reasoning or exhibit modality-specific
biases. We introduce XModBench, a large-scale tri-modal benchmark explicitly
designed to measure cross-modal consistency. XModBench comprises 60,828
multiple-choice questions spanning five task families and systematically covers
all six modality compositions in question-answer pairs, enabling fine-grained
diagnosis of an OLLM's modality-invariant reasoning, modality disparity, and
directional imbalance. Experiments show that even the strongest model, Gemini
2.5 Pro, (i) struggles with spatial and temporal reasoning, achieving less than
60% accuracy, (ii) reveals persistent modality disparities, with performance
dropping substantially when the same semantic content is conveyed through audio
rather than text, and (iii) shows systematic directional imbalance, exhibiting
lower consistency when vision serves as context compared to text. These
findings indicate that current OLLMs remain far from truly modality-invariant
reasoning and position XModBench as a fundamental diagnostic tool for
evaluating and improving cross-modal competence. All data and evaluation tools
will be available at https://xingruiwang.github.io/projects/XModBench/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在图像-文本描述数据和交错文档数据的混合预训练中，对高质量数据筛选的研究不足，需要开发有效的数据质量评估方法。

Method: 采用半合成方法，利用原始图像生成不同质量等级的文本，创建样本-分数对来训练UniFilter分类器，然后应用于DataComp和OBELICS数据集的数据筛选。

Result: 使用UniFilter筛选的数据预训练的MLLM在零样本推理和上下文学习能力上显著提升，经过视觉监督微调后在多个基准测试中表现更好。

Conclusion: UniFilter方法能有效提升多模态预训练数据的质量，进而增强MLLM的下游任务性能，为社区提供了可复现的数据和模型资源。

Abstract: The Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are continually pre-trained on a
mixture of image-text caption data and interleaved document data, while the
high-quality data filtering towards image-text interleaved document data is
under-explored. We propose to train an efficient MLLM as a Unified Mulitmodal
Data Quality Classifier to Filter both high-quality image-text caption and
interleaved data (UniFilter). To address the challenge of collecting diverse
labeled multimodal data, we introduce a semi-synthetic approach that leverages
readily available raw images and generates corresponding text across four
quality levels. This method enables efficient creation of sample-score pairs
for both caption and interleaved document data to train UniFilter. We apply
UniFilter to curate high-quality caption data from DataComp caption dataset and
interleaved data from the OBELICS image-text interleaved dataset. MLLMs
pre-trained on the filtered data demonstrate significantly enhanced
capabilities compared to those trained on baseline-filtered data, achieving
stronger zero-shot reasoning and in-context learning capabilities. After visual
supervised fine-tuning, these UniFilter-induced MLLMs achieve stronger
performance on various benchmarks, highlighting the downstream benefits of
high-quality multimodal pre-training. We release the synthetic training data
used for training UniFilter, the UniFilter model checkpoints, and the
high-quality interleaved document subset OBELICS-HQ, curated by UniFilter, to
the community for reproduction and further development.

TL;DR: 本文研究了组织病理学基础模型训练中的可复现性问题，通过在QUILT-1M数据集上训练CLIP模型，系统评估了不同超参数设置和数据增强策略对三个下游数据集的影响，并提出了提高可复现性的实用规则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决组织病理学基础模型训练中的可复现性挑战，这些挑战主要源于软件随机性、硬件非确定性和超参数报告不一致。

Method: 在QUILT-1M数据集上训练CLIP模型，系统评估不同超参数设置（如RandomResizedCrop值、分布式训练策略、学习率）和数据增强策略在三个下游组织病理学数据集（PatchCamelyon、LC25000-Lung、LC25000-Colon）上的影响。

Result: 发现RandomResizedCrop值在0.7-0.8时表现最佳，分布式训练不使用局部损失能提高稳定性，学习率低于5.0e-5会在所有数据集上降低性能，LC25000（Colon）数据集提供了最可复现的基准。

Conclusion: 计算病理学中的可复现性不仅依赖于透明文档，还需要精心选择的实验配置，本文提供了开发可复现数字病理学基础模型的实用指导规则。

Abstract: Reproducibility remains a critical challenge in foundation model training for
histopathology, often hindered by software randomness, hardware
non-determinism, and inconsistent hyperparameter reporting. To investigate
these issues, we trained a CLIP model on the QUILT-1M dataset and
systematically evaluated the impact of different hyperparameter settings and
augmentation strategies across three downstream histopathology datasets
(PatchCamelyon, LC25000-Lung, and LC25000-Colon). Despite variability across
runs, we identified clear trends: RandomResizedCrop values of 0.7-0.8
outperformed more aggressive (0.6) or conservative (0.9) settings, distributed
training without local loss improved stability, and learning rates below 5.0e-5
consistently degraded performance across all datasets. The LC25000 (Colon)
dataset consistently provided the most reproducible benchmark. These findings
highlight that reproducibility in computational pathology depends not only on
transparent documentation but also on carefully chosen experimental
configurations, and we provide practical rules to guide future efforts in
developing reproducible foundation models for digital pathology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图像和文本提示的生成数据增强方法难以平衡保真度和多样性，因为合成过程中的表示往往与非必要的输入图像属性（如环境上下文）纠缠，与修改这些元素的文本提示产生冲突。

Method: 使用显著概念感知图像嵌入模型来减少合成过程中无关视觉细节的影响，保持图像和文本输入之间的直观对齐，通过生成更好地保留类判别特征并具有额外受控变化的图像来增强训练数据多样性。

Result: 在八个细粒度视觉数据集上表现出优越性能，在常规和长尾设置下分别以0.73%和6.5%的平均分类准确率提升优于最先进的增强方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过减少无关视觉细节的影响，在保持图像-文本对齐的同时有效增强训练数据多样性，显著提升了下游模型的鲁棒性和分类性能。

Abstract: Recent generative data augmentation methods conditioned on both image and
text prompts struggle to balance between fidelity and diversity, as it is
challenging to preserve essential image details while aligning with varied text
prompts. This challenge arises because representations in the synthesis process
often become entangled with non-essential input image attributes such as
environmental contexts, creating conflicts with text prompts intended to modify
these elements. To address this, we propose a personalized image generation
framework that uses a salient concept-aware image embedding model to reduce the
influence of irrelevant visual details during the synthesis process, thereby
maintaining intuitive alignment between image and text inputs. By generating
images that better preserve class-discriminative features with additional
controlled variations, our framework effectively enhances the diversity of
training datasets and thereby improves the robustness of downstream models. Our
approach demonstrates superior performance across eight fine-grained vision
datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art augmentation methods with averaged
classification accuracy improvements by 0.73% and 6.5% under conventional and
long-tail settings, respectively.

Conclusion: CARDIUM数据集和多模态Transformer架构为产前先天性心脏病检测提供了有效的解决方案，将公开数据集和代码以促进该领域研究。

Abstract: Prenatal diagnosis of Congenital Heart Diseases (CHDs) holds great potential
for Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven solutions. However, collecting
high-quality diagnostic data remains difficult due to the rarity of these
conditions, resulting in imbalanced and low-quality datasets that hinder model
performance. Moreover, no public efforts have been made to integrate multiple
sources of information, such as imaging and clinical data, further limiting the
ability of AI models to support and enhance clinical decision-making. To
overcome these challenges, we introduce the Congenital Anomaly Recognition with
Diagnostic Images and Unified Medical records (CARDIUM) dataset, the first
publicly available multimodal dataset consolidating fetal ultrasound and
echocardiographic images along with maternal clinical records for prenatal CHD
detection. Furthermore, we propose a robust multimodal transformer architecture
that incorporates a cross-attention mechanism to fuse feature representations
from image and tabular data, improving CHD detection by 11% and 50% over image
and tabular single-modality approaches, respectively, and achieving an F1 score
of 79.8 $\pm$ 4.8% in the CARDIUM dataset. We will publicly release our dataset

Conclusion: DriveGen3D成功整合了加速长期视频生成与大规模动态场景重建，通过多模态条件控制实现了高质量、可控的动态3D驾驶场景生成。

Abstract: We present DriveGen3D, a novel framework for generating high-quality and
highly controllable dynamic 3D driving scenes that addresses critical
limitations in existing methodologies. Current approaches to driving scene
synthesis either suffer from prohibitive computational demands for extended
temporal generation, focus exclusively on prolonged video synthesis without 3D
representation, or restrict themselves to static single-scene reconstruction.
Our work bridges this methodological gap by integrating accelerated long-term
video generation with large-scale dynamic scene reconstruction through
multimodal conditional control. DriveGen3D introduces a unified pipeline
consisting of two specialized components: FastDrive-DiT, an efficient video
diffusion transformer for high-resolution, temporally coherent video synthesis
under text and Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) layout guidance; and FastRecon3D, a
feed-forward reconstruction module that rapidly builds 3D Gaussian
representations across time, ensuring spatial-temporal consistency. Together,
these components enable real-time generation of extended driving videos (up to
$424\times800$ at 12 FPS) and corresponding dynamic 3D scenes, achieving SSIM
of 0.811 and PSNR of 22.84 on novel view synthesis, all while maintaining

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the primary imaging modality used in the
diagnosis, assessment, and treatment planning for brain pathologies. However,
most automated MRI analysis tools, such as segmentation and registration
pipelines, are optimized for healthy anatomies and often fail when confronted
with large lesions such as tumors. To overcome this, image inpainting
techniques aim to locally synthesize healthy brain tissues in tumor regions,
enabling the reliable application of general-purpose tools. In this work, we
systematically evaluate state-of-the-art inpainting models and observe a
saturation in their standalone performance. In response, we introduce a
methodology combining model ensembling with efficient post-processing
strategies such as median filtering, histogram matching, and pixel averaging.
Further anatomical refinement is achieved via a lightweight U-Net enhancement
stage. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that our proposed pipeline
improves the anatomical plausibility and visual fidelity of inpainted regions,
yielding higher accuracy and more robust outcomes than individual baseline
models. By combining established models with targeted post-processing, we
achieve improved and more accessible inpainting outcomes, supporting broader
clinical deployment and sustainable, resource-conscious research. Our 2025

Abstract: Recognizability, a key perceptual factor in human face processing, strongly
affects the performance of face recognition (FR) systems in both verification
and identification tasks. Effectively using recognizability to enhance feature
representation remains challenging. In deep FR, the loss function plays a
crucial role in shaping how features are embedded. However, current methods
have two main drawbacks: (i) recognizability is only partially captured through
soft margin constraints, resulting in weaker quality representation and lower
discrimination, especially for low-quality or ambiguous faces; (ii) mutual
overlapping gradients between feature direction and magnitude introduce
undesirable interactions during optimization, causing instability and confusion
in hypersphere planning, which may result in poor generalization, and entangled
representations where recognizability and identity are not cleanly separated.
To address these issues, we introduce a hard margin strategy - Quality Control
Face (QCFace), which overcomes the mutual overlapping gradient problem and
enables the clear decoupling of recognizability from identity representation.
Based on this strategy, a novel hard-margin-based loss function employs a
guidance factor for hypersphere planning, simultaneously optimizing for
recognition ability and explicit recognizability representation. Extensive
experiments confirm that QCFace not only provides robust and quantifiable
recognizability encoding but also achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
verification and identification benchmarks compared to existing
recognizability-based losses.

TL;DR: ORCA利用预训练文本到图像扩散模型获取任务自适应视觉表示用于机器人控制，通过可学习的任务提示和视觉提示来适应控制环境，无需微调模型本身。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的视觉表示在模仿学习中通常保持任务无关性，在策略学习期间保持冻结状态。本文探索利用预训练文本到图像扩散模型获取任务自适应视觉表示，以改进机器人控制性能。

Method: 提出ORCA方法，引入可学习的任务提示来适应控制环境，以及视觉提示来捕捉细粒度的帧特定细节，通过新设计的条件促进任务自适应表示。

Result: 该方法在各种机器人控制基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，显著超越了先前的方法。

Conclusion: 通过考虑控制所需的具体动态视觉信息，使用任务自适应条件可以显著提升预训练扩散模型在机器人控制任务中的表现。

Abstract: While pre-trained visual representations have significantly advanced
imitation learning, they are often task-agnostic as they remain frozen during
policy learning. In this work, we explore leveraging pre-trained text-to-image
diffusion models to obtain task-adaptive visual representations for robotic
control, without fine-tuning the model itself. However, we find that naively
applying textual conditions - a successful strategy in other vision domains -
yields minimal or even negative gains in control tasks. We attribute this to
the domain gap between the diffusion model's training data and robotic control
environments, leading us to argue for conditions that consider the specific,
dynamic visual information required for control. To this end, we propose ORCA,
which introduces learnable task prompts that adapt to the control environment
and visual prompts that capture fine-grained, frame-specific details. Through
facilitating task-adaptive representations with our newly devised conditions,
our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on various robotic control
benchmarks, significantly surpassing prior methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了首个双曲分类框架用于单正多标签学习，通过将标签表示为双曲球而非点或向量，能够同时建模层次结构、共现模式和语义独立性等多种标签关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单正多标签学习中每个训练样本仅标注一个正标签但可能属于多个类别的挑战，现有方法缺乏对不同关系类型的显式几何定义。

Method: 使用双曲球表示标签，通过球体交互建模标签关系；引入温度自适应双曲球分类器和物理启发的双井正则化来引导球体形成有意义的配置。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验表明具有竞争力的性能和优越的可解释性，统计分析显示学习到的嵌入与实际共现模式强相关。

Conclusion: 双曲几何为不完全监督下的结构化分类提供了更鲁棒的范式。

Abstract: Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPMLL) addresses the challenging
scenario where each training sample is annotated with only one positive label
despite potentially belonging to multiple categories, making it difficult to
capture complex label relationships and hierarchical structures. While existing
methods implicitly model label relationships through distance-based similarity,
lacking explicit geometric definitions for different relationship types. To
address these limitations, we propose the first hyperbolic classification
framework for SPMLL that represents each label as a hyperbolic ball rather than
a point or vector, enabling rich inter-label relationship modeling through
geometric ball interactions. Our ball-based approach naturally captures
multiple relationship types simultaneously: inclusion for hierarchical
structures, overlap for co-occurrence patterns, and separation for semantic
independence. Further, we introduce two key component innovations: a
temperature-adaptive hyperbolic ball classifier and a physics-inspired
double-well regularization that guides balls toward meaningful configurations.
To validate our approach, extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets
(MS-COCO, PASCAL VOC, NUS-WIDE, CUB-200-2011) demonstrate competitive
performance with superior interpretability compared to existing methods.
Furthermore, statistical analysis reveals strong correlation between learned
embeddings and real-world co-occurrence patterns, establishing hyperbolic
geometry as a more robust paradigm for structured classification under
incomplete supervision.

TL;DR: SVG是一种新型的潜在扩散模型，它不使用变分自编码器，而是利用自监督表示进行视觉生成。该方法通过冻结的DINO特征构建具有清晰语义判别性的特征空间，并通过轻量级残差分支捕捉细节，实现更高效的扩散训练和生成质量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的VAE+扩散范式存在训练效率低、推理速度慢、对其他视觉任务迁移性差的问题，这源于VAE潜在空间缺乏清晰的语义分离和强判别结构。研究表明这些属性对感知理解和潜在扩散模型的稳定高效训练至关重要。

Method: SVG利用冻结的DINO特征构建具有语义判别性的特征空间，同时使用轻量级残差分支捕捉细粒度细节。扩散模型直接在这个语义结构化的潜在空间上进行训练，从而实现更高效的学习。

Result: SVG实现了加速的扩散训练，支持少步采样，并提高了生成质量。实验结果表明SVG保留了底层自监督表示的语义和判别能力，为任务通用的高质量视觉表示提供了原则性途径。

Conclusion: SVG通过利用自监督表示构建语义结构化的潜在空间，克服了传统VAE+扩散范式的局限性，在训练效率、推理速度和生成质量方面都有显著提升，同时保持了语义判别能力。

Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion-based visual generation has largely relied on
latent diffusion models with variational autoencoders (VAEs). While effective
for high-fidelity synthesis, this VAE+diffusion paradigm suffers from limited
training efficiency, slow inference, and poor transferability to broader vision
tasks. These issues stem from a key limitation of VAE latent spaces: the lack
of clear semantic separation and strong discriminative structure. Our analysis
confirms that these properties are crucial not only for perception and
understanding tasks, but also for the stable and efficient training of latent
diffusion models. Motivated by this insight, we introduce SVG, a novel latent
diffusion model without variational autoencoders, which leverages
self-supervised representations for visual generation. SVG constructs a feature
space with clear semantic discriminability by leveraging frozen DINO features,
while a lightweight residual branch captures fine-grained details for
high-fidelity reconstruction. Diffusion models are trained directly on this
semantically structured latent space to facilitate more efficient learning. As
a result, SVG enables accelerated diffusion training, supports few-step
sampling, and improves generative quality. Experimental results further show
that SVG preserves the semantic and discriminative capabilities of the
underlying self-supervised representations, providing a principled pathway
toward task-general, high-quality visual representations.

TL;DR: CoMe是一个渐进式层剪枝框架，通过基于拼接的层合并技术和分层蒸馏后训练过程，解决大语言模型结构化剪枝中的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型结构化剪枝方法存在三个主要限制：直接移除层导致性能显著下降、线性权重层聚合能力不足、缺乏有效的后训练恢复机制。

Method: 提出通道敏感度指标用于细粒度通道选择，采用基于拼接的层合并方法融合相邻层的关键通道，并设计分层蒸馏协议实现高效知识迁移。

Result: 在7个基准测试上，CoMe达到最先进性能。当剪枝LLaMA-2-7b模型30%参数时，剪枝后模型保持原始平均准确率的83%。

Conclusion: CoMe通过渐进式剪枝和分层蒸馏有效解决了结构化剪枝的性能退化问题，为大语言模型压缩提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models excel at natural language processing tasks, but their
massive size leads to high computational and storage demands. Recent works have
sought to reduce their model size through layer-wise structured pruning.
However, they tend to ignore retaining the capabilities in the pruned part. In
this work, we re-examine structured pruning paradigms and uncover several key
limitations: 1) notable performance degradation due to direct layer removal, 2)
incompetent linear weight layer aggregation, and 3) the lack of effective
post-training recovery mechanisms. To address these limitations, we propose
CoMe, including a progressive layer pruning framework with a
Concatenation-based Merging technology and a hierarchical distillation
post-training process. Specifically, we introduce a channel sensitivity metric
that utilizes activation intensity and weight norms for fine-grained channel
selection. Subsequently, we employ a concatenation-based layer merging method
to fuse the most critical channels across adjacent layers, enabling progressive
model size reduction. Finally, we propose a hierarchical distillation protocol
that leverages the correspondences between the original and pruned model layers
established during pruning, thereby enabling efficient knowledge transfer.
Experiments on seven benchmarks show that CoMe achieves state-of-the-art
performance; when pruning 30% of LLaMA-2-7b's parameters, the pruned model
retains 83% of its original average accuracy. Our code is available at
https://github.com/MPI-Lab/CoMe.

Motivation: 现有面部关键点检测数据集定义不同数量的关键点，主流方法只能单数据集训练，限制了模型泛化能力和统一模型的发展。

Method: 提出Proto-Former框架，包含自适应原型感知编码器(APAE)进行特征提取和原型学习，渐进式原型感知解码器(PPAD)生成提示引导注意力，以及原型感知(PA)损失函数解决多数据集训练中的专家寻址不稳定问题。

Result: 在广泛使用的基准数据集上的大量实验表明，Proto-Former相比现有最先进方法取得了优越性能。

Conclusion: Proto-Former通过原型学习和多数据集联合训练，成功构建了统一的面部关键点检测框架，显著提升了模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved facial landmark
detection. However, existing facial landmark detection datasets often define
different numbers of landmarks, and most mainstream methods can only be trained
on a single dataset. This limits the model generalization to different datasets
and hinders the development of a unified model. To address this issue, we
propose Proto-Former, a unified, adaptive, end-to-end facial landmark detection
framework that explicitly enhances dataset-specific facial structural
representations (i.e., prototype). Proto-Former overcomes the limitations of
single-dataset training by enabling joint training across multiple datasets
within a unified architecture. Specifically, Proto-Former comprises two key
components: an Adaptive Prototype-Aware Encoder (APAE) that performs adaptive
feature extraction and learns prototype representations, and a Progressive
Prototype-Aware Decoder (PPAD) that refines these prototypes to generate
prompts that guide the model's attention to key facial regions. Furthermore, we
introduce a novel Prototype-Aware (PA) loss, which achieves optimal path
finding by constraining the selection weights of prototype experts. This loss
function effectively resolves the problem of prototype expert addressing
instability during multi-dataset training, alleviates gradient conflicts, and
enables the extraction of more accurate facial structure features. Extensive
experiments on widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that our Proto-Former
achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注2D空间理解，缺乏全面评估6D空间推理能力的框架，需要开发新的评估工具来测试大型多模态模型的复杂3维空间推理能力。

Method: 创建了Spatial457合成数据集，包含4个关键空间推理能力：多物体识别、2D位置、3D位置和3D方向，采用级联评估结构构建了7种问题类型和5个难度级别。

Result: 评估显示大型多模态模型性能随任务复杂度增加而普遍下降，特别是在3D推理和6D空间任务中表现不佳，通过相对性能下降率(RPDR)量化了3D推理能力的弱点。

Conclusion: 大型多模态模型在复杂3D空间推理方面存在显著局限，Spatial457数据集为评估和改进这些模型的6D空间推理能力提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Although large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in visual scene interpretation and reasoning, their capacity for
complex and precise 3-dimensional spatial reasoning remains uncertain. Existing
benchmarks focus predominantly on 2D spatial understanding and lack a framework
to comprehensively evaluate 6D spatial reasoning across varying complexities.
To address this limitation, we present Spatial457, a scalable and unbiased
synthetic dataset designed with 4 key capability for spatial reasoning:
multi-object recognition, 2D location, 3D location, and 3D orientation. We
develop a cascading evaluation structure, constructing 7 question types across
5 difficulty levels that range from basic single object recognition to our new
proposed complex 6D spatial reasoning tasks. We evaluated various large
multimodal models (LMMs) on PulseCheck457, observing a general decline in
performance as task complexity increases, particularly in 3D reasoning and 6D
spatial tasks. To quantify these challenges, we introduce the Relative
Performance Dropping Rate (RPDR), highlighting key weaknesses in 3D reasoning
capabilities. Leveraging the unbiased attribute design of our dataset, we also
uncover prediction biases across different attributes, with similar patterns
observed in real-world image settings. The code and data are released in

TL;DR: SHARE是一种利用场景几何空间线索来精确重建人体运动的技术，仅需单目RGB视频即可实现人体在3D空间中的准确定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的人体运动重建方法在准确将人体放置在3D空间中存在困难，这对于游戏、AR/VR和机器人等领域的自主代理很重要。

Method: SHARE首先估计每帧的人体网格和分割掩码，以及关键帧的场景点云图。通过迭代比较人体网格与使用掩码从场景提取的人体点云图，优化关键帧中的人体位置，并保持非关键帧人体网格相对于关键帧根关节位置的一致性。

Result: 广泛实验表明，SHARE在准确重建3D人体位置和周围场景方面优于现有方法，适用于精心策划的数据集和野外网络视频。

Conclusion: SHARE技术能够更准确地放置3D人体并重建周围场景，为各种应用场景提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Animating realistic character interactions with the surrounding environment
is important for autonomous agents in gaming, AR/VR, and robotics. However,
current methods for human motion reconstruction struggle with accurately
placing humans in 3D space. We introduce Scene-Human Aligned REconstruction
(SHARE), a technique that leverages the scene geometry's inherent spatial cues
to accurately ground human motion reconstruction. Each reconstruction relies
solely on a monocular RGB video from a stationary camera. SHARE first estimates
a human mesh and segmentation mask for every frame, alongside a scene point map
at keyframes. It iteratively refines the human's positions at these keyframes
by comparing the human mesh against the human point map extracted from the
scene using the mask. Crucially, we also ensure that non-keyframe human meshes
remain consistent by preserving their relative root joint positions to keyframe
root joints during optimization. Our approach enables more accurate 3D human
placement while reconstructing the surrounding scene, facilitating use cases on
both curated datasets and in-the-wild web videos. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SHARE outperforms existing methods.

Motivation: 当前端到端多模态模型使用不同的编码器和解码器处理输入输出信息，这种分离阻碍了各种模态的联合表示学习。

Method: 使用基于Mamba的多步选择扩散模型，通过统一变分自编码器逐步生成和精炼模态特定信息，实现编码和解码的统一处理。

Result: 在图像生成、图像描述、视觉问答、文本理解和推理任务中，MDM显著优于现有端到端模型，并能与GPT-4V、Gemini Pro等SOTA模型竞争。

Conclusion: MDM有效统一了多模态处理过程，同时保持计算效率，为端到端多模态架构开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Current end-to-end multi-modal models utilize different encoders and decoders
to process input and output information. This separation hinders the joint
representation learning of various modalities. To unify multi-modal processing,
we propose a novel architecture called MDM (Multi-modal Diffusion Mamba). MDM
utilizes a Mamba-based multi-step selection diffusion model to progressively
generate and refine modality-specific information through a unified variational
autoencoder for both encoding and decoding. This innovative approach allows MDM
to achieve superior performance when processing high-dimensional data,
particularly in generating high-resolution images and extended text sequences
simultaneously. Our evaluations in areas such as image generation, image
captioning, visual question answering, text comprehension, and reasoning tasks
demonstrate that MDM significantly outperforms existing end-to-end models
(MonoFormer, LlamaGen, and Chameleon etc.) and competes effectively with SOTA
models like GPT-4V, Gemini Pro, and Mistral. Our results validate MDM's
effectiveness in unifying multi-modal processes while maintaining computational
efficiency, establishing a new direction for end-to-end multi-modal
architectures.

Motivation: EEG和ECoG信号在运动想象分类中具有重要应用价值，但易受生理伪影干扰，现有Transformer方法难以捕捉细粒度依赖关系。

Method: 提出Cortical-SSM架构，扩展深度状态空间模型，整合捕捉EEG和ECoG信号的时域、空域和频域依赖关系。

Result: 在三个基准测试中（两个大规模公共MI EEG数据集和一个临床MI ECoG数据集）均优于基线方法，模型可视化显示能有效捕捉神经生理相关区域。

Conclusion: Cortical-SSM模型能有效处理EEG和ECoG信号分类任务，捕捉多域依赖关系，在运动想象分类中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Classification of electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocorticogram (ECoG)
signals obtained during motor imagery (MI) has substantial application
potential, including for communication assistance and rehabilitation support
for patients with motor impairments. These signals remain inherently
susceptible to physiological artifacts (e.g., eye blinking, swallowing), which
pose persistent challenges. Although Transformer-based approaches for
classifying EEG and ECoG signals have been widely adopted, they often struggle
to capture fine-grained dependencies within them. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Cortical-SSM, a novel architecture that extends deep
state space models to capture integrated dependencies of EEG and ECoG signals
across temporal, spatial, and frequency domains. We validated our method across
three benchmarks: 1) two large-scale public MI EEG datasets containing more
than 50 subjects, and 2) a clinical MI ECoG dataset recorded from a patient
with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Our method outperformed baseline methods on
the three benchmarks. Furthermore, visual explanations derived from our model
indicate that it effectively captures neurophysiologically relevant regions of
both EEG and ECoG signals.

Motivation: 微创手术中的自动化工具检测具有重要意义，但手术场景中标注数据有限，难以训练鲁棒的深度学习模型。

Method: 两阶段自适应微调：1) 线性探测阶段在预训练CNN架构上调节额外分类层；2) 渐进冻结阶段动态减少可微调层数，调节对手术领域的适应。

Result: 在Cholec80数据集上，该方法相比现有方法和传统微调技术提升了检测性能，达到96.4%的mAP。在CATARACTS眼科手术数据集上进一步验证了泛化能力。

Conclusion: 渐进冻结微调是改进各种手术程序中工具存在检测的有前景技术，在通用图像分类任务中具有更广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Minimally invasive surgery can benefit significantly from automated surgical
tool detection, enabling advanced analysis and assistance. However, the limited
availability of annotated data in surgical settings poses a challenge for
training robust deep learning models. This paper introduces a novel staged
adaptive fine-tuning approach consisting of two steps: a linear probing stage
to condition additional classification layers on a pre-trained CNN-based
architecture and a gradual freezing stage to dynamically reduce the
fine-tunable layers, aiming to regulate adaptation to the surgical domain. This
strategy reduces network complexity and improves efficiency, requiring only a
single training loop and eliminating the need for multiple iterations. We
validated our method on the Cholec80 dataset, employing CNN architectures
(ResNet-50 and DenseNet-121) pre-trained on ImageNet for detecting surgical
tools in cholecystectomy endoscopic videos. Our results demonstrate that our
method improves detection performance compared to existing approaches and
established fine-tuning techniques, achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of
96.4%. To assess its broader applicability, the generalizability of the
fine-tuning strategy was further confirmed on the CATARACTS dataset, a distinct
domain of minimally invasive ophthalmic surgery. These findings suggest that
gradual freezing fine-tuning is a promising technique for improving tool
presence detection in diverse surgical procedures and may have broader
applications in general image classification tasks.

Motivation: 当前多视图2D图像3D检测方法依赖深度预测恢复空间信息，需要LiDAR点云监督，但预测深度质量不佳，存在物体边界深度不连续和小物体难以区分的问题，且忽视跨视图一致性和尺度不变性。

Method: 使用频率感知空间金字塔编码器(FSPE)结合高频边缘线索和低频语义构建特征金字塔；跨视图尺度不变深度预测器(CSDP)估计像素级深度分布；位置深度编码器(PDE)生成3D深度感知特征；采用混合深度监督进行互补学习。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上的大量实验证明了该方法的有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: FreqPDE方法能够有效为2D图像特征添加空间信息，提升3D检测性能，无需LiDAR点云监督。

Abstract: Detecting 3D objects accurately from multi-view 2D images is a challenging
yet essential task in the field of autonomous driving. Current methods resort
to integrating depth prediction to recover the spatial information for object
query decoding, which necessitates explicit supervision from LiDAR points
during the training phase. However, the predicted depth quality is still
unsatisfactory such as depth discontinuity of object boundaries and
indistinction of small objects, which are mainly caused by the sparse
supervision of projected points and the use of high-level image features for
depth prediction. Besides, cross-view consistency and scale invariance are also
overlooked in previous methods. In this paper, we introduce Frequency-aware
Positional Depth Embedding (FreqPDE) to equip 2D image features with spatial
information for 3D detection transformer decoder, which can be obtained through
three main modules. Specifically, the Frequency-aware Spatial Pyramid Encoder
(FSPE) constructs a feature pyramid by combining high-frequency edge clues and
low-frequency semantics from different levels respectively. Then the Cross-view
Scale-invariant Depth Predictor (CSDP) estimates the pixel-level depth
distribution with cross-view and efficient channel attention mechanism.
Finally, the Positional Depth Encoder (PDE) combines the 2D image features and
3D position embeddings to generate the 3D depth-aware features for query
decoding. Additionally, hybrid depth supervision is adopted for complementary
depth learning from both metric and distribution aspects. Extensive experiments
conducted on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority
of our proposed method.

TL;DR: PFGS是一个姿态感知的3D高斯泼溅框架，通过多姿态图像融合解决单姿态重建不完整的问题，实现更完整的物体重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS方法假设物体在单一静态姿态下捕获，导致重建不完整，无法恢复被遮挡或自遮挡区域。需要解决从多姿态图像中重建完整物体的实际挑战。

Method: 提出迭代融合策略，将辅助姿态图像集融合到主姿态的统一3DGS表示中。结合全局和局部配准，利用背景特征进行单姿态相机姿态估计，使用基础模型进行跨姿态配准。

Result: PFGS在定性和定量评估中均优于强基线方法，产生更完整的重建结果和更高保真度的3DGS模型。

Conclusion: PFGS通过智能整合3D基础模型和姿态感知融合策略，成功解决了多姿态物体重建的完整性问题，同时克服了内存需求和精度限制。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled high-quality,
real-time novel-view synthesis from multi-view images. However, most existing
methods assume the object is captured in a single, static pose, resulting in
incomplete reconstructions that miss occluded or self-occluded regions. We
introduce PFGS, a pose-aware 3DGS framework that addresses the practical
challenge of reconstructing complete objects from multi-pose image captures.
Given images of an object in one main pose and several auxiliary poses, PFGS
iteratively fuses each auxiliary set into a unified 3DGS representation of the
main pose. Our pose-aware fusion strategy combines global and local
registration to merge views effectively and refine the 3DGS model. While recent
advances in 3D foundation models have improved registration robustness and
efficiency, they remain limited by high memory demands and suboptimal accuracy.
PFGS overcomes these challenges by incorporating them more intelligently into
the registration process: it leverages background features for per-pose camera
pose estimation and employs foundation models for cross-pose registration. This
design captures the best of both approaches while resolving background
inconsistency issues. Experimental results demonstrate that PFGS consistently
outperforms strong baselines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations,
producing more complete reconstructions and higher-fidelity 3DGS models.

Motivation: 现有流式方法在原始运动空间操作导致计算开销大且难以保持时间稳定性，而基于潜在空间的VAE-扩散框架虽然质量高但仅限于离线处理，需要弥合这一差距。

Method: 基于高性能离线框架，采用潜在空间流式架构，包含滑动窗口因果设计和解码运动特征注入，确保平滑运动过渡而不修改扩散模型架构。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在风格化质量和响应性之间取得了良好平衡，能够实现长序列实时任意风格化。

Conclusion: LILAC成功将离线VAE-扩散框架扩展到在线设置，实现了实时长序列运动风格化，解决了现有方法的计算开销和时间稳定性问题。

Abstract: Generating long and stylized human motions in real time is critical for
applications that demand continuous and responsive character control. Despite
its importance, existing streaming approaches often operate directly in the raw
motion space, leading to substantial computational overhead and making it
difficult to maintain temporal stability. In contrast, latent-space
VAE-Diffusion-based frameworks alleviate these issues and achieve high-quality
stylization, but they are generally confined to offline processing. To bridge
this gap, LILAC (Long-sequence Incremental Low-latency Arbitrary Motion
Stylization via Streaming VAE-Diffusion with Causal Decoding) builds upon a
recent high-performing offline framework for arbitrary motion stylization and
extends it to an online setting through a latent-space streaming architecture
with a sliding-window causal design and the injection of decoded motion
features to ensure smooth motion transitions. This architecture enables
long-sequence real-time arbitrary stylization without relying on future frames

TL;DR: 提出了MARIS基准和统一框架，解决水下开放词汇实例分割中的视觉退化和语义错位问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有水下实例分割方法受限于封闭词汇预测，无法识别新的海洋类别。水下场景存在严重视觉退化（如颜色衰减）和语义错位问题

Method: 提出包含两个互补组件的统一框架：几何先验增强模块（GPEM）利用稳定的部分级和结构线索保持对象一致性；语义对齐注入机制（SAIM）用领域特定先验丰富语言嵌入

Result: 在MARIS基准上，该框架在域内和跨域设置中均优于现有开放词汇基线方法

Conclusion: 为未来水下感知研究建立了坚实基础

Abstract: Most existing underwater instance segmentation approaches are constrained by
close-vocabulary prediction, limiting their ability to recognize novel marine
categories. To support evaluation, we introduce \textbf{MARIS}
(\underline{Mar}ine Open-Vocabulary \underline{I}nstance
\underline{S}egmentation), the first large-scale fine-grained benchmark for
underwater Open-Vocabulary (OV) segmentation, featuring a limited set of seen
categories and diverse unseen categories. Although OV segmentation has shown
promise on natural images, our analysis reveals that transfer to underwater
scenes suffers from severe visual degradation (e.g., color attenuation) and
semantic misalignment caused by lack underwater class definitions. To address
these issues, we propose a unified framework with two complementary components.
The Geometric Prior Enhancement Module (\textbf{GPEM}) leverages stable
part-level and structural cues to maintain object consistency under degraded
visual conditions. The Semantic Alignment Injection Mechanism (\textbf{SAIM})
enriches language embeddings with domain-specific priors, mitigating semantic
ambiguity and improving recognition of unseen categories. Experiments show that
our framework consistently outperforms existing OV baselines both In-Domain and
Cross-Domain setting on MARIS, establishing a strong foundation for future
underwater perception research.

TL;DR: LoSP-Prompt是一个用于多器官多切片多方向多b值多激发扩散加权磁共振成像的重建框架，通过物理建模和合成数据驱动的提示学习克服运动引起的相位伪影，实现高分辨率成像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多激发DWI在全身肿瘤诊断中的临床应用受到呼吸、蠕动等运动引起的严重相位伪影的限制，特别是在多器官、多切片、多方向和多b值的复杂场景下。

Method: 将激发间相位变化建模为高阶局部平滑相位(LoSP)，集成到低秩Hankel矩阵重建中，通过仅在模拟生理运动的合成腹部DWI数据上训练的提示学习自动设置算法秩参数。

Result: 在10,000+临床图像验证中：实现临床单激发DWI两倍空间分辨率；单个模型泛化到7个解剖区域；在图像质量、伪影抑制和噪声降低方面优于最先进方法，放射科医生评估得分4-5分。

Conclusion: 该方法消除了导航信号和真实数据监督，为高分辨率多器官多激发DWI提供了可解释的稳健解决方案，其扫描仪无关性能对精准肿瘤学具有变革潜力。

Abstract: Clinical adoption of multi-shot diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging
(multi-shot DWI) for body-wide tumor diagnostics is limited by severe
motion-induced phase artifacts from respiration, peristalsis, and so on,
compounded by multi-organ, multi-slice, multi-direction and multi-b-value
complexities. Here, we introduce a reconstruction framework, LoSP-Prompt, that
overcomes these challenges through physics-informed modeling and
synthetic-data-driven prompt learning. We model inter-shot phase variations as
a high-order Locally Smooth Phase (LoSP), integrated into a low-rank Hankel
matrix reconstruction. Crucially, the algorithm's rank parameter is
automatically set via prompt learning trained exclusively on synthetic
abdominal DWI data emulating physiological motion. Validated across 10,000+
clinical images (43 subjects, 4 scanner models, 5 centers), LoSP-Prompt: (1)
Achieved twice the spatial resolution of clinical single-shot DWI, enhancing
liver lesion conspicuity; (2) Generalized to seven diverse anatomical regions
(liver, kidney, sacroiliac, pelvis, knee, spinal cord, brain) with a single
model; (3) Outperformed state-of-the-art methods in image quality, artifact
suppression, and noise reduction (11 radiologists' evaluations on a 5-point
scale, $p<0.05$), achieving 4-5 points (excellent) on kidney DWI, 4 points
(good to excellent) on liver, sacroiliac and spinal cord DWI, and 3-4 points
(good) on knee and tumor brain. The approach eliminates navigator signals and
realistic data supervision, providing an interpretable, robust solution for
high-resolution multi-organ multi-shot DWI. Its scanner-agnostic performance
signifies transformative potential for precision oncology.

TL;DR: 提出LoD框架，通过任务特定学习而非攻击特定学习来检测未知越狱攻击，包含多模态安全概念激活向量和无监督攻击分类模块。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型仍易受越狱攻击，现有检测方法要么泛化性差，要么准确性和效率有限。

Method: 提出学习检测框架，包含多模态安全概念激活向量模块进行安全导向表示学习，以及安全模式自编码器模块进行无监督攻击分类。

Result: 在多种未知攻击上实现更高的检测AUROC，同时提高了效率。

Conclusion: LoD框架能有效检测未知越狱攻击，具有更好的泛化性和效率。

Abstract: Despite extensive alignment efforts, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, posing serious safety risks. To address
this, existing detection methods either learn attack-specific parameters, which
hinders generalization to unseen attacks, or rely on heuristically sound
principles, which limit accuracy and efficiency. To overcome these limitations,
we propose Learning to Detect (LoD), a general framework that accurately
detects unknown jailbreak attacks by shifting the focus from attack-specific
learning to task-specific learning. This framework includes a Multi-modal
Safety Concept Activation Vector module for safety-oriented representation
learning and a Safety Pattern Auto-Encoder module for unsupervised attack
classification. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves
consistently higher detection AUROC on diverse unknown attacks while improving
efficiency. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Semantic4Safety是一个利用街景图像和零样本语义分割来分析交通事故风险的框架，通过构建11个可解释的街景指标，结合机器学习模型和因果推断方法来量化不同事故类型的因果影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决街景图像在交通安全分析中的两个核心挑战：如何构建捕捉事故相关特征的街级指标，以及如何量化这些指标对不同事故类型的因果影响。

Method: 应用零样本语义分割从街景图像中提取11个可解释的街景指标，结合道路类型作为上下文信息，使用XGBoost多分类器和SHAP进行特征解释，然后应用广义倾向得分加权和平均处理效应估计来控制混杂因素并量化因果效应。

Result: 发现了异质性的、特定于事故类型的因果模式：捕捉场景复杂性、暴露度和道路几何形状的特征主导预测能力；更大的可驾驶区域和应急空间降低风险，而过度视觉开放可能增加风险。

Conclusion: 通过将预测建模与因果推断相结合，Semantic4Safety支持有针对性的干预措施和高风险走廊诊断，为城市道路安全规划提供了一个可扩展的、数据驱动的工具。

Abstract: Street-view imagery (SVI) offers a fine-grained lens on traffic risk, yet two
fundamental challenges persist: (1) how to construct street-level indicators
that capture accident-related features, and (2) how to quantify their causal
impacts across different accident types. To address these challenges, we
propose Semantic4Safety, a framework that applies zero-shot semantic
segmentation to SVIs to derive 11 interpretable streetscape indicators, and
integrates road type as contextual information to analyze approximately 30,000
accident records in Austin. Specifically, we train an eXtreme Gradient Boosting
(XGBoost) multi-class classifier and use Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP)
to interpret both global and local feature contributions, and then apply
Generalized Propensity Score (GPS) weighting and Average Treatment Effect (ATE)
estimation to control confounding and quantify causal effects. Results uncover
heterogeneous, accident-type-specific causal patterns: features capturing scene
complexity, exposure, and roadway geometry dominate predictive power; larger
drivable area and emergency space reduce risk, whereas excessive visual
openness can increase it. By bridging predictive modeling with causal
inference, Semantic4Safety supports targeted interventions and high-risk
corridor diagnosis, offering a scalable, data-informed tool for urban road
safety planning.

TL;DR: 提出了预测-校正（PC）范式，通过解耦建模任务来加速学习。基于此提出了PCMambaNet网络，包含预测先验模块和校正残差网络，在脑MRI分割中仅需1-5个epoch即可达到最先进精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决端到端深度学习收敛慢、依赖大数据集的问题，特别是在数据稀缺的医学影像领域提高学习效率和适用性。

Method: 使用预测-校正范式：预测先验模块利用解剖知识（双侧对称性）生成粗略近似；校正残差网络学习残差误差，专注于精炼困难区域和病理边界。

Result: 在高分辨率脑MRI分割实验中，PCMambaNet达到最先进精度，且仅需1-5个epoch即可收敛，这是传统端到端模型无法实现的。

Conclusion: 通过显式融入领域知识简化学习目标，PCMambaNet有效缓解了数据效率低下和过拟合问题，实现了显著的学习加速。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of the end-to-end paradigm in deep learning,
it often suffers from slow convergence and heavy reliance on large-scale
datasets, which fundamentally limits its efficiency and applicability in
data-scarce domains such as medical imaging. In this work, we introduce the
Predictive-Corrective (PC) paradigm, a framework that decouples the modeling
task to fundamentally accelerate learning. Building upon this paradigm, we
propose a novel network, termed PCMambaNet. PCMambaNet is composed of two
synergistic modules. First, the Predictive Prior Module (PPM) generates a
coarse approximation at low computational cost, thereby anchoring the search
space. Specifically, the PPM leverages anatomical knowledge-bilateral
symmetry-to predict a 'focus map' of diagnostically relevant asymmetric
regions. Next, the Corrective Residual Network (CRN) learns to model the
residual error, focusing the network's full capacity on refining these
challenging regions and delineating precise pathological boundaries. Extensive
experiments on high-resolution brain MRI segmentation demonstrate that
PCMambaNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while converging within only 1-5
epochs-a performance unattainable by conventional end-to-end models. This
dramatic acceleration highlights that by explicitly incorporating domain
knowledge to simplify the learning objective, PCMambaNet effectively mitigates
data inefficiency and overfitting.

TL;DR: 提出了证据优先的自适应框架EARL，通过强化学习让模型主动选择关键帧并进行局部重采样，在多个视频推理基准上达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长视频推理中的信息稀释问题，现有方法缺乏严格的奖励机制来确保证据纯度，且无法在预采样帧之外进行时间信息补充。

Method: 证据感知强化学习(EARL)框架，让模型成为证据的主动询问者，动态选择最相关帧并在关键帧周围进行局部重采样以获取细粒度时间细节。

Result: 在五个视频推理基准测试中达到开源Video LLMs的最新水平，7B模型在LongVideoBench上达到59.8%，MVBench上69.0%，VideoMME上64.9%。

Conclusion: 证据纯度的优先考虑和提出的框架的有效性得到了验证，通过"少选择，多推理"的核心理念显著提升了长视频推理性能。

Abstract: Long-form video reasoning remains a major challenge for Video Large Language
Models (Video LLMs), as static uniform frame sampling leads to information
dilution and obscures critical evidence. Furthermore, existing pixel-space
video reasoning agents, which are designed to actively interact with the video
to acquire new visual information, remain suboptimal due to their lack of
rigorous reward mechanisms to enforce evidence purity and their inability to
perform temporal information supplementation beyond pre-sampled frames. To
address this critical gap, we propose a novel evidence-prioritized adaptive
framework built upon our core philosophy: "Select Less, Reason More." Our core
contribution is the evidence-aware reinforcement learning (EARL) framework,
which transforms the model into an active interrogator of evidence. EARL is
precisely engineered to dynamically select the most relevant frames and,
crucially, to perform localized re-sampling around the selected key frames to
access fine-grained temporal detail. Extensive experiments on five demanding
video reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our EARL-trained model achieves new
state-of-the-art among open-source Video LLMs, simultaneously learning an
effective and high-purity visual evidence selection policy. Impressively, our
7B model achieves 59.8% on LongVideoBench, 69.0% on MVBench and 64.9% on
VideoMME. These results highlight the importance of prioritizing evidence
purity and the effectiveness of our framework.

TL;DR: MAVR-Net是一个基于多视角学习的微型飞行器动作识别框架，结合RGB帧、光流和分割掩码三种互补数据，通过跨视角注意力模块和多尺度特征金字塔提升MAV运动识别的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于RGB数据的视觉识别模型难以捕捉微型飞行器复杂的时空运动特征，限制了区分不同动作的能力。

Method: 使用ResNet编码器从三个视角提取特征，采用多尺度特征金字塔保留时空细节，引入跨视角注意力模块建模多模态依赖关系，设计多视角对齐损失确保语义一致性。

Result: 在基准MAV动作数据集上表现优异，在Short MAV、Medium MAV和Long MAV数据集上分别达到97.8%、96.5%和92.8%的准确率。

Conclusion: 提出的多视角学习方法显著提升了MAV动作识别的性能，证明了多模态数据融合的有效性。

Abstract: Recognizing the motion of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) is crucial for
enabling cooperative perception and control in autonomous aerial swarms. Yet,
vision-based recognition models relying only on RGB data often fail to capture
the complex spatial temporal characteristics of MAV motion, which limits their
ability to distinguish different actions. To overcome this problem, this paper
presents MAVR-Net, a multi-view learning-based MAV action recognition
framework. Unlike traditional single-view methods, the proposed approach
combines three complementary types of data, including raw RGB frames, optical
flow, and segmentation masks, to improve the robustness and accuracy of MAV
motion recognition. Specifically, ResNet-based encoders are used to extract
discriminative features from each view, and a multi-scale feature pyramid is
adopted to preserve the spatiotemporal details of MAV motion patterns. To
enhance the interaction between different views, a cross-view attention module
is introduced to model the dependencies among various modalities and feature
scales. In addition, a multi-view alignment loss is designed to ensure semantic
consistency and strengthen cross-view feature representations. Experimental
results on benchmark MAV action datasets show that our method clearly
outperforms existing approaches, achieving 97.8\%, 96.5\%, and 92.8\% accuracy
on the Short MAV, Medium MAV, and Long MAV datasets, respectively.

TL;DR: DPTrack是一种基于提示学习的夜间空中跟踪器，通过将目标属性特征编码到包含细粒度线索的方向核中，生成精确的提示来改进夜间跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于提示学习的夜间空中跟踪器仅依赖空间定位监督，无法提供指向目标特征的细粒度线索，导致提示模糊，影响跟踪器准确聚焦目标特征的能力。

Method: DPTrack首先分层捕获目标的拓扑结构，利用拓扑属性丰富特征表示；然后编码器将这些拓扑感知特征压缩到方向核中；最后基于通道类别对应关系的核引导提示模块在搜索区域特征中传播核，定位目标特征位置并转换为精确提示。

Result: 在已建立的基准测试上进行广泛评估，证明了DPTrack的优越性能。

Conclusion: DPTrack通过编码目标属性特征到方向核并生成精确提示，有效解决了夜间空中跟踪中提示模糊的问题，实现了鲁棒的夜间跟踪。

Abstract: Existing nighttime aerial trackers based on prompt learning rely solely on
spatial localization supervision, which fails to provide fine-grained cues that
point to target features and inevitably produces vague prompts. This limitation
impairs the tracker's ability to accurately focus on the object features and
results in trackers still performing poorly. To address this issue, we propose
DPTrack, a prompt-based aerial tracker designed for nighttime scenarios by
encoding the given object's attribute features into the directional kernel
enriched with fine-grained cues to generate precise prompts. Specifically,
drawing inspiration from visual bionics, DPTrack first hierarchically captures
the object's topological structure, leveraging topological attributes to enrich
the feature representation. Subsequently, an encoder condenses these
topology-aware features into the directional kernel, which serves as the core
guidance signal that explicitly encapsulates the object's fine-grained
attribute cues. Finally, a kernel-guided prompt module built on
channel-category correspondence attributes propagates the kernel across the
features of the search region to pinpoint the positions of target features and
convert them into precise prompts, integrating spatial gating for robust
nighttime tracking. Extensive evaluations on established benchmarks demonstrate
DPTrack's superior performance. Our code will be available at
https://github.com/zzq-vipsl/DPTrack.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于动态图像的双阶段时间增强方法，将微表情序列分解为起始到顶点和顶点到结束两个运动阶段，分别生成动态图像，以丰富运动多样性并提升识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情识别面临标注数据稀缺的问题，现有方法主要依赖简单的空间增强而忽视了时间增强策略，限制了运动模式的多样性捕获。

Method: 将每个微表情序列分解为起始到顶点和顶点到结束两个运动阶段，为每个阶段生成独立的动态图像，形成双阶段动态图像增强策略。

Result: 在CASME-II和SAMM数据集上的实验表明，该方法在识别准确率、未加权F1分数和未加权平均召回率方面均取得一致提升，结合空间增强可获得高达10%的相对改进。

Conclusion: 该方法简单、模型无关且在低资源设置下有效，为鲁棒和可泛化的微表情识别提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are brief, involuntary facial movements that reveal
genuine emotions, typically lasting less than half a second. Recognizing these
subtle expressions is critical for applications in psychology, security, and
behavioral analysis. Although deep learning has enabled significant advances in
micro-expression recognition (MER), its effectiveness is limited by the
scarcity of annotated ME datasets. This data limitation not only hinders
generalization but also restricts the diversity of motion patterns captured
during training. Existing MER studies predominantly rely on simple spatial
augmentations (e.g., flipping, rotation) and overlook temporal augmentation
strategies that can better exploit motion characteristics. To address this gap,
this paper proposes a phase-aware temporal augmentation method based on dynamic
image. Rather than encoding the entire expression as a single onset-to-offset
dynamic image (DI), our approach decomposes each expression sequence into two
motion phases: onset-to-apex and apex-to-offset. A separate DI is generated for
each phase, forming a Dual-phase DI augmentation strategy. These phase-specific
representations enrich motion diversity and introduce complementary temporal
cues that are crucial for recognizing subtle facial transitions. Extensive
experiments on CASME-II and SAMM datasets using six deep architectures,
including CNNs, Vision Transformer, and the lightweight LEARNet, demonstrate
consistent performance improvements in recognition accuracy, unweighted
F1-score, and unweighted average recall, which are crucial for addressing class
imbalance in MER. When combined with spatial augmentations, our method achieves
up to a 10\% relative improvement. The proposed augmentation is simple,
model-agnostic, and effective in low-resource settings, offering a promising
direction for robust and generalizable MER.

Motivation: 传统SfM在驾驶场景的多相机系统中存在位姿估计不可靠、道路重建异常点多、重建效率低等问题，需要专门解决方案。

Method: 利用多相机系统固定空间关系增强位姿估计；使用平面模型过滤道路表面错误点；将多相机作为单一单元进行捆绑调整减少优化变量；采用粗到精的多场景聚合方法。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上达到0.124的绝对位姿误差，在真实车辆部署中验证了跨场景泛化能力和恶劣条件下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MRASfM框架有效解决了驾驶场景多相机SfM的关键挑战，在公开数据集上实现了最先进的性能表现。

Abstract: Structure from Motion (SfM) estimates camera poses and reconstructs point
clouds, forming a foundation for various tasks. However, applying SfM to
driving scenes captured by multi-camera systems presents significant
difficulties, including unreliable pose estimation, excessive outliers in road
surface reconstruction, and low reconstruction efficiency. To address these
limitations, we propose a Multi-camera Reconstruction and Aggregation
Structure-from-Motion (MRASfM) framework specifically designed for driving
scenes. MRASfM enhances the reliability of camera pose estimation by leveraging
the fixed spatial relationships within the multi-camera system during the
registration process. To improve the quality of road surface reconstruction,
our framework employs a plane model to effectively remove erroneous points from
the triangulated road surface. Moreover, treating the multi-camera set as a
single unit in Bundle Adjustment (BA) helps reduce optimization variables to
boost efficiency. In addition, MRASfM achieves multi-scene aggregation through
scene association and assembly modules in a coarse-to-fine fashion. We deployed
multi-camera systems on actual vehicles to validate the generalizability of
MRASfM across various scenes and its robustness in challenging conditions
through real-world applications. Furthermore, large-scale validation results on
public datasets show the state-of-the-art performance of MRASfM, achieving
0.124 absolute pose error on the nuScenes dataset.

Conclusion: ClapperText为低资源档案环境中的鲁棒OCR和文档理解提供了一个现实且文化基础的数据集资源。

Abstract: This paper presents ClapperText, a benchmark dataset for handwritten and
printed text recognition in visually degraded and low-resource settings. The
dataset is derived from 127 World War II-era archival video segments containing
clapperboards that record structured production metadata such as date,
location, and camera-operator identity. ClapperText includes 9,813 annotated
frames and 94,573 word-level text instances, 67% of which are handwritten and
1,566 are partially occluded. Each instance includes transcription, semantic
category, text type, and occlusion status, with annotations available as
rotated bounding boxes represented as 4-point polygons to support spatially
precise OCR applications. Recognizing clapperboard text poses significant
challenges, including motion blur, handwriting variation, exposure
fluctuations, and cluttered backgrounds, mirroring broader challenges in
historical document analysis where structured content appears in degraded,
non-standard forms. We provide both full-frame annotations and cropped word
images to support downstream tasks. Using a consistent per-video evaluation
protocol, we benchmark six representative recognition and seven detection
models under zero-shot and fine-tuned conditions. Despite the small training
set (18 videos), fine-tuning leads to substantial performance gains,
highlighting ClapperText's suitability for few-shot learning scenarios. The
dataset offers a realistic and culturally grounded resource for advancing
robust OCR and document understanding in low-resource archival contexts. The

Abstract: With the advancement of drone technology, the volume of video data increases
rapidly, creating an urgent need for efficient semantic retrieval. We are the
first to systematically propose and study the drone video-text retrieval (DVTR)
task. Drone videos feature overhead perspectives, strong structural
homogeneity, and diverse semantic expressions of target combinations, which
challenge existing cross-modal methods designed for ground-level views in
effectively modeling their characteristics. Therefore, dedicated retrieval
mechanisms tailored for drone scenarios are necessary. To address this issue,
we propose a novel approach called Multi-Semantic Adaptive Mining (MSAM). MSAM
introduces a multi-semantic adaptive learning mechanism, which incorporates
dynamic changes between frames and extracts rich semantic information from
specific scene regions, thereby enhancing the deep understanding and reasoning
of drone video content. This method relies on fine-grained interactions between
words and drone video frames, integrating an adaptive semantic construction
module, a distribution-driven semantic learning term and a diversity semantic
term to deepen the interaction between text and drone video modalities and
improve the robustness of feature representation. To reduce the interference of
complex backgrounds in drone videos, we introduce a cross-modal interactive
feature fusion pooling mechanism that focuses on feature extraction and
matching in target regions, minimizing noise effects. Extensive experiments on
two self-constructed drone video-text datasets show that MSAM outperforms other
existing methods in the drone video-text retrieval task. The source code and
dataset will be made publicly available.

fluorescence microscopy (confocal to super-resolution STED/deconvolved STED),
addressing the common challenge of unpaired datasets. By replacing the
traditional channel-doubling strategy in the U-Net-based generator with a fixed
channel approach, we drastically reduce trainable parameters from 41.8 million
to approximately nine thousand, achieving superior performance with faster
training and lower memory usage. We also introduce the GAN as a diagnostic tool
for experimental and labeling quality. When trained on high-quality images, the
GAN learns the characteristics of optimal imaging; deviations between its
generated outputs and new experimental images can reveal issues such as
photobleaching, artifacts, or inaccurate labeling. This establishes the model
as a practical tool for validating experimental accuracy and image fidelity in
microscopy workflows.

TL;DR: 提出结合光流(COF)方法，整合微表情的起始到峰值和峰值到结束两个阶段，以提升微表情识别的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数基于光流的微表情识别方法只关注起始到峰值阶段，忽略了峰值到结束阶段的关键时间动态信息。

Method: 引入结合光流(COF)方法，整合微表情的起始到峰值和峰值到结束两个阶段的光流信息。

Result: 在CASMEII和SAMM数据集上的实验结果表明，COF方法优于单一光流方法。

Conclusion: COF能够更全面地捕捉微表情动态，提高微表情识别性能。

Abstract: Facial micro-expressions are brief, involuntary facial movements that reveal
hidden emotions. Most Micro-Expression Recognition (MER) methods that rely on
optical flow typically focus on the onset-to-apex phase, neglecting the
apex-to-offset phase, which holds key temporal dynamics. This study introduces
a Combined Optical Flow (COF), integrating both phases to enhance feature
representation. COF provides a more comprehensive motion analysis, improving
MER performance. Experimental results on CASMEII and SAMM datasets show that
COF outperforms single optical flow-based methods, demonstrating its
effectiveness in capturing micro-expression dynamics.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel dataset aimed at detecting pedestrians'
intentions as they approach an ego-vehicle. The dataset comprises synchronized
multi-modal data, including fisheye camera feeds, lidar laser scans, ultrasonic
sensor readings, and motion capture-based 3D body poses, collected across
diverse real-world scenarios. Key contributions include detailed annotations of

real-world challenges such as sensor occlusions, dynamic environments, and
hardware constraints, this dataset offers a unique resource for developing and
evaluating state-of-the-art algorithms in pedestrian detection, 3D pose
estimation and 4D trajectory and intention prediction. Additionally, we provide

Motivation: 植物3D表型分析对于理解植物生长、产量预测和疾病控制至关重要，但环境风和无人机下洗气流造成的叶片运动给重建带来挑战。

Method: 使用小型商用无人机自主采集图像，通过迭代方法估计叶片运动（使用光流），逐步调整输入图像以减少场景运动，生成规范表示。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一个公开的3D重建管道源代码和包含多种作物在不同时间点采集的数据集，为植物3D表型分析研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: 3D phenotyping of plants plays a crucial role for understanding plant growth,
yield prediction, and disease control. We present a pipeline capable of
generating high-quality 3D reconstructions of individual agricultural plants.
To acquire data, a small commercially available UAV captures images of a
selected plant. Apart from placing ArUco markers, the entire image acquisition
process is fully autonomous, controlled by a self-developed Android application
running on the drone's controller. The reconstruction task is particularly
challenging due to environmental wind and downwash of the UAV. Our proposed
pipeline supports the integration of arbitrary state-of-the-art 3D
reconstruction methods. To mitigate errors caused by leaf motion during image
capture, we use an iterative method that gradually adjusts the input images
through deformation. Motion is estimated using optical flow between the
original input images and intermediate 3D reconstructions rendered from the
corresponding viewpoints. This alignment gradually reduces scene motion,
resulting in a canonical representation. After a few iterations, our pipeline
improves the reconstruction of state-of-the-art methods and enables the
extraction of high-resolution 3D meshes. We will publicly release the source
code of our reconstruction pipeline. Additionally, we provide a dataset
consisting of multiple plants from various crops, captured across different
points in time.

Motivation: 解决脑肿瘤分割中标注数据有限、成本高、不一致的问题，提供可扩展的无监督解决方案。

Method: 使用多模态视觉Transformer自编码器，仅用健康脑部MRI训练，通过重建误差图检测肿瘤；采用多模态早期-晚期融合策略和集成Segment Anything Model的后处理流程。

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的无监督模型有潜力成为神经肿瘤影像学的可扩展、标签高效工具。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) presents a complementary alternative to
supervised learning for brain tumor segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI), particularly when annotated datasets are limited, costly, or
inconsistent. In this work, we propose a novel Multimodal Vision Transformer
Autoencoder (MViT-AE) trained exclusively on healthy brain MRIs to detect and
localize tumors via reconstruction-based error maps. This unsupervised paradigm
enables segmentation without reliance on manual labels, addressing a key
scalability bottleneck in neuroimaging workflows. Our method is evaluated in
the BraTS-GoAT 2025 Lighthouse dataset, which includes various types of tumors
such as gliomas, meningiomas, and pediatric brain tumors. To enhance
performance, we introduce a multimodal early-late fusion strategy that
leverages complementary information across multiple MRI sequences, and a
post-processing pipeline that integrates the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to
refine predicted tumor contours. Despite the known challenges of UAD,
particularly in detecting small or non-enhancing lesions, our method achieves
clinically meaningful tumor localization, with lesion-wise Dice Similarity
Coefficient of 0.437 (Whole Tumor), 0.316 (Tumor Core), and 0.350 (Enhancing
Tumor) on the test set, and an anomaly Detection Rate of 89.4% on the
validation set. These findings highlight the potential of transformer-based
unsupervised models to serve as scalable, label-efficient tools for
neuro-oncological imaging.

Motivation: 解决低光RAW图像增强中同时实现强增强质量和高效性的挑战，克服现有方法在两阶段框架中的模糊性问题。

Method: 采用分层混合架构HiMA，结合Transformer处理大尺度特征和Mamba处理小尺度特征；提出LoDA模块进行局部分布调整；设计MPF模块融合空间和频域先验。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有最先进方法，以更少参数实现更优性能。

Conclusion: HiMA框架通过分层混合架构和局部调整机制，有效解决了低光RAW图像增强中的效率和质量平衡问题。

Abstract: Low-light RAW image enhancement remains a challenging task. Although numerous
deep learning based approaches have been proposed, they still suffer from
inherent limitations. A key challenge is how to simultaneously achieve strong
enhancement quality and high efficiency. In this paper, we rethink the
architecture for efficient low-light image signal processing (ISP) and
introduce a Hierarchical Mixing Architecture (HiMA). HiMA leverages the
complementary strengths of Transformer and Mamba modules to handle features at
large and small scales, respectively, thereby improving efficiency while
avoiding the ambiguities observed in prior two-stage frameworks. To further
address uneven illumination with strong local variations, we propose Local
Distribution Adjustment (LoDA), which adaptively aligns feature distributions
across different local regions. In addition, to fully exploit the denoised
outputs from the first stage, we design a Multi-prior Fusion (MPF) module that
integrates spatial and frequency-domain priors for detail enhancement.
Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior performance with
fewer parameters. Code will be released at https://github.com/Cynicarlos/HiMA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了DGME-T方法，通过注入方向性网格运动编码来增强Video Swin Transformer在档案影片相机运动分类中的性能，特别是在噪声和低质量视频上表现更鲁棒。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有相机运动分类模型在档案影片（如二战影片）上性能下降的问题，这些影片存在噪声、缺失帧和低对比度等挑战。

Method: 构建统一基准数据集，并提出了DGME-T方法——在Video Swin Transformer基础上通过可学习的后期融合层注入基于光流的方向性网格运动编码。

Result: 在现代视频上，top-1准确率从81.78%提升到86.14%，宏F1从82.08%提升到87.81%；在二战档案影片上，准确率从83.43%提升到84.62%，宏F1从81.72%提升到82.63%。跨域研究显示中间微调可提升历史数据性能5个百分点以上。

Conclusion: 结构化运动先验与Transformer表示具有互补性，即使小的精心校准的运动头也能显著增强在退化影片分析中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Camera movement classification (CMC) models trained on contemporary,
high-quality footage often degrade when applied to archival film, where noise,
missing frames, and low contrast obscure motion cues. We bridge this gap by
assembling a unified benchmark that consolidates two modern corpora into four
canonical classes and restructures the HISTORIAN collection into five balanced
categories. Building on this benchmark, we introduce DGME-T, a lightweight
extension to the Video Swin Transformer that injects directional grid motion
encoding, derived from optical flow, via a learnable and normalised late-fusion
layer. DGME-T raises the backbone's top-1 accuracy from 81.78% to 86.14% and
its macro F1 from 82.08% to 87.81% on modern clips, while still improving the
demanding World-War-II footage from 83.43% to 84.62% accuracy and from 81.72%
to 82.63% macro F1. A cross-domain study further shows that an intermediate
fine-tuning stage on modern data increases historical performance by more than
five percentage points. These results demonstrate that structured motion priors
and transformer representations are complementary and that even a small,
carefully calibrated motion head can substantially enhance robustness in
degraded film analysis. Related resources are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了NDM框架，首个基于噪声的检测和缓解方法，用于处理文本到图像生成中的隐式恶意意图，同时保持模型生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型在面对隐式性暗示提示时容易生成不当内容，现有检测方法主要针对显式内容，而微调方法会降低生成质量。

Method: 利用早期预测噪声的可分离性开发噪声检测方法，并提出噪声增强的自适应负引导机制来优化初始噪声。

Result: 在自然和对抗数据集上验证，NDM性能优于现有SOTA方法（SLD、UCE、RECE等）。

Conclusion: NDM框架能有效检测和缓解隐式恶意意图，同时保持模型的原始生成能力。

Abstract: Despite the impressive generative capabilities of text-to-image (T2I)
diffusion models, they remain vulnerable to generating inappropriate content,
especially when confronted with implicit sexual prompts. Unlike explicit
harmful prompts, these subtle cues, often disguised as seemingly benign terms,
can unexpectedly trigger sexual content due to underlying model biases, raising
significant ethical concerns. However, existing detection methods are primarily
designed to identify explicit sexual content and therefore struggle to detect
these implicit cues. Fine-tuning approaches, while effective to some extent,
risk degrading the model's generative quality, creating an undesirable
trade-off. To address this, we propose NDM, the first noise-driven detection
and mitigation framework, which could detect and mitigate implicit malicious
intention in T2I generation while preserving the model's original generative
capabilities. Specifically, we introduce two key innovations: first, we
leverage the separability of early-stage predicted noise to develop a
noise-based detection method that could identify malicious content with high
accuracy and efficiency; second, we propose a noise-enhanced adaptive negative
guidance mechanism that could optimize the initial noise by suppressing the
prominent region's attention, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of adaptive
negative guidance for sexual mitigation. Experimentally, we validate NDM on
both natural and adversarial datasets, demonstrating its superior performance
over existing SOTA methods, including SLD, UCE, and RECE, etc. Code and
resources are available at https://github.com/lorraine021/NDM.

TL;DR: 提出LFA方法，无需属性标签即可通过潜在方向识别人脸识别模型中的偏差子群体，相比传统聚类方法在语义一致性和可解释性方面表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代人脸识别模型虽然整体准确率高，但仍存在系统性偏差，传统基于标注属性的偏差评估框架成本高且受限于预定义类别。

Method: 引入潜在特征对齐(LFA)算法，使用潜在方向识别子群体，实现语义一致的聚类和可解释方向发现。

Result: 在四种最先进识别模型和两个基准测试中，LFA在组内语义一致性上持续优于k-means和最近邻搜索，并发现了与人口统计和上下文属性对齐的可解释潜在方向。

Conclusion: LFA可作为人脸识别模型表示审计的实用方法，使从业者能够在没有预定义属性标注的情况下识别和解释偏差子群体。

Abstract: Modern face recognition models achieve high overall accuracy but continue to
exhibit systematic biases that disproportionately affect certain
subpopulations. Conventional bias evaluation frameworks rely on labeled
attributes to form subpopulations, which are expensive to obtain and limited to
predefined categories. We introduce Latent Feature Alignment (LFA), an
attribute-label-free algorithm that uses latent directions to identify
subpopulations. This yields two main benefits over standard clustering: (i)
semantically coherent grouping, where faces sharing common attributes are
grouped together more reliably than by proximity-based methods, and (ii)
discovery of interpretable directions, which correspond to semantic attributes
such as age, ethnicity, or attire. Across four state-of-the-art recognition
models (ArcFace, CosFace, ElasticFace, PartialFC) and two benchmarks (RFW,
CelebA), LFA consistently outperforms k-means and nearest-neighbor search in
intra-group semantic coherence, while uncovering interpretable latent
directions aligned with demographic and contextual attributes. These results
position LFA as a practical method for representation auditing of face
recognition models, enabling practitioners to identify and interpret biased
subpopulations without predefined attribute annotations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当获取精细像素级标注困难或昂贵时，粗标注（如粗略标注像素，边界处不标注）成为替代方案，但边界对齐效果不佳

Method: 在编码器-解码器架构中引入基于超像素的上采样正则化，强制解码图像中的分割像素形成SLIC超像素（基于颜色和位置）

Result: 在SUIM、Cityscapes和PanNuke数据集上评估，相比最先进模型，边界召回率显著提升

Conclusion: 该方法在粗标注条件下有效改善语义分割的边界对齐性能

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is the task of classifying each pixel in an image.
Training a segmentation model achieves best results using annotated images,
where each pixel is annotated with the corresponding class. When obtaining fine
annotations is difficult or expensive, it may be possible to acquire coarse
annotations, e.g. by roughly annotating pixels in an images leaving some pixels
around the boundaries between classes unlabeled. Segmentation with coarse
annotations is difficult, in particular when the objective is to optimize the
alignment of boundaries between classes. This paper proposes a regularization
method for models with an encoder-decoder architecture with superpixel based
upsampling. It encourages the segmented pixels in the decoded image to be
SLIC-superpixels, which are based on pixel color and position, independent of
the segmentation annotation. The method is applied to FCN-16 fully
convolutional network architecture and evaluated on the SUIM, Cityscapes, and
PanNuke data sets. It is shown that the boundary recall improves significantly
compared to state-of-the-art models when trained on coarse annotations.

Abstract: This work presents a systematic investigation of custom convolutional neural
network architectures for satellite land use classification, achieving 97.23%
test accuracy on the EuroSAT dataset without reliance on pre-trained models.
Through three progressive architectural iterations (baseline: 94.30%,
CBAM-enhanced: 95.98%, and balanced multi-task attention: 97.23%) we identify
and address specific failure modes in satellite imagery classification. Our
principal contribution is a novel balanced multi-task attention mechanism that
combines Coordinate Attention for spatial feature extraction with
Squeeze-Excitation blocks for spectral feature extraction, unified through a
learnable fusion parameter. Experimental results demonstrate that this
learnable parameter autonomously converges to alpha approximately 0.57,
indicating near-equal importance of spatial and spectral modalities for
satellite imagery. We employ progressive DropBlock regularization (5-20% by
network depth) and class-balanced loss weighting to address overfitting and
confusion pattern imbalance. The final 12-layer architecture achieves Cohen's
Kappa of 0.9692 with all classes exceeding 94.46% accuracy, demonstrating
confidence calibration with a 24.25% gap between correct and incorrect
predictions. Our approach achieves performance within 1.34% of fine-tuned
ResNet-50 (98.57%) while requiring no external data, validating the efficacy of
systematic architectural design for domain-specific applications. Complete
code, trained models, and evaluation scripts are publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FDG-PET在痴呆症诊断中效果显著，但相比常规MRI更昂贵且不易获取。研究旨在开发一种从MRI生成模拟PET图像的方法，使PET的诊断优势在资源有限环境中更易获得。

Method: 使用3D扩散桥框架学习从MRI和患者信息到FDG-PET图像的概率映射，生成诊断质量的模拟PET图像。

Result: 在盲法临床研究中，SiM2P将三组（阿尔茨海默病、行为变异型额颞叶痴呆、认知健康对照）的总体诊断准确率从75.0%提高到84.7%，模拟PET图像获得更高的诊断确定性评分和更好的评估者间一致性。

Conclusion: SiM2P框架仅需20例站点特定病例和基本人口统计学信息即可部署，使FDG-PET的诊断优势更易获得，有望改善资源有限环境中的早期检测和鉴别诊断。

Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is an
established tool in the diagnostic workup of patients with suspected dementing
disorders. However, compared to the routinely available magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), FDG-PET remains significantly less accessible and substantially
more expensive. Here, we present SiM2P, a 3D diffusion bridge-based framework
that learns a probabilistic mapping from MRI and auxiliary patient information
to simulate FDG-PET images of diagnostic quality. In a blinded clinical reader
study, two neuroradiologists and two nuclear medicine physicians rated the
original MRI and SiM2P-simulated PET images of patients with Alzheimer's
disease, behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia, and cognitively healthy
controls. SiM2P significantly improved the overall diagnostic accuracy of
differentiating between three groups from 75.0% to 84.7% (p<0.05). Notably, the
simulated PET images received higher diagnostic certainty ratings and achieved
superior interrater agreement compared to the MRI images. Finally, we developed
a practical workflow for local deployment of the SiM2P framework. It requires
as few as 20 site-specific cases and only basic demographic information. This
approach makes the established diagnostic benefits of FDG-PET imaging more
accessible to patients with suspected dementing disorders, potentially
improving early detection and differential diagnosis in resource-limited
settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yiiitong/SiM2P.

Motivation: 推动机器智能需要发展像人类一样感知多模态世界的能力，因此需要构建强大的开源多模态大语言模型。

Method: 提出三个关键创新：OmniAlignNet增强视觉和音频嵌入在多模态潜在空间中的对齐；Temporal Embedding Grouping捕捉视觉和音频信号的相对时间对齐；Constrained Rotary Time Embedding在多模态嵌入中编码绝对时间信息。同时构建了生成2400万单模态和多模态对话的数据管道。

Conclusion: 多模态在感知和推理中相互增强，OmniVinci展示了在机器人、医疗AI和智能工厂等下游应用中的多模态优势。

Abstract: Advancing machine intelligence requires developing the ability to perceive
across multiple modalities, much as humans sense the world. We introduce
OmniVinci, an initiative to build a strong, open-source, omni-modal LLM. We
carefully study the design choices across model architecture and data curation.
For model architecture, we present three key innovations: (i) OmniAlignNet for
strengthening alignment between vision and audio embeddings in a shared
omni-modal latent space; (ii) Temporal Embedding Grouping for capturing
relative temporal alignment between vision and audio signals; and (iii)
Constrained Rotary Time Embedding for encoding absolute temporal information in
omni-modal embeddings. We introduce a curation and synthesis pipeline that
generates 24M single-modal and omni-modal conversations. We find that
modalities reinforce one another in both perception and reasoning. Our model,
OmniVinci, outperforms Qwen2.5-Omni with +19.05 on DailyOmni (cross-modal
understanding), +1.7 on MMAR (audio), and +3.9 on Video-MME (vision), while
using just 0.2T training tokens - a 6 times reduction compared to
Qwen2.5-Omni's 1.2T. We finally demonstrate omni-modal advantages in downstream
applications spanning robotics, medical AI, and smart factory.

Abstract: Generating artistic and coherent 3D scene layouts is crucial in digital
content creation. Traditional optimization-based methods are often constrained
by cumbersome manual rules, while deep generative models face challenges in
producing content with richness and diversity. Furthermore, approaches that
utilize large language models frequently lack robustness and fail to accurately
capture complex spatial relationships. To address these challenges, this paper
presents a novel vision-guided 3D layout generation system. We first construct
a high-quality asset library containing 2,037 scene assets and 147 3D scene
layouts. Subsequently, we employ an image generation model to expand prompt
representations into images, fine-tuning it to align with our asset library. We
then develop a robust image parsing module to recover the 3D layout of scenes
based on visual semantics and geometric information. Finally, we optimize the
scene layout using scene graphs and overall visual semantics to ensure logical
coherence and alignment with the images. Extensive user testing demonstrates
that our algorithm significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of
layout richness and quality. The code and dataset will be available at

Conclusion: 多视角融合方法能够有效提升DeepFake检测的鲁棒性，特别是在面对姿态变化和复杂光照条件时表现优异。

Abstract: DeepFake technology has advanced significantly in recent years, enabling the
creation of highly realistic synthetic face images. Existing DeepFake detection
methods often struggle with pose variations, occlusions, and artifacts that are
difficult to detect in real-world conditions. To address these challenges, we
propose a multi-view architecture that enhances DeepFake detection by analyzing
facial features at multiple levels. Our approach integrates three specialized
encoders, a global view encoder for detecting boundary inconsistencies, a
middle view encoder for analyzing texture and color alignment, and a local view
encoder for capturing distortions in expressive facial regions such as the
eyes, nose, and mouth, where DeepFake artifacts frequently occur. Additionally,
we incorporate a face orientation encoder, trained to classify face poses,
ensuring robust detection across various viewing angles. By fusing features
from these encoders, our model achieves superior performance in detecting
manipulated images, even under challenging pose and lighting
conditions.Experimental results on challenging datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method, outperforming conventional single-view approaches

Motivation: 为了促进时空图像融合方法的应用，需要解决不同传感器图像空间和光谱分辨率不匹配的问题。

Method: 比较了两种标准化方法：1）传统上采样方法；2）ABSIS锐化方法，该方法将精细分辨率图像的整体特征与特定粗分辨率图像的独特属性融合。

Result: 两种方法都显著提高了USTFIP方法的准确性，其中锐化方法使融合图像的光谱和空间精度分别提高了49.46%和78.40%。

Conclusion: 提出的标准化方法特别是ABSIS锐化方法，能够有效改善时空图像融合的性能，为实际应用提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Image Fusion (STIF) methods usually require sets of images
with matching spatial and spectral resolutions captured by different sensors.
To facilitate the application of STIF methods, we propose and compare two
different standardization approaches. The first method is based on traditional
upscaling of the fine-resolution images. The second method is a sharpening
approach called Anomaly Based Satellite Image Standardization (ABSIS) that
blends the overall features found in the fine-resolution image series with the
distinctive attributes of a specific coarse-resolution image to produce images
that more closely resemble the outcome of aggregating the fine-resolution
images. Both methods produce a significant increase in accuracy of the Unpaired
Spatio Temporal Fusion of Image Patches (USTFIP) STIF method, with the
sharpening approach increasing the spectral and spatial accuracies of the fused
images by up to 49.46\% and 78.40\%, respectively.

Conclusion: FlexiReID框架有效解决了多模态行人重识别的灵活性需求，为实际应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to match pedestrian images
across different modalities. However, most existing methods focus on limited
cross-modal settings and fail to support arbitrary query-retrieval
combinations, hindering practical deployment. We propose FlexiReID, a flexible
framework that supports seven retrieval modes across four modalities: rgb,
infrared, sketches, and text. FlexiReID introduces an adaptive
mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanism to dynamically integrate diverse modality
features and a cross-modal query fusion module to enhance multimodal feature
extraction. To facilitate comprehensive evaluation, we construct CIRS-PEDES, a
unified dataset extending four popular Re-ID datasets to include all four
modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlexiReID achieves
state-of-the-art performance and offers strong generalization in complex
scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一种实时纹理异常定位方法QFCA，通过量化特征对应分析实现10倍加速，同时保持精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有纹理异常定位方法运行时间过长，难以在实际场景（如生产线监控）中部署，需要开发实时解决方案。

Result: 在保持精度的同时实现了10倍加速，在复杂纹理上提高了检测精度。

Conclusion: QFCA方法在速度和精度方面均优于现有方法，适合实际部署应用。

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly localization is a rising field in computer vision research,
with important progress in recent years. This work focuses on the problem of
detecting and localizing anomalies in textures, where anomalies can be defined
as the regions that deviate from the overall statistics, violating the
stationarity assumption. The main limitation of existing methods is their high
running time, making them impractical for deployment in real-world scenarios,
such as assembly line monitoring. We propose a real-time method, named QFCA,
which implements a quantized version of the feature correspondence analysis
(FCA) algorithm. By carefully adapting the patch statistics comparison to work
on histograms of quantized values, we obtain a 10x speedup with little to no
loss in accuracy. Moreover, we introduce a feature preprocessing step based on
principal component analysis, which enhances the contrast between normal and
anomalous features, improving the detection precision on complex textures. Our
method is thoroughly evaluated against prior art, comparing favorably with
existing methods. Project page:

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Noise2Detail的超轻量级自监督去噪模型，在保持高质量图像恢复的同时实现了快速去噪，解决了现有方法计算和内存需求大的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自监督去噪技术在真实应用中受到计算和内存需求的限制，需要在推理速度和重建质量之间做出妥协，特别是在生物医学成像等缺乏干净训练数据的领域。

Method: 基于Noise2Noise训练框架，引入创新的多阶段去噪流程Noise2Detail：在推理过程中破坏噪声模式的空间相关性产生中间平滑结构，然后从噪声输入中重新捕捉精细细节。

Result: 广泛测试表明Noise2Detail在性能上超越了现有的无数据集技术，同时仅需少量计算资源，实现了效率、低计算成本和无数据方法的结合。

Conclusion: 该模型是生物医学成像的宝贵工具，克服了由于罕见和复杂成像模式导致的干净训练数据稀缺的挑战，同时实现了实际应用所需的快速推理。

Abstract: Current self-supervised denoising techniques achieve impressive results, yet
their real-world application is frequently constrained by substantial
computational and memory demands, necessitating a compromise between inference
speed and reconstruction quality. In this paper, we present an
ultra-lightweight model that addresses this challenge, achieving both fast
denoising and high quality image restoration. Built upon the Noise2Noise
training framework-which removes the reliance on clean reference images or
explicit noise modeling-we introduce an innovative multistage denoising
pipeline named Noise2Detail (N2D). During inference, this approach disrupts the
spatial correlations of noise patterns to produce intermediate smooth
structures, which are subsequently refined to recapture fine details directly
from the noisy input. Extensive testing reveals that Noise2Detail surpasses
existing dataset-free techniques in performance, while requiring only a
fraction of the computational resources. This combination of efficiency, low
computational cost, and data-free approach make it a valuable tool for
biomedical imaging, overcoming the challenges of scarce clean training data-due
to rare and complex imaging modalities-while enabling fast inference for
practical use.

Abstract: Domain adaptation is a crucial and increasingly important task in remote
sensing, aiming to transfer knowledge from a source domain a differently
distributed target domain. It has broad applications across various real-world
applications, including remote sensing element interpretation, ecological
environment monitoring, and urban/rural planning. However, domain adaptation in
remote sensing poses significant challenges due to differences in data, such as
variations in ground sampling distance, imaging modes from various sensors,
geographical landscapes, and environmental conditions. In recent years, deep
learning has emerged as a powerful tool for feature representation and
cross-domain knowledge transfer, leading to widespread adoption in remote
sensing tasks. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of significant
advancements in deep learning based domain adaptation for remote sensing. We
first introduce the preliminary knowledge to clarify key concepts, mathematical
notations, and the taxonomy of methodologies. We then organize existing
algorithms from multiple perspectives, including task categorization, input
mode, supervision paradigm, and algorithmic granularity, providing readers with
a structured understanding of the field. Next, we review widely used datasets
and summarize the performance of state-of-the-art methods to provide an
overview of current progress. We also identify open challenges and potential
directions to guide future research in domain adaptation for remote sensing.
Compared to previous surveys, this work addresses a broader range of domain
adaptation tasks in remote sensing, rather than concentrating on a few
subfields. It also presents a systematic taxonomy, providing a more
comprehensive and organized understanding of the field. As a whole, this survey
can inspire the research community, foster understanding, and guide future work
in the field.

TL;DR: 提出一种弱监督医学图像分割框架，仅需四个极值点标注，通过SAM2生成初始伪标签，结合改进的FGEPM算法和不确定性估计进行边界追踪，在超声图像数据集上达到与全监督方法相当甚至更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全监督医学图像分割需要大量像素级标注，成本高且耗时。为减轻标注负担，探索仅使用极值点标注的弱监督方法。

Method: 使用极值点生成边界框作为SAM2提示，生成初始伪标签；改进FGEPM算法结合蒙特卡洛dropout不确定性估计构建梯度不确定性代价图进行边界追踪；引入双分支不确定性感知尺度一致性损失和框对齐损失确保空间一致性和边界对齐。

Result: 在BUSI和UNS两个公开超声数据集上的实验表明，该方法性能与全监督方法相当甚至更好，同时显著降低标注成本。

Conclusion: 提出的弱监督框架在超声图像分割中具有有效性和实用性，为医学图像分析提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Automatic medical image segmentation is a fundamental step in computer-aided
diagnosis, yet fully supervised approaches demand extensive pixel-level
annotations that are costly and time-consuming. To alleviate this burden, we
propose a weakly supervised segmentation framework that leverages only four
extreme points as annotation. Specifically, bounding boxes derived from the
extreme points are used as prompts for the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) to
generate reliable initial pseudo labels. These pseudo labels are progressively
refined by an enhanced Feature-Guided Extreme Point Masking (FGEPM) algorithm,
which incorporates Monte Carlo dropout-based uncertainty estimation to
construct a unified gradient uncertainty cost map for boundary tracing.
Furthermore, a dual-branch Uncertainty-aware Scale Consistency (USC) loss and a
box alignment loss are introduced to ensure spatial consistency and precise
boundary alignment during training. Extensive experiments on two public
ultrasound datasets, BUSI and UNS, demonstrate that our method achieves
performance comparable to, and even surpassing fully supervised counterparts
while significantly reducing annotation cost. These results validate the
effectiveness and practicality of the proposed weakly supervised framework for
ultrasound image segmentation.

Motivation: 现有医学AI系统破坏了统一诊断流程：图像理解模型无法生成视觉输出，图像生成模型无法提供文本解释，导致数据表示、特征集成和多模态能力的差距。

Method: 采用观察-知识-分析(OKA)范式：观察层构建UniMed-5M数据集；知识层提出渐进式课程学习；分析层开发UniMedVL统一多模态模型。

Result: 在5个医学图像理解基准测试中表现优异，在8种医学成像模态的生成质量上与专用模型相当，双向知识共享提升了视觉理解特征。

Conclusion: 在单一医学框架中整合传统分离的能力，能够解锁跨多样化医学视觉语言任务的改进，实现图像理解和生成任务的协同提升。

Abstract: Medical diagnostic applications require models that can process multimodal
medical inputs (images, patient histories, lab results) and generate diverse
outputs including both textual reports and visual content (annotations,
segmentation masks, and images). Despite this need, existing medical AI systems
disrupt this unified process: medical image understanding models interpret
images but cannot generate visual outputs, while medical image generation
models synthesize images but cannot provide textual explanations. This leads to
gaps in data representation, feature integration, and task-level multimodal
capabilities. To this end, we propose a multi-level framework that draws
inspiration from diagnostic workflows through the
Observation-Knowledge-Analysis (OKA) paradigm. Specifically, at the observation
level, we construct UniMed-5M, a dataset comprising over 5.6M samples that
reformat diverse unimodal data into multimodal pairs for foundational
observation. At the knowledge level, we propose Progressive Curriculum Learning
that systematically introduces medical multimodal knowledge. At the analysis
level, we introduce UniMedVL, the first medical unified multimodal model for
the simultaneous analysis of image understanding and generation tasks within a
single architecture. UniMedVL achieves superior performance on five medical
image understanding benchmarks, while matching specialized models in generation
quality across eight medical imaging modalities. Crucially, our unified
architecture enables bidirectional knowledge sharing: generation tasks enhance
visual understanding features, demonstrating that integrating traditionally
separate capabilities within a single medical framework unlocks improvements
across diverse medical vision-language tasks. Code is available at

Abstract: Instruction-based video editing promises to democratize content creation, yet
its progress is severely hampered by the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality
training data. We introduce Ditto, a holistic framework designed to tackle this
fundamental challenge. At its heart, Ditto features a novel data generation
pipeline that fuses the creative diversity of a leading image editor with an
in-context video generator, overcoming the limited scope of existing models. To
make this process viable, our framework resolves the prohibitive cost-quality
trade-off by employing an efficient, distilled model architecture augmented by
a temporal enhancer, which simultaneously reduces computational overhead and
improves temporal coherence. Finally, to achieve full scalability, this entire
pipeline is driven by an intelligent agent that crafts diverse instructions and
rigorously filters the output, ensuring quality control at scale. Using this
framework, we invested over 12,000 GPU-days to build Ditto-1M, a new dataset of
one million high-fidelity video editing examples. We trained our model, Editto,
on Ditto-1M with a curriculum learning strategy. The results demonstrate
superior instruction-following ability and establish a new state-of-the-art in

Method: 采用分层推理框架：粗粒度模块初步估计布局结果，精炼模块进行细粒度推理，并融入布局设计原则作为先验知识

Result: 在多个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能

Conclusion: SEGA方法通过分步进化范式有效提升了内容感知布局生成的质量和可靠性

Abstract: In this paper, we study the content-aware layout generation problem, which
aims to automatically generate layouts that are harmonious with a given
background image. Existing methods usually deal with this task with a
single-step reasoning framework. The lack of a feedback-based self-correction
mechanism leads to their failure rates significantly increasing when faced with
complex element layout planning. To address this challenge, we introduce SEGA,
a novel Stepwise Evolution Paradigm for Content-Aware Layout Generation.
Inspired by the systematic mode of human thinking, SEGA employs a hierarchical
reasoning framework with a coarse-to-fine strategy: first, a coarse-level
module roughly estimates the layout planning results; then, another refining
module performs fine-level reasoning regarding the coarse planning results.
Furthermore, we incorporate layout design principles as prior knowledge into
the model to enhance its layout planning ability. Besides, we present
GenPoster-100K that is a new large-scale poster dataset with rich
meta-information annotation. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach by achieving the state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmark
datasets. Our project page is at: https://brucew91.github.io/SEGA.github.io/

Motivation: 解决潜在扩散模型中高频细节保真度不足和罕见激活尖峰问题，提供无需训练的稳定解决方案。

Method: 结合每样本微钳位技术和自适应分位数裁剪(AQClip)，AQClip可使用局部结构统计或注意力熵指导模式，集成到CADE 2.5渲染管线中。

Result: 在低步数和超高分辨率下获得更清晰、更锐利的结果，与CFG/Rescale有协同效应，能承受更高引导而不产生伪影。

Conclusion: QSilk为SD/SDXL骨干网络提供一致的定性改进，具有可忽略的开销且无需用户复杂控制。

Abstract: We present QSilk, a lightweight, always-on stabilization layer for latent
diffusion that improves high-frequency fidelity while suppressing rare
activation spikes. QSilk combines (i) a per-sample micro clamp that gently
limits extreme values without washing out texture, and (ii) Adaptive Quantile
Clip (AQClip), which adapts the allowed value corridor per region. AQClip can
operate in a proxy mode using local structure statistics or in an attention
entropy guided mode (model confidence). Integrated into the CADE 2.5 rendering
pipeline, QSilk yields cleaner, sharper results at low step counts and
ultra-high resolutions with negligible overhead. It requires no training or
fine-tuning and exposes minimal user controls. We report consistent qualitative
improvements across SD/SDXL backbones and show synergy with CFG/Rescale,
enabling slightly higher guidance without artifacts.

Conclusion: 通过将概念建立在视觉证据基础上，该方法克服了先前模型的基本限制，增强了可解释AI的可靠性。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) enhance interpretability by predicting
human-understandable concepts as intermediate representations. However,
existing CBMs often suffer from input-to-concept mapping bias and limited
controllability, which restricts their practical value, directly damage the
responsibility of strategy from concept-based methods. We propose a lightweight
Disentangled Concept Bottleneck Model (LDCBM) that automatically groups visual
features into semantically meaningful components without region annotation. By
introducing a filter grouping loss and joint concept supervision, our method
improves the alignment between visual patterns and concepts, enabling more
transparent and robust decision-making. Notably, Experiments on three diverse
datasets demonstrate that LDCBM achieves higher concept and class accuracy,
outperforming previous CBMs in both interpretability and classification
performance. By grounding concepts in visual evidence, our method overcomes a
fundamental limitation of prior models and enhances the reliability of
interpretable AI.

Abstract: The scale and quality of datasets are crucial for training robust perception
models. However, obtaining large-scale annotated data is both costly and
time-consuming. Generative models have emerged as a powerful tool for data
augmentation by synthesizing samples that adhere to desired distributions.
However, current generative approaches often rely on complex post-processing or
extensive fine-tuning on massive datasets to achieve satisfactory results, and
they remain prone to content-position mismatches and semantic leakage. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce ReCon, a novel augmentation framework
that enhances the capacity of structure-controllable generative models for
object detection. ReCon integrates region-guided rectification into the
diffusion sampling process, using feedback from a pre-trained perception model
to rectify misgenerated regions within diffusion sampling process. We further
propose region-aligned cross-attention to enforce spatial-semantic alignment
between image regions and their textual cues, thereby improving both semantic
consistency and overall image fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ReCon substantially improve the quality and trainability of generated data,
achieving consistent performance gains across various datasets, backbone
architectures, and data scales. Our code is available at

Result: 在DeformingThings4D和D-FAUST数据集上优于先前最先进方法，相比之前最佳方法实现了4倍以上的加速

Conclusion: ERNet能够有效处理噪声和部分输入，同时利用时间信息进行准确一致的序列配准，在准确性和效率方面均有显著提升

Abstract: Registering an object shape to a sequence of point clouds undergoing
non-rigid deformation is a long-standing challenge. The key difficulties stem
from two factors: (i) the presence of local minima due to the non-convexity of
registration objectives, especially under noisy or partial inputs, which
hinders accurate and robust deformation estimation, and (ii) error accumulation
over long sequences, leading to tracking failures. To address these challenges,
we introduce to adopt a scalable data-driven approach and propose ERNet, an
efficient feed-forward model trained on large deformation datasets. It is
designed to handle noisy and partial inputs while effectively leveraging
temporal information for accurate and consistent sequential registration. The
key to our design is predicting a sequence of deformation graphs through a
two-stage pipeline, which first estimates frame-wise coarse graph nodes for
robust initialization, before refining their trajectories over time in a
sliding-window fashion. Extensive experiments show that our proposed approach
(i) outperforms previous state-of-the-art on both the DeformingThings4D and
D-FAUST datasets, and (ii) achieves more than 4x speedup compared to the
previous best, offering significant efficiency improvement.

TL;DR: VISTA是一个多智能体系统，通过迭代循环自动改进视频生成质量。它将用户想法分解为结构化时间计划，通过成对锦标赛选择最佳视频，然后由专门智能体进行视觉、音频和上下文保真度评估，最后通过推理智能体综合反馈来重写和增强提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到视频合成方法严重依赖精确的用户提示，而其他领域的测试时优化方法难以应对视频的多方面特性。需要一种能够自动改进视频生成质量的系统。

Method: VISTA采用多智能体架构：1）将用户想法分解为结构化时间计划；2）通过成对锦标赛选择最佳视频；3）专门智能体评估视觉、音频和上下文保真度；4）推理智能体综合反馈并重写提示，形成迭代循环。

Result: 在单场景和多场景视频生成实验中，VISTA相比现有方法能持续改进视频质量和用户意图对齐，达到60%的成对胜率。人类评估者在66.4%的比较中更偏好VISTA输出。

Conclusion: VISTA通过多智能体迭代优化方法，能够有效提升视频生成质量和对齐用户意图，在自动视频改进方面表现出色。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in text-to-video synthesis, generated video quality
remains critically dependent on precise user prompts. Existing test-time
optimization methods, successful in other domains, struggle with the
multi-faceted nature of video. In this work, we introduce VISTA (Video
Iterative Self-improvemenT Agent), a novel multi-agent system that autonomously
improves video generation through refining prompts in an iterative loop. VISTA
first decomposes a user idea into a structured temporal plan. After generation,
the best video is identified through a robust pairwise tournament. This winning
video is then critiqued by a trio of specialized agents focusing on visual,
audio, and contextual fidelity. Finally, a reasoning agent synthesizes this
feedback to introspectively rewrite and enhance the prompt for the next
generation cycle. Experiments on single- and multi-scene video generation
scenarios show that while prior methods yield inconsistent gains, VISTA
consistently improves video quality and alignment with user intent, achieving
up to 60% pairwise win rate against state-of-the-art baselines. Human
evaluators concur, preferring VISTA outputs in 66.4% of comparisons.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RelateSeg首次在开放词汇语义分割中引入神经符号空间推理，通过一阶逻辑约束解决传统视觉语言模型缺乏空间关系理解的问题，在多个基准数据集上取得最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于视觉语言模型的开放词汇语义分割方法缺乏对场景中物体空间关系的理解，导致分割效果受限。

Method: 提出RelateSeg方法，自动提取空间关系并编码为一阶逻辑公式，同时预测语义类别和空间伪类别，通过模糊逻辑松弛在深度网络中实现端到端学习。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上获得平均mIoU的最先进性能，特别是在包含多个类别的图像上表现优势，仅引入单个辅助损失函数且无额外参数。

Conclusion: 神经符号空间推理在开放词汇语义分割中具有有效性，RelateSeg方法通过显式空间关系约束显著提升了分割性能。

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS) assigns pixel-level labels from
an open set of categories, requiring generalization to unseen and unlabelled
objects. Using vision-language models (VLMs) to correlate local image patches
with potential unseen object categories suffers from a lack of understanding of
spatial relations of objects in a scene. To solve this problem, we introduce
neuro-symbolic (NeSy) spatial reasoning in OVSS. In contrast to contemporary
VLM correlation-based approaches, we propose Relational Segmentor (RelateSeg)
to impose explicit spatial relational constraints by first order logic (FOL)
formulated in a neural network architecture. This is the first attempt to
explore NeSy spatial reasoning in OVSS. Specifically, RelateSeg automatically
extracts spatial relations, e.g., <cat, to-right-of, person>, and encodes them
as first-order logic formulas using our proposed pseudo categories. Each pixel
learns to predict both a semantic category (e.g., "cat") and a spatial pseudo
category (e.g., "right of person") simultaneously, enforcing relational
constraints (e.g., a "cat" pixel must lie to the right of a "person"). Finally,
these logic constraints are formulated in a deep network architecture by fuzzy
logic relaxation, enabling end-to-end learning of spatial-relationally
consistent segmentation. RelateSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance in
terms of average mIoU across four benchmark datasets and particularly shows
clear advantages on images containing multiple categories, with the cost of
only introducing a single auxiliary loss function and no additional parameters,
validating the effectiveness of NeSy spatial reasoning in OVSS.

TL;DR: 3DPR是一个基于图像的重新照明模型，利用从光阶采集的多视图单光源图像学习生成先验，结合预训练生成头部模型的几何先验，实现高质量的人脸重光照。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图形学方法通过可微分渲染将输入图像分解为几何、材质和光照，但受限于底层模型的假设和近似。需要一种能更好处理高频人脸反射分布的方法。

Method: 使用编码器将输入肖像嵌入预训练生成头部模型的潜在空间，然后通过基于三平面的反射网络合成高质量单光源图像，结合HDRI环境图实现物理准确的环境重光照。

Result: 3DPR在保持身份特征和捕捉光照效果（如镜面反射、自阴影和次表面散射）方面优于先前方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合生成先验和光阶数据，实现了高质量的人脸重光照，特别在保持身份和光照效果方面表现出色。

Abstract: Rendering novel, relit views of a human head, given a monocular portrait
image as input, is an inherently underconstrained problem. The traditional
graphics solution is to explicitly decompose the input image into geometry,
material and lighting via differentiable rendering; but this is constrained by
the multiple assumptions and approximations of the underlying models and
parameterizations of these scene components. We propose 3DPR, an image-based
relighting model that leverages generative priors learnt from multi-view
One-Light-at-A-Time (OLAT) images captured in a light stage. We introduce a new
diverse and large-scale multi-view 4K OLAT dataset of 139 subjects to learn a
high-quality prior over the distribution of high-frequency face reflectance. We
leverage the latent space of a pre-trained generative head model that provides
a rich prior over face geometry learnt from in-the-wild image datasets. The
input portrait is first embedded in the latent manifold of such a model through
an encoder-based inversion process. Then a novel triplane-based reflectance
network trained on our lightstage data is used to synthesize high-fidelity OLAT
images to enable image-based relighting. Our reflectance network operates in
the latent space of the generative head model, crucially enabling a relatively
small number of lightstage images to train the reflectance model. Combining the
generated OLATs according to a given HDRI environment maps yields physically
accurate environmental relighting results. Through quantitative and qualitative
evaluations, we demonstrate that 3DPR outperforms previous methods,
particularly in preserving identity and in capturing lighting effects such as
specularities, self-shadows, and subsurface scattering. Project Page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督模型需要大量标注数据，而SAM系列模型仍需人工提示。需要开发无需训练和人工干预的自动分割方法。

Method: 使用DINOv3密集特征和FAISS检索构建记忆库，通过掩码约束对应关系提取前景/背景点提示，自动指导SAM2进行分割。

Result: 在600张专家标注图像上测试，混合测试集mIoU达0.9863，优于FCN(0.8188)和检测器到框SAM基线(0.1839)。在真实场景下表现更佳。

Conclusion: 检索到提示的方法能够实现数据高效、鲁棒的舌象不规则边界分割，为TCM分析提供可靠工具。

Abstract: Accurate tongue segmentation is crucial for reliable TCM analysis. Supervised
models require large annotated datasets, while SAM-family models remain
prompt-driven. We present Memory-SAM, a training-free, human-prompt-free
pipeline that automatically generates effective prompts from a small memory of
prior cases via dense DINOv3 features and FAISS retrieval. Given a query image,
mask-constrained correspondences to the retrieved exemplar are distilled into
foreground/background point prompts that guide SAM2 without manual clicks or
model fine-tuning. We evaluate on 600 expert-annotated images (300 controlled,
300 in-the-wild). On the mixed test split, Memory-SAM achieves mIoU 0.9863,
surpassing FCN (0.8188) and a detector-to-box SAM baseline (0.1839). On
controlled data, ceiling effects above 0.98 make small differences less
meaningful given annotation variability, while our method shows clear gains
under real-world conditions. Results indicate that retrieval-to-prompt enables
data-efficient, robust segmentation of irregular boundaries in tongue imaging.

Motivation: 推动原生图像生成的前沿发展，探索统一文本到图像生成和图像编辑的单一架构，解决图像编辑这一挑战性任务。

Method: 采用自回归+扩散混合架构：自回归模型首先生成离散图像token，其隐藏状态作为扩散模型的调节信号来生成高保真图像，结合了自回归模型的推理能力和扩散模型的细节渲染能力。

Result: 在各种文本到图像和图像编辑基准测试中，BLIP3o-NEXT实现了优于现有模型的性能，达到了新的连贯性和真实感水平。

Conclusion: 架构选择可比较但需高效扩展和快速推理；强化学习能推动图像生成前沿；图像编辑仍具挑战但可通过后训练和数据引擎改进；数据质量和规模决定模型性能上限。

Abstract: We present BLIP3o-NEXT, a fully open-source foundation model in the BLIP3
series that advances the next frontier of native image generation. BLIP3o-NEXT
unifies text-to-image generation and image editing within a single
architecture, demonstrating strong image generation and image editing
capabilities. In developing the state-of-the-art native image generation model,
we identify four key insights: (1) Most architectural choices yield comparable
performance; an architecture can be deemed effective provided it scales
efficiently and supports fast inference; (2) The successful application of
reinforcement learning can further push the frontier of native image
generation; (3) Image editing still remains a challenging task, yet instruction
following and the consistency between generated and reference images can be
significantly enhanced through post-training and data engine; (4) Data quality
and scale continue to be decisive factors that determine the upper bound of
model performance. Building upon these insights, BLIP3o-NEXT leverages an
Autoregressive + Diffusion architecture in which an autoregressive model first
generates discrete image tokens conditioned on multimodal inputs, whose hidden
states are then used as conditioning signals for a diffusion model to generate
high-fidelity images. This architecture integrates the reasoning strength and
instruction following of autoregressive models with the fine-detail rendering
ability of diffusion models, achieving a new level of coherence and realism.
Extensive evaluations of various text-to-image and image-editing benchmarks
show that BLIP3o-NEXT achieves superior performance over existing models.

Motivation: 现有生物医学视觉语言模型的提示优化技术要么产生不可解释的潜在向量，要么生成单一文本提示，缺乏透明度且无法捕捉临床诊断的多面性，限制了在高风险医疗环境中的可信度。

Method: 提出BiomedXPro进化框架，利用大语言模型作为生物医学知识提取器和自适应优化器，自动生成多样化的可解释自然语言提示对集合。

Result: 在多个生物医学基准测试中，BiomedXPro持续优于最先进的提示调优方法，特别是在数据稀缺的少样本设置中表现突出。

Conclusion: BiomedXPro通过生成多样化的可解释提示集合，为模型预测提供了可验证的基础，是开发更可信和临床对齐AI系统的关键步骤。

Abstract: The clinical adoption of biomedical vision-language models is hindered by
prompt optimization techniques that produce either uninterpretable latent
vectors or single textual prompts. This lack of transparency and failure to
capture the multi-faceted nature of clinical diagnosis, which relies on
integrating diverse observations, limits their trustworthiness in high-stakes
settings. To address this, we introduce BiomedXPro, an evolutionary framework
that leverages a large language model as both a biomedical knowledge extractor
and an adaptive optimizer to automatically generate a diverse ensemble of
interpretable, natural-language prompt pairs for disease diagnosis. Experiments
on multiple biomedical benchmarks show that BiomedXPro consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art prompt-tuning methods, particularly in data-scarce few-shot
settings. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates a strong semantic alignment
between the discovered prompts and statistically significant clinical features,
grounding the model's performance in verifiable concepts. By producing a
diverse ensemble of interpretable prompts, BiomedXPro provides a verifiable
basis for model predictions, representing a critical step toward the
development of more trustworthy and clinically-aligned AI systems.

Abstract: Lens flare significantly degrades image quality, impacting critical computer
vision tasks like object detection and autonomous driving. Recent Single Image
Flare Removal (SIFR) methods perform poorly when off-frame light sources are
incomplete or absent. We propose LightsOut, a diffusion-based outpainting
framework tailored to enhance SIFR by reconstructing off-frame light sources.
Our method leverages a multitask regression module and LoRA fine-tuned

Abstract: Synthesizing large-scale, explorable, and geometrically accurate 3D urban
scenes is a challenging yet valuable task in providing immersive and embodied
applications. The challenges lie in the lack of large-scale and high-quality
real-world 3D scans for training generalizable generative models. In this
paper, we take an alternative route to create large-scale 3D scenes by
synergizing the readily available satellite imagery that supplies realistic
coarse geometry and the open-domain diffusion model for creating high-quality
close-up appearances. We propose \textbf{Skyfall-GS}, the first city-block
scale 3D scene creation framework without costly 3D annotations, also featuring
real-time, immersive 3D exploration. We tailor a curriculum-driven iterative
refinement strategy to progressively enhance geometric completeness and
photorealistic textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Skyfall-GS
provides improved cross-view consistent geometry and more realistic textures
compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Project page:

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 本文识别并解决了3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）中不透明物体重建时出现的虚假透明表面问题，提出了一种名为NGS的方法来鼓励表面高斯采用更高不透明度，并通过注入不透明噪声高斯来改善这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS重建的不透明物体经常表现出虚假透明表面，在交互式查看时导致背景和内部图案不一致。这个问题源于3DGS中缺乏对表面不透明度的显式约束，优化过程可能错误地为不透明区域分配透明度。

Method: 提出NGS策略，通过在训练期间向物体体积中注入不透明噪声高斯来鼓励表面高斯采用更高不透明度，仅需对现有泼溅过程进行最小修改。同时提出了基于透射率的度量指标来定量评估虚假透明度。

Result: 实验表明，NGS显著减少了虚假透明度，同时在标准渲染指标上保持竞争力，证明了其整体有效性。

Conclusion: 本文首次识别、表征并开发了解决3DGS中虚假透明伪影的方法，通过NGS策略有效改善了不透明物体重建的质量，并提出了相应的评估指标和数据集增强方法。

Abstract: Opaque objects reconstructed by 3DGS often exhibit a falsely transparent
surface, leading to inconsistent background and internal patterns under camera
motion in interactive viewing. This issue stems from the ill-posed optimization
in 3DGS. During training, background and foreground Gaussians are blended via
alpha-compositing and optimized solely against the input RGB images using a
photometric loss. As this process lacks an explicit constraint on surface
opacity, the optimization may incorrectly assign transparency to opaque
regions, resulting in view-inconsistent and falsely transparent. This issue is
difficult to detect in standard evaluation settings but becomes particularly
evident in object-centric reconstructions under interactive viewing. Although
other causes of view-inconsistency have been explored recently, false
transparency has not been explicitly identified. To the best of our knowledge,
we are the first to identify, characterize, and develop solutions for this
artifact, an underreported artifact in 3DGS. Our strategy, NGS, encourages
surface Gaussians to adopt higher opacity by injecting opaque noise Gaussians
in the object volume during training, requiring only minimal modifications to
the existing splatting process. To quantitatively evaluate false transparency
in static renderings, we propose a transmittance-based metric that measures the
severity of this artifact. In addition, we introduce a customized, high-quality
object-centric scan dataset exhibiting pronounced transparency issues, and we
augment popular existing datasets with complementary infill noise specifically
designed to assess the robustness of 3D reconstruction methods to false
transparency. Experiments across multiple datasets show that NGS substantially
reduces false transparency while maintaining competitive performance on
standard rendering metrics, demonstrating its overall effectiveness.

Abstract: This article presents a fully autonomous aerial masonry construction
framework using heterogeneous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), supported by
experimental validation. Two specialized UAVs were developed for the task: (i)
a brick-carrier UAV equipped with a ball-joint actuation mechanism for precise
brick manipulation, and (ii) an adhesion UAV integrating a servo-controlled
valve and extruder nozzle for accurate adhesion application. The proposed
framework employs a reactive mission planning unit that combines a dependency
graph of the construction layout with a conflict graph to manage simultaneous
task execution, while hierarchical state machines ensure robust operation and
safe transitions during task execution. Dynamic task allocation allows
real-time adaptation to environmental feedback, while minimum-jerk trajectory
generation ensures smooth and precise UAV motion during brick pickup and
placement. Additionally, the brick-carrier UAV employs an onboard vision system
that estimates brick poses in real time using ArUco markers and a least-squares
optimization filter, enabling accurate alignment during construction. To the
best of the authors' knowledge, this work represents the first experimental
demonstration of fully autonomous aerial masonry construction using
heterogeneous UAVs, where one UAV precisely places the bricks while another
autonomously applies adhesion material between them. The experimental results
supported by the video showcase the effectiveness of the proposed framework and
demonstrate its potential to serve as a foundation for future developments in
autonomous aerial robotic construction.

Conclusion: RM-RL框架有效解决了精密操作任务中人工演示依赖和数据效率问题，在真实世界操作中表现出色。

Abstract: Precise robot manipulation is critical for fine-grained applications such as
chemical and biological experiments, where even small errors (e.g., reagent
spillage) can invalidate an entire task. Existing approaches often rely on
pre-collected expert demonstrations and train policies via imitation learning
(IL) or offline reinforcement learning (RL). However, obtaining high-quality
demonstrations for precision tasks is difficult and time-consuming, while
offline RL commonly suffers from distribution shifts and low data efficiency.
We introduce a Role-Model Reinforcement Learning (RM-RL) framework that unifies
online and offline training in real-world environments. The key idea is a
role-model strategy that automatically generates labels for online training
data using approximately optimal actions, eliminating the need for human
demonstrations. RM-RL reformulates policy learning as supervised training,
reducing instability from distribution mismatch and improving efficiency. A
hybrid training scheme further leverages online role-model data for offline
reuse, enhancing data efficiency through repeated sampling. Extensive
experiments show that RM-RL converges faster and more stably than existing RL
methods, yielding significant gains in real-world manipulation: 53% improvement
in translation accuracy and 20% in rotation accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate
the successful execution of a challenging task, precisely placing a cell plate
onto a shelf, highlighting the framework's effectiveness where prior methods

Abstract: This article presents an extension of the Lagrange-Poincare Equations (LPE)
to model the dynamics of spacecraft-manipulator systems operating within a
non-inertial orbital reference frame. Building upon prior formulations of LPE
for vehicle-manipulator systems, the proposed framework, termed the
Lagrange-Poincare-Kepler Equations (LPKE), incorporates the coupling between
spacecraft attitude dynamics, orbital motion, and manipulator kinematics. The
formalism combines the Euler-Poincare equations for the base spacecraft,
Keplerian orbital dynamics for the reference frame, and reduced Euler-Lagrange
equations for the manipulator's shape space, using an exponential joint
parametrization. Leveraging the Lagrange-d'Alembert principle on principal
bundles, we derive novel closed-form structural matrices that explicitly
capture the effects of orbital disturbances and their dynamic coupling with the
manipulator system. The LPKE framework also systematically includes externally
applied, symmetry-breaking wrenches, allowing for immediate integration into
hardware-in-the-loop simulations and model-based control architectures for
autonomous robotic operations in the orbital environment. To illustrate the
effectiveness of the proposed model and its numerical superiority, we present a
simulation study analyzing orbital effects on a 7-degree-of-freedom manipulator
mounted on a spacecraft.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation for legged robots in complex and dynamic environments
relies on robust simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems to
accurately map surroundings and localize the robot, ensuring safe and efficient
operation. While prior sensor fusion-based SLAM approaches have integrated
various sensor modalities to improve their robustness, these algorithms are
still susceptible to estimation drift in challenging environments due to their
reliance on unsuitable fusion strategies. Therefore, we propose a robust
LiDAR-visual-inertial-kinematic odometry system that integrates information
from multiple sensors, such as a camera, LiDAR, inertial measurement unit
(IMU), and joint encoders, for visual and LiDAR-based odometry estimation. Our
system employs a fusion-based pose estimation approach that runs
optimization-based visual-inertial-kinematic odometry (VIKO) and filter-based
LiDAR-inertial-kinematic odometry (LIKO) based on measurement availability. In
VIKO, we utilize the footpreintegration technique and robust LiDAR-visual depth
consistency using superpixel clusters in a sliding window optimization. In
LIKO, we incorporate foot kinematics and employ a point-toplane residual in an
error-state iterative Kalman filter (ESIKF). Compared with other sensor
fusion-based SLAM algorithms, our approach shows robust performance across
public and longterm datasets.

TL;DR: PolyFly是一种用于空中运输机器人的最优全局规划器，通过将机器人组件和环境建模为独立多面体来消除保守的几何近似，从而生成更快的轨迹。

Motivation: 现有的空中运输机器人方法对车辆和障碍物进行几何保守近似，导致保守的机动和增加的飞行时间。需要消除这些限制以实现在受限环境中的激进飞行。

Method: 提出PolyFly方法，将机器人（四旋翼、电缆和负载）和环境的每个物理组件建模为独立多面体，并构建方向感知多面体以提高模型精度。通过对偶理论将多面体约束转换为平滑可微约束来高效求解最优控制问题。

Conclusion: PolyFly通过非保守的多面体建模显著提高了空中运输机器人的轨迹规划性能，在受限环境中实现了更快的飞行轨迹。

Abstract: Aerial transportation robots using suspended cables have emerged as versatile
platforms for disaster response and rescue operations. To maximize the
capabilities of these systems, robots need to aggressively fly through tightly
constrained environments, such as dense forests and structurally unsafe
buildings, while minimizing flight time and avoiding obstacles. Existing
methods geometrically over-approximate the vehicle and obstacles, leading to
conservative maneuvers and increased flight times. We eliminate these
restrictions by proposing PolyFly, an optimal global planner which considers a
non-conservative representation for aerial transportation by modeling each
physical component of the environment, and the robot (quadrotor, cable and
payload), as independent polytopes. We further increase the model accuracy by
incorporating the attitude of the physical components by constructing
orientation-aware polytopes. The resulting optimal control problem is
efficiently solved by converting the polytope constraints into smooth
differentiable constraints via duality theory. We compare our method against
the existing state-of-the-art approach in eight maze-like environments and show
that PolyFly produces faster trajectories in each scenario. We also
experimentally validate our proposed approach on a real quadrotor with a
suspended payload, demonstrating the practical reliability and accuracy of our
method.

Result: 实验结果显示该框架可减少高达84%的操作时间浪费，使灾后任务更加高效有效。

Conclusion: 所提出的SFT框架通过考虑现实世界因素如风力和无人机异质性，显著提升了无人机在灾难响应中的实用性。

Abstract: Natural and human-made disasters can cause severe devastation and claim
thousands of lives worldwide. Therefore, developing efficient methods for
disaster response and management is a critical task for relief teams. One of
the most essential components of effective response is the rapid collection of
information about affected areas, damages, and victims. More data translates
into better coordination, faster rescue operations, and ultimately, more lives
saved. However, in some disasters, such as earthquakes, the communication
infrastructure is often partially or completely destroyed, making it extremely
difficult for victims to send distress signals and for rescue teams to locate
and assist them in time. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as
valuable tools in such scenarios. In particular, a fleet of UAVs can be
dispatched from a mobile station to the affected area to facilitate data
collection and establish temporary communication networks. Nevertheless,
real-world deployment of UAVs faces several challenges, with adverse weather
conditions--especially wind--being among the most significant. To address this,
we develop a novel mathematical framework to determine the optimal location of
a mobile UAV station while explicitly accounting for the heterogeneity of the
UAVs and the effect of wind. In particular, we generalize the Sylvester problem
to introduce the Sylvester-Fermat-Torricelli (SFT) problem, which captures
complex factors such as wind influence, UAV heterogeneity, and back-and-forth
motion within a unified framework. The proposed framework enhances the
practicality of UAV-based disaster response planning by accounting for
real-world factors such as wind and UAV heterogeneity. Experimental results
demonstrate that it can reduce wasted operational time by up to 84%, making
post-disaster missions significantly more efficient and effective.

Abstract: Scene graphs enhance 3D mapping capabilities in robotics by understanding the
relationships between different spatial elements, such as rooms and objects.
Recent research extends scene graphs to hierarchical layers, adding and
leveraging constraints across these levels. This approach is tightly integrated
with pose-graph optimization, improving both localization and mapping accuracy
simultaneously. However, when segmenting spatial characteristics, consistently
recognizing rooms becomes challenging due to variations in viewpoints and
limited field of view (FOV) of sensors. For example, existing real-time
approaches often over-segment large rooms into smaller, non-functional spaces
that are not useful for localization and mapping due to the time-dependent
method. Conversely, their voxel-based room segmentation method often
under-segment in complex cases like not fully enclosed 3D space that are
non-traversable for ground robots or humans, leading to false constraints in
pose-graph optimization. We propose a traversability-aware room segmentation
method that considers the interaction between robots and surroundings, with
consistent feasibility of traversability information. This enhances both the
semantic coherence and computational efficiency of pose-graph optimization.
Improved performance is demonstrated through the re-detection frequency of the
same rooms in a dataset involving repeated traversals of the same space along
the same path, as well as the optimization time consumption.

Abstract: Black-box simulators are widely used in robotics, but optimizing their
parameters remains challenging due to inaccessible likelihoods.
Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) tackles this issue using simulation-driven
approaches, estimating the posterior from offline real observations and forward
simulations. However, in black-box scenarios, preparing observations that
contain sufficient information for parameter estimation is difficult due to the
unknown relationship between parameters and observations. In this work, we
present Active Simulation-Based Inference (ASBI), a parameter estimation
framework that uses robots to actively collect real-world online data to
achieve accurate black-box simulator tuning. Our framework optimizes robot
actions to collect informative observations by maximizing information gain,
which is defined as the expected reduction in Shannon entropy between the
posterior and the prior. While calculating information gain requires the
likelihood, which is inaccessible in black-box simulators, our method solves
this problem by leveraging Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE), which leverages a
neural network to learn the posterior estimator. Three simulation experiments
quantitatively verify that our method achieves accurate parameter estimation,
with posteriors sharply concentrated around the true parameters. Moreover, we
show a practical application using a real robot to estimate the simulation
parameters of cubic particles corresponding to two real objects, beads and
gravel, with a bucket pouring action.

Motivation: 在灾难响应等非结构化室内环境中，机器人不仅需要避开障碍物，还需要识别哪些障碍物可以被推开，以提高导航效率。

Method: 使用Movable Obstacles Layer标记LiDAR检测到的动态障碍物为可移动，并分配较低通行成本；通过Slow-Pose Progress Checker监控速度比，在机器人减速时调整成本权重，触发全局重新规划。

Conclusion: 该方法仅依赖平面扫描和CPU计算，适合资源受限的搜救机器人，表明交互感知成本地图是轻量级的ROS2原生扩展，可用于非结构化环境中的可移动障碍物导航。

Abstract: Reliable navigation in disaster-response and other unstructured indoor
settings requires robots not only to avoid obstacles but also to recognise when
those obstacles can be pushed aside. We present an adaptive, LiDAR and
odometry-based path-planning framework that embeds this capability into the
ROS2 Nav2 stack. A new Movable Obstacles Layer labels all LiDAR returns missing
from a prior static map as tentatively movable and assigns a reduced traversal
cost. A companion Slow-Pose Progress Checker monitors the ratio of commanded to
actual velocity; when the robot slows appreciably, the local cost is raised
from light to heavy, and on a stall to lethal, prompting the global planner to
back out and re-route. Gazebo evaluations on a Scout Mini, spanning isolated
objects and cluttered corridors, show higher goal-reach rates and fewer
deadlocks than a no-layer baseline, with traversal times broadly comparable.
Because the method relies only on planar scans and CPU-level computation, it
suits resource-constrained search and rescue robots and integrates into
heterogeneous platforms with minimal engineering. Overall, the results indicate
that interaction-aware cost maps are a lightweight, ROS2-native extension for
navigating among potentially movable obstacles in unstructured settings. The
full implementation will be released as open source

Abstract: Autonomous Underwater vehicles must operate in strong currents, limited
acoustic bandwidth, and persistent sensing requirements where conventional
swarm optimisation methods are unreliable. This paper presents NOAH, a novel
nature-inspired swarm optimisation algorithm that combines current-aware drift,
irreversible settlement in persistent sensing nodes, and colony-based
communication. Drawing inspiration from the behaviour of barnacle nauplii, NOAH
addresses the critical limitations of existing swarm algorithms by providing
hydrodynamic awareness, irreversible anchoring mechanisms, and colony-based
communication capabilities essential for underwater exploration missions. The
algorithm establishes a comprehensive foundation for scalable and
energy-efficient underwater swarm robotics with validated performance analysis.
Validation studies demonstrate an 86% success rate for permanent anchoring
scenarios, providing a unified formulation for hydrodynamic constraints and
irreversible settlement behaviours with an empirical study under flow.

Abstract: Automating chicken shoulder deboning requires precise 6-DoF cutting through a
partially occluded, deformable, multi-material joint, since contact with the
bones presents serious health and safety risks. Our work makes both
systems-level and algorithmic contributions to train and deploy a reactive
force-feedback cutting policy that dynamically adapts a nominal trajectory and
enables full 6-DoF knife control to traverse the narrow joint gap while
avoiding contact with the bones. First, we introduce an open-source
custom-built simulator for multi-material cutting that models coupling,
fracture, and cutting forces, and supports reinforcement learning, enabling
efficient training and rapid prototyping. Second, we design a reusable physical
testbed to emulate the chicken shoulder: two rigid "bone" spheres with
controllable pose embedded in a softer block, enabling rigorous and repeatable
evaluation while preserving essential multi-material characteristics of the
target problem. Third, we train and deploy a residual RL policy, with
discretized force observations and domain randomization, enabling robust
zero-shot sim-to-real transfer and the first demonstration of a learned policy
that debones a real chicken shoulder. Our experiments in our simulator, on our
physical testbed, and on real chicken shoulders show that our learned policy
reliably navigates the joint gap and reduces undesired bone/cartilage contact,
resulting in up to a 4x improvement over existing open-loop cutting baselines
in terms of success rate and bone avoidance. Our results also illustrate the
necessity of force feedback for safe and effective multi-material cutting. The

Abstract: In autonomous driving, dynamic environment and corner cases pose significant
challenges to the robustness of ego vehicle's state understanding and decision
making. We introduce VDRive, a novel pipeline for end-to-end autonomous driving
that explicitly models state-action mapping to address these challenges,
enabling interpretable and robust decision making. By leveraging the
advancement of the state understanding of the Vision Language Action Model
(VLA) with generative diffusion policy-based action head, our VDRive guides the
driving contextually and geometrically. Contextually, VLA predicts future
observations through token generation pre-training, where the observations are
represented as discrete codes by a Conditional Vector Quantized Variational
Autoencoder (CVQ-VAE). Geometrically, we perform reinforcement learning
fine-tuning of the VLA to predict future trajectories and actions based on
current driving conditions. VLA supplies the current state tokens and predicted
state tokens for the action policy head to generate hierarchical actions and
trajectories. During policy training, a learned critic evaluates the actions
generated by the policy and provides gradient-based feedback, forming an
actor-critic framework that enables a reinforcement-based policy learning
pipeline. Experiments show that our VDRive achieves state-of-the-art
performance in the Bench2Drive closed-loop benchmark and nuScenes open-loop
planning.

Motivation: 传统自动驾驶将预测和规划作为分离模块处理，近期转向更紧密的集成方法(IPP)。但尚不清楚这种集成是否真正改善了规划性能，需要研究预测在IPP中的作用。

Method: 基于PDM(简单车道跟随方法)构建增强的提案生成方法，重点生成多样化但现实且高质量的提案，将预测主要用于碰撞检查而非决策核心。

Result: 提案中心方法在高度交互和分布外场景中显著优于现有方法，建立了新的最先进结果。许多基于模仿学习的规划器在生成现实提案方面表现不佳，甚至不如简单车道跟随方法。

Conclusion: 当前IPP方法未能充分利用未来行为信息，规划性能的瓶颈在于提案生成质量而非预测准确性。提案中心方法通过强调高质量提案生成，在复杂场景中取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Traditionally, prediction and planning in autonomous driving (AD) have been
treated as separate, sequential modules. Recently, there has been a growing
shift towards tighter integration of these components, known as Integrated
Prediction and Planning (IPP), with the aim of enabling more informed and
adaptive decision-making. However, it remains unclear to what extent this
integration actually improves planning performance. In this work, we
investigate the role of prediction in IPP approaches, drawing on the widely
adopted Val14 benchmark, which encompasses more common driving scenarios with
relatively low interaction complexity, and the interPlan benchmark, which
includes highly interactive and out-of-distribution driving situations. Our
analysis reveals that even access to perfect future predictions does not lead
to better planning outcomes, indicating that current IPP methods often fail to
fully exploit future behavior information. Instead, we focus on high-quality
proposal generation, while using predictions primarily for collision checks. We
find that many imitation learning-based planners struggle to generate realistic
and plausible proposals, performing worse than PDM - a simple lane-following
approach. Motivated by this observation, we build on PDM with an enhanced
proposal generation method, shifting the emphasis towards producing diverse but
realistic and high-quality proposals. This proposal-centric approach
significantly outperforms existing methods, especially in out-of-distribution
and highly interactive settings, where it sets new state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: In the context of imitation learning, visuomotor-based diffusion policy
learning is one of the main directions in robotic manipulation. Most of these
approaches rely on point clouds as observation inputs and construct scene
representations through point clouds feature learning, which enables them to
achieve remarkable accuracy. However, the existing literature lacks an in-depth
exploration of vision-only solutions that have significant potential. In this
paper, we propose a Vision-Only and single-view Diffusion Policy learning
method (VO-DP) that leverages pretrained visual foundation models to achieve
effective fusion of semantic and geometric features. We utilize intermediate
features from VGGT incorporating semantic features from DINOv2 and geometric
features from Alternating Attention blocks. Features are fused via
cross-attention and spatially compressed with a CNN to form the input to the
policy head. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VO-DP not only outperforms
the vision-only baseline DP significantly but also exhibits distinct
performance trends against the point cloud-based method DP3: in simulation
tasks, VO-DP achieves an average success rate of 64.6% on par with DP3 64.0%
and far higher than DP 34.8%, while in real-world tasks, it reaches 87.9%,
outperforming both DP3 67.5% and DP 11.2% by a notable margin. Further
robustness evaluations confirm that VO-DP remains highly stable under varying
conditions including color, size, background, and lighting. Lastly, we
open-source a training library for robotic manipulation. Built on Accelerate,
this library supports multi-machine and multi-GPU parallel training, as well as
mixed precision training. It is compatible with visuomotor policies such as DP,
DP3 and VO-DP, and also supports the RoboTwin simulator.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在扰动估计方面具有优越性，能有效提升机械系统的跟踪精度。

Abstract: The nominal performance of mechanical systems is often degraded by unknown
disturbances. A two-degree-of-freedom control structure can decouple nominal
performance from disturbance rejection. However, perfect disturbance rejection
is unattainable when the disturbance dynamic is unknown. In this work, we
reveal an inherent trade-off in disturbance estimation subject to tracking
speed and tracking uncertainty. Then, we propose two novel methods to enhance
disturbance estimation: an interacting multiple model extended Kalman
filter-based disturbance observer and a multi-kernel correntropy extended
Kalman filter-based disturbance observer. Experiments on an exoskeleton verify
that the proposed two methods improve the tracking accuracy $36.3\%$ and
$16.2\%$ in hip joint error, and $46.3\%$ and $24.4\%$ in knee joint error,
respectively, compared to the extended Kalman filter-based disturbance
observer, in a time-varying interaction force scenario, demonstrating the
superiority of the proposed method.

Abstract: We provide an algorithm for adaptive legged locomotion via online learning
and model predictive control. The algorithm is composed of two interacting
modules: model predictive control (MPC) and online learning of residual
dynamics. The residual dynamics can represent modeling errors and external
disturbances. We are motivated by the future of autonomy where quadrupeds will
autonomously perform complex tasks despite real-world unknown uncertainty, such
as unknown payload and uneven terrains. The algorithm uses random Fourier
features to approximate the residual dynamics in reproducing kernel Hilbert
spaces. Then, it employs MPC based on the current learned model of the residual
dynamics. The model is updated online in a self-supervised manner using least
squares based on the data collected while controlling the quadruped. The
algorithm enjoys sublinear \textit{dynamic regret}, defined as the
suboptimality against an optimal clairvoyant controller that knows how the
residual dynamics. We validate our algorithm in Gazebo and MuJoCo simulations,
where the quadruped aims to track reference trajectories. The Gazebo
simulations include constant unknown external forces up to $12\boldsymbol{g}$,
where $\boldsymbol{g}$ is the gravity vector, in flat terrain, slope terrain
with $20\degree$ inclination, and rough terrain with $0.25m$ height variation.
The MuJoCo simulations include time-varying unknown disturbances with payload
up to $8~kg$ and time-varying ground friction coefficients in flat terrain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个仅使用标准乐高零件和家用设备的仿人机器人手，用于教育环境，向儿童展示现代机器人技术的前沿概念。

Method: 采用肌腱驱动设计，每个手指使用双电机驱动拮抗肌腱对，通过离合器齿轮的差动机制实现软协同运动。

Result: 设计出的机器人手能够自适应抓取各种物体，使用简单的驱动和控制机制实现精细控制。

Conclusion: 该乐高机器人手结合了先进的机器人手设计概念，具有教育和启发儿童学习现代机器人技术的潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces an anthropomorphic robot hand built entirely using LEGO
MINDSTORMS: the Educational SoftHand-A, a tendon-driven, highly-underactuated
robot hand based on the Pisa/IIT SoftHand and related hands. To be suitable for
an educational context, the design is constrained to use only standard LEGO
pieces with tests using common equipment available at home. The hand features
dual motors driving an agonist/antagonist opposing pair of tendons on each
finger, which are shown to result in reactive fine control. The finger motions
are synchonized through soft synergies, implemented with a differential
mechanism using clutch gears. Altogether, this design results in an
anthropomorphic hand that can adaptively grasp a broad range of objects using a
simple actuation and control mechanism. Since the hand can be constructed from
LEGO pieces and uses state-of-the-art design concepts for robotic hands, it has
the potential to educate and inspire children to learn about the frontiers of
modern robotics.

*Manuel J. Fernandez,Alejandro Suarez,Anibal Ollero,Matteo Fumagalli*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于长距离空中操作的变刚度连杆(VSL)，可在多旋翼平台和双臂机械手之间提供可调节的机械耦合，实现从柔性绳索到刚性杆的刚度切换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的长距离操作系统使用刚性或缆绳连接，限制了精度或将干扰传递给飞行器，需要一种能够根据任务需求调整刚度的机制。

Method: 在配备LiCAS双臂机械手的四旋翼上集成VSL系统，通过远程操作实验评估，包括外部干扰和包裹运输任务。

Result: 改变连杆刚度显著改变了无人机与负载之间的动态交互：柔性配置衰减外部冲击和空气动力扰动，刚性配置提高操作阶段的定位精度。

Conclusion: VSL增强了系统的多功能性和安全性，提供了可控的柔顺性与精度权衡。未来工作将专注于自主刚度调节、多绳配置和协作空中操作。

Abstract: This paper presents the integration of a Variable Stiffness Link (VSL) for
long-reach aerial manipulation, enabling adaptable mechanical coupling between
an aerial multirotor platform and a dual-arm manipulator. Conventional
long-reach manipulation systems rely on rigid or cable connections, which limit
precision or transmit disturbances to the aerial vehicle. The proposed VSL
introduces an adjustable stiffness mechanism that allows the link to behave
either as a flexible rope or as a rigid rod, depending on task requirements.
  The system is mounted on a quadrotor equipped with the LiCAS dual-arm
manipulator and evaluated through teleoperated experiments, involving external
disturbances and parcel transportation tasks. Results demonstrate that varying
the link stiffness significantly modifies the dynamic interaction between the
UAV and the payload. The flexible configuration attenuates external impacts and
aerodynamic perturbations, while the rigid configuration improves positional
accuracy during manipulation phases.
  These results confirm that VSL enhances versatility and safety, providing a
controllable trade-off between compliance and precision. Future work will focus
on autonomous stiffness regulation, multi-rope configurations, cooperative
aerial manipulation and user studies to further assess its impact on
teleoperated and semi-autonomous aerial tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D超声成像依赖昂贵的跟踪系统，而基于神经网络的方法受图像噪声和误差累积影响，需要一种成本效益高且精确的解决方案。

Method: 使用轻量级相机捕捉视觉反馈，引入图像恢复方法重建遮挡区域，开发仿真循环方法进行姿态估计，并采用视觉伺服控制器优化相机视图对齐。

Result: 在血管模型、圆锥模型和人体手臂上的验证显示，与参考重建的Hausdorff距离分别为0.359毫米、1.171毫米和0.858毫米。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了可靠的手持3D超声重建潜力，具有成本效益和精确性。

Abstract: Freehand 3D ultrasound (US) imaging using conventional 2D probes offers
flexibility and accessibility for diverse clinical applications but faces
challenges in accurate probe pose estimation. Traditional methods depend on
costly tracking systems, while neural network-based methods struggle with image
noise and error accumulation, compromising reconstruction precision. We propose
a cost-effective and versatile solution that leverages lightweight cameras and
visual servoing in simulated environments for precise 3D US imaging. These
cameras capture visual feedback from a textured planar workspace. To counter
occlusions and lighting issues, we introduce an image restoration method that
reconstructs occluded regions by matching surrounding texture patterns. For
pose estimation, we develop a simulation-in-the-loop approach, which replicates
the system setup in simulation and iteratively minimizes pose errors between
simulated and real-world observations. A visual servoing controller refines the
alignment of camera views, improving translational estimation by optimizing
image alignment. Validations on a soft vascular phantom, a 3D-printed conical
model, and a human arm demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of our approach,
with Hausdorff distances to the reference reconstructions of 0.359 mm, 1.171
mm, and 0.858 mm, respectively. These results confirm the method's potential
for reliable freehand 3D US reconstruction.

TL;DR: HEADER是一种基于注意力机制的强化学习方法，使用分层图结构进行大规模环境下的高效自主探索，在模拟和真实场景中相比现有方法提升了20%的探索效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推动基于学习的方法在自主机器人探索中的边界，特别是在环境规模和探索效率方面，解决现有方法在大规模环境中扩展性不足的问题。

Method: 提出HEADER方法：1）使用分层图结构表示机器人信念/地图；2）设计新颖的基于社区的算法构建和更新全局图，保持完全增量、形状自适应和线性复杂度；3）基于注意力网络的规划器在局部范围内精细推理附近信念，在全局尺度上粗略利用远处信息；4）引入无参数特权奖励避免手工奖励塑造带来的训练目标偏差。

Result: 在模拟的大规模探索场景中，HEADER比大多数现有学习和非学习方法具有更好的可扩展性，相比最先进的基线方法实现了高达20%的探索效率提升。在硬件部署中，在包括300m*230m校园环境的复杂真实场景中验证了有效性。

Conclusion: HEADER通过分层图表示、注意力机制规划器和无参数特权奖励，实现了在大规模环境中高效自主探索，显著提升了探索效率，并在真实场景中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: This work pushes the boundaries of learning-based methods in autonomous robot
exploration in terms of environmental scale and exploration efficiency. We
present HEADER, an attention-based reinforcement learning approach with
hierarchical graphs for efficient exploration in large-scale environments.
HEADER follows existing conventional methods to construct hierarchical
representations for the robot belief/map, but further designs a novel
community-based algorithm to construct and update a global graph, which remains
fully incremental, shape-adaptive, and operates with linear complexity.
Building upon attention-based networks, our planner finely reasons about the
nearby belief within the local range while coarsely leveraging distant
information at the global scale, enabling next-best-viewpoint decisions that
consider multi-scale spatial dependencies. Beyond novel map representation, we
introduce a parameter-free privileged reward that significantly improves model
performance and produces near-optimal exploration behaviors, by avoiding
training objective bias caused by handcrafted reward shaping. In simulated
challenging, large-scale exploration scenarios, HEADER demonstrates better
scalability than most existing learning and non-learning methods, while
achieving a significant improvement in exploration efficiency (up to 20%) over
state-of-the-art baselines. We also deploy HEADER on hardware and validate it
in complex, large-scale real-life scenarios, including a 300m*230m campus
environment.

Result: 实验表明DDACE在少样本条件下成功执行任务，并在动态多样化环境中有效泛化。

Conclusion: 模块化架构能够提升多机器人系统在实际应用中的实用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot learning framework for multi-robot
systems that integrate both spatial and temporal elements: Few-Shot
Demonstration-Driven Task Coordination and Trajectory Execution (DDACE). Our
approach leverages temporal graph networks for learning task-agnostic temporal
sequencing and Gaussian Processes for spatial trajectory modeling, ensuring
modularity and generalization across various tasks. By decoupling temporal and
spatial aspects, DDACE requires only a small number of demonstrations,
significantly reducing data requirements compared to traditional learning from
demonstration approaches. To validate our proposed framework, we conducted
extensive experiments in task environments designed to assess various aspects
of multi-robot coordination-such as multi-sequence execution, multi-action
dynamics, complex trajectory generation, and heterogeneous configurations. The
experimental results demonstrate that our approach successfully achieves task
execution under few-shot learning conditions and generalizes effectively across
dynamic and diverse settings. This work underscores the potential of modular
architectures in enhancing the practicality and scalability of multi-robot
systems in real-world applications. Additional materials are available at

Abstract: We present DexCanvas, a large-scale hybrid real-synthetic human manipulation
dataset containing 7,000 hours of dexterous hand-object interactions seeded
from 70 hours of real human demonstrations, organized across 21 fundamental

synchronized multi-view RGB-D, high-precision mocap with MANO hand parameters,
and per-frame contact points with physically consistent force profiles. Our
real-to-sim pipeline uses reinforcement learning to train policies that control
an actuated MANO hand in physics simulation, reproducing human demonstrations
while discovering the underlying contact forces that generate the observed
object motion. DexCanvas is the first manipulation dataset to combine
large-scale real demonstrations, systematic skill coverage based on established
taxonomies, and physics-validated contact annotations. The dataset can
facilitate research in robotic manipulation learning, contact-rich control, and
skill transfer across different hand morphologies.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OpenEstimate是一个用于评估语言模型在不确定性下进行数值估计任务的多领域基准测试，发现前沿语言模型的概率先验通常不准确且过于自信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中语言模型需要处理不完整信息并在不确定性下进行推理，但现有评估主要关注有明确答案的问题，缺乏对不确定性推理能力的系统评估。

Method: 构建OpenEstimate基准测试，评估语言模型在需要综合大量背景信息的数值估计任务中的表现，要求模型以概率先验形式表达预测，并评估其准确性和校准度。

Result: 在六个前沿语言模型上的测试显示，模型生成的先验通常不准确且过于自信，性能受不确定性引发方式影响有限，采样策略、推理努力或提示设计的改变对结果影响不大。

Conclusion: OpenEstimate为前沿语言模型提供了一个具有挑战性的评估平台，有助于开发在概率估计和不确定性推理方面表现更好的模型。

Abstract: Real-world settings where language models (LMs) are deployed -- in domains
spanning healthcare, finance, and other forms of knowledge work -- require
models to grapple with incomplete information and reason under uncertainty. Yet
most LM evaluations focus on problems with well-defined answers and success
criteria. This gap exists in part because natural problems involving
uncertainty are difficult to construct: given that LMs have access to most of
the same knowledge as humans, it is non-trivial to design questions for which
LMs will struggle to produce correct answers, but which humans can answer
reliably. As a result, LM performance on reasoning under uncertainty remains
poorly characterized. To address this gap, we introduce OpenEstimate, an
extensible, multi-domain benchmark for evaluating LMs on numerical estimation
tasks that require models to synthesize significant amounts of background
information and express predictions as probabilistic priors. We assess these
priors for accuracy and calibration, quantifying their usefulness relative to
samples from the true distribution of interest. Across six frontier LMs, we
find that LM-elicited priors are often inaccurate and overconfident.
Performance improves modestly depending on how uncertainty is elicited from the
model, but is largely unaffected by changes in sampling strategy, reasoning
effort, or prompt design. The OpenEstimate benchmark thus offers a challenging
evaluation for frontier LMs and a platform for developing models that are
better at probabilistic estimation and reasoning under uncertainty.

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了深度强化学习在虚拟环境中让智能体既能生成又能解决内容的潜力，为AI在创意游戏开发过程中的贡献开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Procedural content generation (PCG) has become an increasingly popular
technique in game development, allowing developers to generate dynamic,
replayable, and scalable environments with reduced manual effort. In this
study, a novel method for procedural level design using Deep Reinforcement
Learning (DRL) within a Unity-based 3D environment is proposed. The system
comprises two agents: a hummingbird agent, acting as a solver, and a floating
island agent, responsible for generating and placing collectible objects
(flowers) on the terrain in a realistic and context-aware manner. The
hummingbird is trained using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm
from the Unity ML-Agents toolkit. It learns to navigate through the terrain
efficiently, locate flowers, and collect them while adapting to the
ever-changing procedural layout of the island. The island agent is also trained
using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. It learns to generate
flower layouts based on observed obstacle positions, the hummingbird's initial
state, and performance feedback from previous episodes. The interaction between
these agents leads to emergent behavior and robust generalization across
various environmental configurations. The results demonstrate that the approach
not only produces effective and efficient agent behavior but also opens up new
opportunities for autonomous game level design driven by machine learning. This
work highlights the potential of DRL in enabling intelligent agents to both
generate and solve content in virtual environments, pushing the boundaries of
what AI can contribute to creative game development processes.

<details>

Motivation: 挑战柏拉图表示假说，指出仅凭观测充分性无法保证干预能力，因为观测等价的世界在干预下可能产生分歧，需要从观测学习转向错误中心的范式。

Method: 提出因果力学方法，将假设空间变化作为首要操作，建立结构原则包括局部性和自主性原则、独立因果机制和组合自主性原则，用于模块化干预和错误发现。

Result: 建立了使错误发现和修正可行的结构原则框架，提供了将不可达错误转化为可达错误并修正的可行路径。

Conclusion: AGI发展需要理论突破，因果力学通过错误中心和假设空间扩展的方法为构建具有干预和反事实能力的智能系统提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We argue that progress toward AGI is theory limited rather than data or scale
limited. Building on the critical rationalism of Popper and Deutsch, we
challenge the Platonic Representation Hypothesis. Observationally equivalent
worlds can diverge under interventions, so observational adequacy alone cannot
guarantee interventional competence. We begin by laying foundations,
definitions of knowledge, learning, intelligence, counterfactual competence and
AGI, and then analyze the limits of observational learning that motivate an
error centric shift. We recast the problem as three questions about how
explicit and implicit errors evolve under an agent's actions, which errors are
unreachable within a fixed hypothesis space, and how conjecture and criticism
expand that space. From these questions we propose Causal Mechanics, a
mechanisms first program in which hypothesis space change is a first class
operation and probabilistic structure is used when useful rather than presumed.
We advance structural principles that make error discovery and correction
tractable, including a differential Locality and Autonomy Principle for modular
interventions, a gauge invariant form of Independent Causal Mechanisms for
separability, and the Compositional Autonomy Principle for analogy
preservation, together with actionable diagnostics. The aim is a scaffold for
systems that can convert unreachable errors into reachable ones and correct
them.

Abstract: Simulating human reasoning in open-ended tasks has been a long-standing
aspiration in AI and cognitive science. While large language models now
approximate human responses at scale, they remain tuned to population-level
consensus, often erasing the individuality of reasoning styles and belief
trajectories. To advance the vision of more human-like reasoning in machines,
we introduce HugAgent (Human-Grounded Agent Benchmark), a benchmark for
average-to-individual reasoning adaptation. The task is to predict how a
specific person would reason and update their beliefs in novel scenarios, given
partial evidence of their past views. HugAgent adopts a dual-track design: a
synthetic track for scale and systematic stress tests, and a human track for
ecologically valid, "out-loud" reasoning data. This design enables scalable,
reproducible evaluation of intra-agent fidelity: whether models can capture not
just what people believe, but how their reasoning evolves. Experiments with
state-of-the-art LLMs reveal persistent adaptation gaps, positioning HugAgent
as the first extensible benchmark for aligning machine reasoning with the
individuality of human thought. Our benchmark and chatbot are open-sourced as

Abstract: Automated emotion recognition in real-world workplace settings remains a
challenging problem in affective computing due to the scarcity of large-scale,
longitudinal datasets collected in naturalistic environments. We present a
novel dataset comprising 733,651 facial expression records from 38 employees
collected over 30.5 months (November 2021 to May 2024) in an authentic office
environment. Each record contains seven emotion probabilities (neutral, happy,
sad, surprised, fear, disgusted, angry) derived from deep learning-based facial
expression recognition, along with comprehensive metadata including job roles,
employment outcomes, and personality traits. The dataset uniquely spans the
COVID-19 pandemic period, capturing emotional responses to major societal
events including the Shanghai lockdown and policy changes. We provide 32
extended emotional metrics computed using established affective science
methods, including valence, arousal, volatility, predictability, inertia, and
emotional contagion strength. Technical validation demonstrates high data
quality through successful replication of known psychological patterns (weekend
effect: +192% valence improvement, p < 0.001; diurnal rhythm validated) and
perfect predictive validity for employee turnover (AUC=1.0). Baseline
experiments using Random Forest and LSTM models achieve 91.2% accuracy for
emotion classification and R2 = 0.84 for valence prediction. This is the
largest and longest longitudinal workplace emotion dataset publicly available,
enabling research in emotion recognition, affective dynamics modeling,

*Brett Reynolds*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出AGI评估应该采用非对称权重和持续性测试，而非传统的对称权重和快照测试，以更好地衡量通用智能的稳定性和持久性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AGI评估存在两个问题：对称权重假设所有领域同等重要，而人类智能研究表明并非如此；快照测试无法区分持久能力和脆弱表现。作者认为通用智能应该被理解为一种稳态属性集群。

Method: 提出两种扩展方法：基于因果中心性的权重评分（导入CHC衍生权重），以及集群稳定性指数系列（评估配置持久性、持久学习和错误纠正）。

Result: 这些扩展方法保持了多领域广度，同时减少了脆弱性和博弈行为，提供了可测试的预测和黑盒协议。

Conclusion: AGI评估应该考虑领域权重和持续性，以更好地衡量真正的通用智能，而不仅仅是快照表现。

Abstract: Contemporary AGI evaluations report multidomain capability profiles, yet they
typically assign symmetric weights and rely on snapshot scores. This creates
two problems: (i) equal weighting treats all domains as equally important when
human intelligence research suggests otherwise, and (ii) snapshot testing can't
distinguish durable capabilities from brittle performances that collapse under
delay or stress. I argue that general intelligence -- in humans and potentially
in machines -- is better understood as a homeostatic property cluster: a set of
abilities plus the mechanisms that keep those abilities co-present under
perturbation. On this view, AGI evaluation should weight domains by their
causal centrality (their contribution to cluster stability) and require
evidence of persistence across sessions. I propose two battery-compatible
extensions: a centrality-prior score that imports CHC-derived weights with
transparent sensitivity analysis, and a Cluster Stability Index family that
separates profile persistence, durable learning, and error correction. These
additions preserve multidomain breadth while reducing brittleness and gaming. I
close with testable predictions and black-box protocols labs can adopt without

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LLM代理与知识图谱交互的多维数据分析方法，构建动态协作分析生态系统，用于产品生态系统分析和关系挖掘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大数据时代，从海量异构复杂关联的多维数据中提取深度洞察面临挑战。LLM存在幻觉问题且难以实时更新，知识图谱静态特性限制了动态交互和分析能力。

Method: 利用LLM代理从非结构化数据自动提取产品数据，实时构建和可视化知识图谱，通过交互平台支持用户对图节点进行深度探索分析。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在产品生态系统分析、关系挖掘和用户驱动探索分析方面具有显著优势。

Conclusion: 为多维数据分析提供了新思路和工具，构建了动态协作的分析生态系统。

Abstract: In the current era of big data, extracting deep insights from massive,
heterogeneous, and complexly associated multi-dimensional data has become a
significant challenge. Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in natural
language understanding and generation, but still suffer from "hallucination"
issues when processing structured knowledge and are difficult to update in
real-time. Although Knowledge Graphs (KGs) can explicitly store structured
knowledge, their static nature limits dynamic interaction and analytical
capabilities. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional data analysis
method based on the interactions between LLM agents and KGs, constructing a
dynamic, collaborative analytical ecosystem. This method utilizes LLM agents to
automatically extract product data from unstructured data, constructs and
visualizes the KG in real-time, and supports users in deep exploration and
analysis of graph nodes through an interactive platform. Experimental results
show that this method has significant advantages in product ecosystem analysis,
relationship mining, and user-driven exploratory analysis, providing new ideas
and tools for multi-dimensional data analysis.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KG-Agent是一个经验驱动的学习框架，通过将像素级GUI交互构建成状态-动作知识图谱来解决API缺失环境下LLM智能体的效率瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有软件大多缺乏可访问的API，智能体只能通过像素级GUI操作，导致决策短视、依赖试错，阻碍技能获取和长期规划。

Method: 构建持久的状态-动作知识图谱(SA-KG)，将功能相似但视觉不同的GUI状态连接起来；设计基于图拓扑的混合内在奖励机制，结合状态价值奖励和新颖性奖励。

Result: 在Civilization V和Slay the Spire两个复杂GUI决策环境中，相比最先进方法显著提升了探索效率和策略深度。

Conclusion: KG-Agent通过知识图谱结构化解耦战略规划与探索发现，有效解决了API缺失环境下智能体的长期规划问题。

Abstract: Most existing software lacks accessible Application Programming Interfaces
(APIs), requiring agents to operate solely through pixel-based Graphical User
Interfaces (GUIs). In this API-free setting, large language model (LLM)-based
agents face severe efficiency bottlenecks: limited to local visual experiences,
they make myopic decisions and rely on inefficient trial-and-error, hindering
both skill acquisition and long-term planning. To address these challenges, we
propose KG-Agent, an experience-driven learning framework that structures an
agent's raw pixel-level interactions into a persistent State-Action Knowledge
Graph (SA-KG). KG-Agent overcomes inefficient exploration by linking
functionally similar but visually distinct GUI states, forming a rich
neighborhood of experience that enables the agent to generalize from a diverse
set of historical strategies. To support long-horizon reasoning, we design a
hybrid intrinsic reward mechanism based on the graph topology, combining a
state value reward for exploiting known high-value pathways with a novelty
reward that encourages targeted exploration. This approach decouples strategic
planning from pure discovery, allowing the agent to effectively value setup
actions with delayed gratification. We evaluate KG-Agent in two complex,
open-ended GUI-based decision-making environments (Civilization V and Slay the
Spire), demonstrating significant improvements in exploration efficiency and
strategic depth over the state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: AUGUSTUS是一个多模态智能体系统，采用图结构多模态上下文记忆，通过语义标签和上下文关联实现概念驱动的信息检索，在ImageNet分类任务中比传统多模态RAG快3.5倍，并在MSC基准测试中优于MemGPT。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有智能体系统主要存储文本信息，忽略了多模态信号的重要性。受人类记忆多模态性质的启发，提出与认知科学中人类记忆理念对齐的多模态智能体系统。

Method: 系统包含4个循环阶段：编码（理解输入）、存储到记忆（保存重要信息）、检索（从记忆中搜索相关上下文）、行动（执行任务）。使用图结构多模态上下文记忆，将信息概念化为语义标签并与上下文关联，实现概念驱动的检索。

Result: 在ImageNet分类任务中比传统多模态RAG方法快3.5倍，在MSC基准测试中优于MemGPT。

Conclusion: AUGUSTUS系统通过图结构多模态上下文记忆和概念驱动的检索方法，在多模态智能体任务中表现出色，验证了多模态记忆系统的重要性。

Abstract: Riding on the success of LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
there has been a growing interest in augmenting agent systems with external
memory databases. However, the existing systems focus on storing text
information in their memory, ignoring the importance of multimodal signals.
Motivated by the multimodal nature of human memory, we present AUGUSTUS, a
multimodal agent system aligned with the ideas of human memory in cognitive
science. Technically, our system consists of 4 stages connected in a loop: (i)
encode: understanding the inputs; (ii) store in memory: saving important
information; (iii) retrieve: searching for relevant context from memory; and
(iv) act: perform the task. Unlike existing systems that use vector databases,
we propose conceptualizing information into semantic tags and associating the
tags with their context to store them in a graph-structured multimodal
contextual memory for efficient concept-driven retrieval. Our system
outperforms the traditional multimodal RAG approach while being 3.5 times
faster for ImageNet classification and outperforming MemGPT on the MSC
benchmark.

Motivation: 随着LLM在编码和多模态理解方面的进步，需要更好的基准来评估指令到HTML生成任务，现有方法在数据质量和评估粒度方面存在不足。

Method: 提出三个关键创新：1) 无界可扩展的代理爬取框架持续收集真实网页；2) 结构化分节数据表示整合元数据、局部UI截图和JSON格式资源；3) 分节级多模态评估协议对齐文本、布局和视觉组件。

Abstract: Witnessed by the recent advancements on leveraging LLM for coding and
multimodal understanding, we present WebGen-V, a new benchmark and framework
for instruction-to-HTML generation that enhances both data quality and
evaluation granularity. WebGen-V contributes three key innovations: (1) an
unbounded and extensible agentic crawling framework that continuously collects
real-world webpages and can leveraged to augment existing benchmarks; (2) a
structured, section-wise data representation that integrates metadata,
localized UI screenshots, and JSON-formatted text and image assets, explicit
alignment between content, layout, and visual components for detailed
multimodal supervision; and (3) a section-level multimodal evaluation protocol
aligning text, layout, and visuals for high-granularity assessment. Experiments
with state-of-the-art LLMs and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of
our structured data and section-wise evaluation, as well as the contribution of
each component. To the best of our knowledge, WebGen-V is the first work to
enable high-granularity agentic crawling and evaluation for instruction-to-HTML
generation, providing a unified pipeline from real-world data acquisition and
webpage generation to structured multimodal assessment.

TL;DR: VERITAS是一个通过整合视觉先验和多模态大模型来提升监督微调数据质量的管道，能有效减少事实错误和幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大模型的数据增强方法因视觉感知不足而存在事实错误和幻觉问题，需要更可靠的数据质量提升方案。

Method: 利用视觉识别模型和OCR提取视觉先验，结合三个LMM评估原始答案，通过统计融合获得共识分数作为真实标签，训练轻量级批评模型，最后生成精炼答案。

Result: 在六个多模态基准测试中，使用VERITAS处理数据微调的模型表现优于使用原始数据的模型，尤其在文本丰富和细粒度推理任务中。

Conclusion: VERITAS能有效提升多模态数据质量，其批评模型在保持高效的同时展现出与先进LMM相当的能力。

Abstract: The quality of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data is crucial for the
performance of large multimodal models (LMMs), yet current data enhancement
methods often suffer from factual errors and hallucinations due to inadequate
visual perception. To address this challenge, we propose VERITAS, a pipeline
that systematically integrates vision priors and multiple state-of-the-art LMMs
with statistical methods to enhance SFT data quality. VERITAS leverages visual
recognition models (RAM++) and OCR systems (PP-OCRv4) to extract structured
vision priors, which are combined with images, questions, and answers. Three
LMMs (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Doubao-1.5-pro) evaluate the original answers,
providing critique rationales and scores that are statistically fused into a
high-confidence consensus score serving as ground truth. Using this consensus,
we train a lightweight critic model via Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), enhancing reasoning capabilities efficiently. Each LMM then refines the
original answers based on the critiques, generating new candidate answers; we
select the highest-scoring one as the final refined answer. Experiments across
six multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that models fine-tuned with data
processed by VERITAS consistently outperform those using raw data, particularly
in text-rich and fine-grained reasoning tasks. Our critic model exhibits
enhanced capability comparable to state-of-the-art LMMs while being
significantly more efficient. We release our pipeline, datasets, and model
checkpoints to advance research in multimodal data optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习算法虽然提高了模型准确性，但会导致响应过长和过度推理问题，增加了推理延迟和计算消耗，特别是对于简单任务。

Method: DEPO框架包含三个核心组件：创新的优势解耦算法、难度感知长度惩罚和优势裁剪方法，用于指导模型减少低效token并优化策略。

Result: 在DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-7B和1.5B模型上的实验表明，DEPO实现了序列长度减少39%，减少了低效token中的过度推理路径，同时在整体准确率上优于基础模型。

Conclusion: DEPO有效解决了大型推理模型中过度推理和响应过长的问题，在保持准确性的同时显著降低了计算消耗和推理延迟。

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable performance in
solving complex problems via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement
learning (RL). Although existing RL algorithms significantly enhance model
accuracy, they still suffer from excessively lengthy responses and overthinking
issues, resulting in increased inference latency and computational consumption,
especially for simple tasks that require minimal reasoning. To address this, we
propose a novel RL framework, DEPO, to reduce inefficient reasoning for models.
Our method mainly consists of three core components: (1) an innovative
advantage decoupled algorithm to guide model reduction of inefficient tokens;
(2) a difficulty-aware length penalty to lower the overall length of model
responses; (3) an advantage clipping method to prevent bias in policy
optimization. In our experiments, applied to DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-7B and
DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B as base models, DEPO achieves a significant
reduction in sequence length by 39% and reduces excessive reasoning paths in
inefficient tokens, while outperforming the base model in overall accuracy.

Motivation: 模拟集成电路布局中机器学习技术应用受限，主要由于电气约束、特定问题要求以及布局规划与布线步骤的相互依赖关系。布局工程师需要现成的布线感知布局规划解决方案。

Method: 使用强化学习和关系图卷积神经网络开发自动布局引擎，结合增加的网格分辨率和精确引脚信息集成，以及动态布线资源估计技术来平衡布线效率和面积效率。

Result: 在模拟环境中，与过去基于学习的最先进技术相比，该方法实现了死区面积减少13.8%、线长减少40.6%、布线成功率提高73.4%。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够满足工业标准，在布线感知布局规划方面表现出色，显著提升了模拟集成电路布局的效率和成功率。

Abstract: The adoption of machine learning-based techniques for analog integrated
circuit layout, unlike its digital counterpart, has been limited by the
stringent requirements imposed by electric and problem-specific constraints,
along with the interdependence of floorplanning and routing steps. In this
work, we address a prevalent concern among layout engineers regarding the need
for readily available routing-aware floorplanning solutions. To this extent, we
develop an automatic floorplanning engine based on reinforcement learning and
relational graph convolutional neural network specifically tailored to
condition the floorplan generation towards more routable outcomes. A
combination of increased grid resolution and precise pin information
integration, along with a dynamic routing resource estimation technique, allows
balancing routing and area efficiency, eventually meeting industrial standards.
When analyzing the place and route effectiveness in a simulated environment,
the proposed approach achieves a 13.8% reduction in dead space, a 40.6%
reduction in wirelength and a 73.4% increase in routing success when compared
to past learning-based state-of-the-art techniques.

*Rubi Hudson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了可修正性目标的概念，通过转换方法使任何目标都能在不牺牲性能的情况下变得可修正，从而避免AI抵制训练更新或关闭。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI在部分学习目标后往往会抵制进一步的目标更新，因为继续追求现有目标通常更有利。这种抵制行为会阻碍训练收敛、错误修正和偏好变化，因此需要确保目标具有可修正性。

Method: 引入形式化定义，提出一种转换方法，通过近视地获取在无成本阻止更新条件下的奖励预测，构建任何目标的可修正版本。该方法还可递归扩展到新创建的代理，并防止代理故意修改目标。

Result: 两个网格世界实验表明，这些可修正目标能够有效学习，并产生期望的行为。

Conclusion: 可修正性是关键的安全属性，提出的转换方法能够在不损失性能的情况下实现可修正性，为AI安全提供了重要保障。

Abstract: For an AI's training process to successfully impart a desired goal, it is
important that the AI does not attempt to resist the training. However,
partially learned goals will often incentivize an AI to avoid further goal
updates, as most goals are better achieved by an AI continuing to pursue them.
We say that a goal is corrigible if it does not incentivize taking actions that
avoid proper goal updates or shutdown. In addition to convergence in training,
corrigibility also allows for correcting mistakes and changes in human
preferences, which makes it a crucial safety property. Despite this, the
existing literature does not include specifications for goals that are both
corrigible and competitive with non-corrigible alternatives. We provide a
formal definition for corrigibility, then introduce a transformation that
constructs a corrigible version of any goal that can be made corrigible,
without sacrificing performance. This is done by myopically eliciting
predictions of reward conditional on costlessly preventing updates, which then
also determine the reward when updates are accepted. The transformation can be
modified to recursively extend corrigibility to any new agents created by
corrigible agents, and to prevent agents from deliberately modifying their
goals. Two gridworld experiments demonstrate that these corrigible goals can be
learned effectively, and that they lead to the desired behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将强化学习从单智能体任务扩展到多轮次、多智能体场景面临长期信用分配和智能体特定优势估计的挑战，需要开发新的训练框架来提升LLM在多智能体系统中的协作和竞争能力。

Method: MARS框架包含轮次级优势估计器来对齐学习信号进行信用分配，以及智能体特定优势归一化来稳定多智能体训练。通过自博弈在合作和竞争游戏中训练Qwen3-4B模型。

Conclusion: 在战略游戏中使用自博弈进行端到端RL训练是开发LLM可泛化多智能体推理能力的有效方法，证明了该方法的强大潜力。

Abstract: Developing Large Language Models (LLMs) to cooperate and compete effectively
within multi-agent systems is a critical step towards more advanced
intelligence. While reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective for
enhancing reasoning in single-agent tasks, its extension to multi-turn,
multi-agent scenarios remains underexplored due to the challenges of
long-horizon credit assignment and agent-specific advantage estimation. To
address these challenges, we introduce MARS, an end-to-end RL framework that
incentivizes Multi-Agent Reasoning of LLMs through Self-play in both
cooperative and competitive games. MARS features a turn-level advantage
estimator that aligns learning signals with each interaction for credit
assignment, and an agent-specific advantage normalization to stabilize
multi-agent training. By learning with self-play across cooperative and
competitive games, the MARS agent trained from Qwen3-4B develops strong
strategic abilities that generalize to held-out games with up to 28.7%
performance improvements. More importantly, the capability acquired through
self-play generalizes beyond games, yielding consistent performance gains of
multi-agent systems in reasoning benchmarks. When integrated into leading
multi-agent systems, our MARS agent achieves significant performance gains of
10.0% on AIME and 12.5% on GPQA-Diamond. These results establish end-to-end RL
training with self-play in strategic games as a powerful approach for
developing generalizable multi-agent reasoning capabilities in LLMs. Our code

Result: 系统能够准确提供专业化响应，同时保持对话能力，支持API和Web接口，完全开源，为领域自适应AI助手提供可扩展基础。

Conclusion: Adaptive Minds通过将LoRA适配器作为工具的动态选择机制，成功实现了在保持基础模型灵活性的同时提供领域专业化能力，为构建可扩展的领域自适应AI系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present Adaptive Minds, an agentic system that treats LoRA adapters as
domain-specific tools. Instead of relying on a single fine-tuned model or rigid
rule-based routing, our approach empowers the base LLM itself to act as a
semantic router analyzing each query and dynamically selecting the most
relevant LoRA tool. This enables the agent to seamlessly switch between
different domain experts on demand. By combining the flexibility of multi-agent
orchestration with the efficiency of parameter-efficient fine-tuning, Adaptive
Minds delivers accurate, specialized responses while preserving conversational
ability. The system is built with LangGraph for workflow management, supports
both API and web interfaces, and is fully open source, providing a scalable and
extensible foundation for domain-adaptive AI assistance.

Motivation: 现有方法存在判断不一致性问题，特别是偏好循环等逻辑一致性问题尚未得到充分解决，这会破坏强化学习的稳定性。

Method: 开发了CDR指标量化判断冲突，并提出DGR框架：构建偏好图、转换为无冲突有向无环图、生成逻辑一致的奖励信号，兼容任何策略优化器。

Result: 实验结果表明该框架相比强基线显著提高了训练稳定性和模型性能。

Conclusion: 逻辑一致性是AI反馈的关键维度，现在可以通过该框架进行有效管理。

Abstract: However, this method often faces judgment inconsistencies that can
destabilize reinforcement learning. While prior research has focused on the
accuracy of judgments, the critical issue of logical coherence especially
issues such as preference cycles hasn't been fully addressed. To fill this gap,
we introduce a comprehensive framework designed to systematically detect and
resolve these inconsistencies during the reinforcement learning training
process. Our framework includes two main contributions: first, the Conflict
Detection Rate (CDR), a new metric that quantifies judgment conflicts, and
second, Deconflicted Graph Rewards (DGR), a framework that purifies signals by
removing cycles before policy optimization. DGR constructs preference graphs
from the initial judgments, transforms them into conflict-free Directed Acyclic
Graphs (DAGs), and generates a logically coherent reward signal that is
compatible with any policy optimizer. Experimental results show that our
framework significantly enhances training stability and model performance
compared to strong baselines, establishing logical consistency as a crucial and
now manageable dimension of AI feedback.

Conclusion: MM-HCAN为全面多故障诊断提供了可扩展且鲁棒的解决方案，支持工业环境中的预测性维护和延长资产寿命。

Abstract: Reliable induction motor (IM) fault diagnosis is vital for industrial safety
and operational continuity, mitigating costly unplanned downtime. Conventional
approaches often struggle to capture complex multimodal signal relationships,
are constrained to unimodal data or single fault types, and exhibit performance
degradation under noisy or cross-domain conditions. This paper proposes the
Multimodal Hypergraph Contrastive Attention Network (MM-HCAN), a unified
framework for robust fault diagnosis. To the best of our knowledge, MM-HCAN is
the first to integrate contrastive learning within a hypergraph topology
specifically designed for multimodal sensor fusion, enabling the joint
modelling of intra- and inter-modal dependencies and enhancing generalisation
beyond Euclidean embedding spaces. The model facilitates simultaneous diagnosis
of bearing, stator, and rotor faults, addressing the engineering need for
consolidated di- agnostic capabilities. Evaluated on three real-world
benchmarks, MM-HCAN achieves up to 99.82% accuracy with strong cross-domain
generalisation and resilience to noise, demonstrating its suitability for
real-world deployment. An ablation study validates the contribution of each
component. MM-HCAN provides a scalable and robust solution for comprehensive
multi-fault diagnosis, supporting predictive maintenance and extended asset
longevity in industrial environments.

TL;DR: JudgeSQL是一个解决Text-to-SQL任务中查询候选选择问题的框架，通过结构化推理和加权共识锦标赛机制，提升SQL查询选择的准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Text-to-SQL方法在测试时扩展时面临选择正确查询的瓶颈，传统方法如自一致性或最佳N解码只能提供浅层信号，容易产生不一致评分、脆弱推理链，无法捕捉细粒度语义差异。

Method: 开发基于推理的SQL判断模型，通过强化学习在可验证奖励指导下提炼推理轨迹；构建加权共识锦标赛机制，整合显式推理偏好和隐式生成器置信度。

Result: 在BIRD基准测试上的广泛实验表明，JudgeSQL展现出优越的SQL判断能力、良好的跨尺度泛化能力以及对生成器容量的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: JudgeSQL通过结构化推理和加权共识机制，为Text-to-SQL任务中的查询选择问题提供了更可靠和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL is a pivotal task that bridges natural language understanding and
structured data access, yet it remains fundamentally challenging due to
semantic ambiguity and complex compositional reasoning. While large language
models (LLMs) have greatly advanced SQL generation though prompting, supervised
finetuning and reinforced tuning, the shift toward test-time scaling exposes a
new bottleneck: selecting the correct query from a diverse candidate pool.
Existing selection approaches, such as self-consistency or best-of-$N$
decoding, provide only shallow signals, making them prone to inconsistent
scoring, fragile reasoning chains, and a failure to capture fine-grained
semantic distinctions between closely related SQL candidates. To this end, we
introduce JudgeSQL, a principled framework that redefines SQL candidate
selection through structured reasoning and weighted consensus tournament
mechanism. JudgeSQL develops a reasoning-based SQL judge model that distills
reasoning traces with reinforcement learning guided by verifiable rewards,
enabling accurate and interpretable judgments. Building on this, a weighted
consensus tournament integrates explicit reasoning preferences with implicit
generator confidence, yielding selections that are both more reliable and more
efficient. Extensive experiments on the BIRD benchmark demonstrate that
JudgeSQL exhibits superior SQL judgment capabilities and good cross-scale
generalization and robustness to generator capacity.

Motivation: 医疗中的时间背景对于评估患者健康状况变化很有价值，特别是当既往就诊次数有限且频率不固定时，需要整合历史信息来改善健康监测。

Method: 模型首先使用最近一次就诊的医疗数据估计疾病初始风险，然后利用先前收集的影像学和/或临床生物标志物信息来完善评估。

Result: 整合历史背景将假阳性转换为真阴性，总体特异性提高同时保持高敏感性。整合多达三次既往影像检查信息后，假阳性率从51%降至33%，加入临床数据后进一步降至24%。预测5年内风险时，假阳性率从64%降至9%。

prior visits are limited and their frequency is variable. Our model first
estimates initial risk of disease using medical data from the most recent
patient visit, then refines this assessment using information digested from
previously collected imaging and/or clinical biomarkers. We applied our
framework to prostate cancer (PCa) risk prediction using data from a large
population (28,342 patients, 39,013 magnetic resonance imaging scans, 68,931
blood tests) collected over nearly a decade. For predictions of the risk of
clinically significant PCa at the time of the visit, integrating prior context
directly converted false positives to true negatives, increasing overall
specificity while preserving high sensitivity. False positive rates were
reduced progressively from 51% to 33% when integrating information from up to
three prior imaging examinations, as compared to using data from a single
visit, and were further reduced to 24% when also including additional context
from prior clinical data. For predicting the risk of PCa within five years of
the visit, incorporating prior context reduced false positive rates still
further (64% to 9%). Our findings show that information collected over time
provides relevant context to enhance the specificity of medical risk
prediction. For a wide range of progressive conditions, sufficient reduction of
false positive rates using context could offer a pathway to expand longitudinal
health monitoring programs to large populations with comparatively low baseline
risk of disease, leading to earlier detection and improved health outcomes.

TL;DR: 本文提出了SciRecipe数据集和Thoth模型，通过"草图填充"范式和结构化奖励机制，显著提升了科学实验协议生成的完整性和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型生成的科学实验协议往往不完整或不一致，限制了其在可重复科学研究中的实用性。

Method: 提出"草图填充"范式，将分析、结构化和表达分离；开发结构化组件奖励机制评估步骤粒度、动作顺序和语义保真度；构建Thoth模型，采用分阶段的知识到行动训练过程。

Result: Thoth在多个基准测试中持续超越专有和开源LLM，在步骤对齐、逻辑排序和语义准确性方面取得显著改进。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建可靠的科学助手铺平了道路，能够有效连接知识与实验执行。所有数据、代码和模型将公开发布。

Abstract: The foundation of reproducible science lies in protocols that are precise,
logically ordered, and executable. The autonomous generation of these protocols
through natural language queries could greatly improve the efficiency of the
reproduction process. However, current leading large language models (LLMs)
often generate incomplete or inconsistent protocols, limiting their utility. To
address this limitation, we first introduce SciRecipe, a large-scale dataset of
over 12K structured protocols spanning 27 biological subfields and encompassing
both comprehension and problem-solving tasks. To further improve protocol
generation, we propose the "Sketch-and-Fill" paradigm, which separates
analysis, structuring, and expression to ensure each step is explicit and
verifiable. Complementing this, the structured component-based reward mechanism
evaluates step granularity, action order, and semantic fidelity, aligning model
optimization with experimental reliability. Building on these components, we
develop Thoth, trained through a staged Knowledge-to-Action process that
progresses from knowledge acquisition to operational reasoning and ultimately
to robust, executable protocol generation. Across multiple benchmarks, Thoth
consistently surpasses both proprietary and open-source LLMs, achieving
significant improvements in step alignment, logical sequencing, and semantic
accuracy. Our approach paves the way for reliable scientific assistants that
bridge knowledge with experimental execution. All data, code, and models will
be released publicly.

Abstract: The automation of scientific discovery represents a critical milestone in
Artificial Intelligence (AI) research. However, existing agentic systems for
science suffer from two fundamental limitations: rigid, pre-programmed
workflows that cannot adapt to intermediate findings, and inadequate context
management that hinders long-horizon research. We present
\texttt{freephdlabor}, an open-source multiagent framework featuring
\textit{fully dynamic workflows} determined by real-time agent reasoning and a
\coloremph{\textit{modular architecture}} enabling seamless customization --
users can modify, add, or remove agents to address domain-specific
requirements. The framework provides comprehensive infrastructure including
\textit{automatic context compaction}, \textit{workspace-based communication}
to prevent information degradation, \textit{memory persistence} across
sessions, and \textit{non-blocking human intervention} mechanisms. These
features collectively transform automated research from isolated, single-run
attempts into \textit{continual research programs} that build systematically on
prior explorations and incorporate human feedback. By providing both the
architectural principles and practical implementation for building customizable
co-scientist systems, this work aims to facilitate broader adoption of
automated research across scientific domains, enabling practitioners to deploy
interactive multiagent systems that autonomously conduct end-to-end research --
from ideation through experimentation to publication-ready manuscripts.

TL;DR: 本文提出解决RLHF中两个关键问题的方法：通过排名反馈确保偏好可识别性，以及通过EM-DPO和公平聚合算法处理异质用户偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLHF和DPO方法假设统一标注者偏好并依赖二元比较，忽视了人类评估者的多样性和成对反馈的局限性。

Method: 1) 连接偏好学习与计量经济学，证明二元比较不足以识别潜在用户偏好；2) 开发EM-DPO方法发现潜在标注者类型并训练混合LLM；3) 提出基于最小最大遗憾公平准则的聚合算法。

Result: 建立了生成模型对齐中面向多样化用户的公平性和个性化理论算法框架。

Conclusion: 通过排名反馈和异质偏好整合，为生成模型对齐提供了更公平和个性化的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become central to
aligning large language models with human values, typically by first learning a
reward model from preference data which is then used to update the model with
reinforcement learning. Recent alternatives such as Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) simplify this pipeline by directly optimizing on
preferences. However, both approaches often assume uniform annotator
preferences and rely on binary comparisons, overlooking two key limitations:
the diversity of human evaluators and the limitations of pairwise feedback. In
this work, we address both these issues. First, we connect preference learning
in RLHF with the econometrics literature and show that binary comparisons are
insufficient for identifying latent user preferences from finite user data and
infinite users, while (even incomplete) rankings over three or more responses
ensure identifiability. Second, we introduce methods to incorporate
heterogeneous preferences into alignment algorithms. We develop an
Expectation-Maximization adaptation of DPO that discovers latent annotator
types and trains a mixture of LLMs accordingly. Then we propose an aggregation
algorithm using a min-max regret fairness criterion to produce a single
generative policy with equitable performance guarantees. Together, these
contributions establish a theoretical and algorithmic framework for fairness
and personalization for diverse users in generative model alignment.

Motivation: 需要标准化的方法来评估发票信息提取的准确性，以便比较不同提取方法并识别各字段提取的优缺点。

Method: 使用Docling和LlamaCloud服务对扫描或数字发票进行预处理，识别并提取关键字段如发票号码、日期、总金额和供应商详情。

Result: 建立了一个包含字段级精度、一致性检查失败率和完全匹配准确率的稳健评估框架。

Conclusion: 提出的评估指标为比较不同提取方法提供了标准化方式，并能突出显示字段特定性能的强弱项。

Abstract: This paper presents methods for extracting structured information from
invoice documents and proposes a set of evaluation metrics (EM) to assess the
accuracy of the extracted data against annotated ground truth. The approach
involves pre-processing scanned or digital invoices, applying Docling and
LlamaCloud Services to identify and extract key fields such as invoice number,
date, total amount, and vendor details. To ensure the reliability of the
extraction process, we establish a robust evaluation framework comprising
field-level precision, consistency check failures, and exact match accuracy.
The proposed metrics provide a standardized way to compare different extraction
methods and highlight strengths and weaknesses in field-specific performance.

Abstract: As autonomous agentic AI systems see increasing adoption across
organisations, persistent challenges in alignment, governance, and risk
management threaten to impede deployment at scale. We present AURA (Agent
aUtonomy Risk Assessment), a unified framework designed to detect, quantify,
and mitigate risks arising from agentic AI. Building on recent research and
practical deployments, AURA introduces a gamma-based risk scoring methodology
that balances risk assessment accuracy with computational efficiency and
practical considerations. AURA provides an interactive process to score,
evaluate and mitigate the risks of running one or multiple AI Agents,
synchronously or asynchronously (autonomously). The framework is engineered for
Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) oversight and presents Agent-to-Human (A2H)
communication mechanisms, allowing for seamless integration with agentic
systems for autonomous self-assessment, rendering it interoperable with
established protocols (MCP and A2A) and tools. AURA supports a responsible and
transparent adoption of agentic AI and provides robust risk detection and
mitigation while balancing computational resources, positioning it as a
critical enabler for large-scale, governable agentic AI in enterprise
environments.

TL;DR: 提出了首个将帕金森病评估中的多模态学习构建为多目标优化问题的系统TRIP，解决了模态同步训练和推理依赖问题，并在异步和同步设置下都取得了最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态帕金森病评估方法存在两个主要限制：(1)训练时需要同步所有模态，(2)推理时依赖所有模态，这阻碍了实际应用。

Method: 将多模态学习构建为多目标优化问题，引入基于边界的类别重平衡策略来处理模态内不平衡问题，支持训练和推理时的灵活模态要求。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上，TRIP在异步设置下比最佳基线分别提升16.48、6.89和11.55个百分点，在同步设置下提升4.86和2.30个百分点。

Conclusion: TRIP框架在帕金森病评估中表现出卓越的有效性和适应性，解决了多模态学习中的关键限制问题。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease assessment has garnered growing interest in recent years,
particularly with the advent of sensor data and machine learning techniques.
Among these, multimodal approaches have demonstrated strong performance by
effectively integrating complementary information from various data sources.
However, two major limitations hinder their practical application: (1) the need
to synchronize all modalities during training, and (2) the dependence on all
modalities during inference. To address these issues, we propose the first
Parkinson's assessment system that formulates multimodal learning as a
multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. This not only allows for more
flexible modality requirements during both training and inference, but also
handles modality collapse issue during multimodal information fusion. In
addition, to mitigate the imbalance within individual modalities, we introduce
a margin-based class rebalancing strategy to enhance category learning. We
conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets under both synchronous
and asynchronous settings. The results show that our framework-Towards Relaxed
InPuts (TRIP)-achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the best
baselines by 16.48, 6.89, and 11.55 percentage points in the asynchronous
setting, and by 4.86 and 2.30 percentage points in the synchronous setting,
highlighting its effectiveness and adaptability.

artificial intelligence across critical domains including law, healthcare, and
finance, raising urgent questions about trust and transparency. This study
investigates the relationship between explainability and user trust in AI
systems through a quantitative experimental design. Using an interactive,
web-based loan approval simulation, we compare how different types of
explanations, ranging from basic feature importance to interactive
counterfactuals influence perceived trust. Results suggest that interactivity
enhances both user engagement and confidence, and that the clarity and
relevance of explanations are key determinants of trust. These findings
contribute empirical evidence to the growing field of human-centered
explainable AI, highlighting measurable effects of explainability design on
user perception

TL;DR: Dialectica框架通过结构化对话、记忆、自我反思和政策约束的上下文编辑，使AI代理在复杂问题中发展专业知识，显著提升了代理在Elo评分和AlphaRank等指标上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂多维问题（如司法框架、环境污染等）时，现有LLM缺乏通过经验发展专业知识的内生机制，需要一种能够促进代理在对话中学习和进化的框架。

Method: 提出Dialectica框架，代理在定义的主题上进行结构化对话，配备记忆、自我反思和策略约束的上下文编辑功能，将讨论视为隐式元强化学习过程。

Result: 实验显示，在两种模型架构上，启用基于反思的上下文编辑的代理在Elo评分、标准化Bradley-Terry-Davidson能力和AlphaRank质量上均优于基线版本。

Conclusion: 对话驱动的上下文演化是在开放不可验证领域中实现针对性专业知识放大的可行路径，定性和定量证据一致支持这一结论。

Abstract: So-called `wicked problems', those involving complex multi-dimensional
settings, non-verifiable outcomes, heterogeneous impacts and a lack of single
objectively correct answers, have plagued humans throughout history. Modern
examples include decisions over justice frameworks, solving environmental
pollution, planning for pandemic resilience and food security. The use of
state-of-the-art artificial intelligence systems (notably Large Language
Model-based agents) collaborating with humans on solving such problems is being
actively explored. While the abilities of LLMs can be improved by, for example,
fine-tuning, hand-crafted system prompts and scaffolding with external tools,
LLMs lack endogenous mechanisms to develop expertise through experience in such
settings. This work address this gap with Dialectica, a framework where agents
engage in structured dialogue on defined topics, augmented by memory,
self-reflection, and policy-constrained context editing. Formally, discussion
is viewed as an implicit meta-reinforcement learning process. The
`dialogue-trained' agents are evaluated post-hoc using judged pairwise
comparisons of elicited responses. Across two model architectures (locally run
Qwen3:30b and OpenAI's o4-mini) results show that enabling reflection-based
context editing during discussion produces agents which dominate their baseline
counterparts on Elo scores, normalized Bradley-Terry-Davidson ability, and
AlphaRank mass. The predicted signatures of learning are observed qualitatively
in statement and reflection logs, where reflections identify weaknesses and
reliably shape subsequent statements. Agreement between quantitative and
qualitative evidence supports dialogue-driven context evolution as a practical
path to targeted expertise amplification in open non-verifiable domains.

Abstract: As AI chatbots gain adoption in clinical medicine, developing effective
frameworks for complex, emerging diseases presents significant challenges. We
developed and evaluated six Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) corpus
configurations for Long COVID (LC) clinical question answering, ranging from
expert-curated sources to large-scale literature databases. Our evaluation
employed an LLM-as-a-judge framework across faithfulness, relevance, and
comprehensiveness metrics using LongCOVID-CQ, a novel dataset of
expert-generated clinical questions. Our RAG corpus configuration combining
clinical guidelines with high-quality systematic reviews consistently
outperformed both narrow single-guideline approaches and large-scale literature
databases. Our findings suggest that for emerging diseases, retrieval grounded
in curated secondary reviews provides an optimal balance between narrow
consensus documents and unfiltered primary literature, supporting clinical
decision-making while avoiding information overload and oversimplified
guidance. We propose Guide-RAG, a chatbot system and accompanying evaluation
framework that integrates both curated expert knowledge and comprehensive
literature databases to effectively answer LC clinical questions.
