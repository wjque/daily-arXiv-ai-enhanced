### [1] [ArtiLatent: Realistic Articulated 3D Object Generation via Structured Latents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21432)
*Honghua Chen,Yushi Lan,Yongwei Chen,Xingang Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ArtiLatent是一个生成框架，通过联合建模部件几何和关节动态，在统一潜在空间中合成具有精细几何、准确关节和逼真外观的3D物体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D物体生成方法难以同时处理精细几何、准确关节和逼真外观，特别是在不同关节配置下保持视觉真实感。

Method: 使用变分自编码器将稀疏体素表示和关节属性嵌入统一潜在空间，然后训练潜在扩散模型进行多样化采样，并引入关节感知的高斯解码器重建逼真3D形状。

Result: 在PartNet-Mobility和ACD数据集上的实验表明，ArtiLatent在几何一致性和外观保真度方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为关节化3D物体合成和操作提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose ArtiLatent, a generative framework that synthesizes human-made 3D
objects with fine-grained geometry, accurate articulation, and realistic
appearance. Our approach jointly models part geometry and articulation dynamics
by embedding sparse voxel representations and associated articulation
properties, including joint type, axis, origin, range, and part category, into
a unified latent space via a variational autoencoder. A latent diffusion model
is then trained over this space to enable diverse yet physically plausible
sampling. To reconstruct photorealistic 3D shapes, we introduce an
articulation-aware Gaussian decoder that accounts for articulation-dependent
visibility changes (e.g., revealing the interior of a drawer when opened). By
conditioning appearance decoding on articulation state, our method assigns
plausible texture features to regions that are typically occluded in static
poses, significantly improving visual realism across articulation
configurations. Extensive experiments on furniture-like objects from
PartNet-Mobility and ACD datasets demonstrate that ArtiLatent outperforms
existing approaches in geometric consistency and appearance fidelity. Our
framework provides a scalable solution for articulated 3D object synthesis and
manipulation.

### [2] [Group Inertial Poser: Multi-Person Pose and Global Translation from Sparse Inertial Sensors and Ultra-Wideband Ranging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21654)
*Ying Xue,Jiaxi Jiang,Rayan Armani,Dominik Hollidt,Yi-Chi Liao,Christian Holz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于稀疏可穿戴IMU和UWB距离测量的多人全身运动跟踪方法，通过融合惯性观测和传感器间距离信息来精确估计3D姿态和全局轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纯IMU方法在多人场景下存在全局位置估计和相对定位不准确的问题，因为惯性线索是自参考的，缺乏对他人位置的直接空间参考。

Method: 使用IMU观测和UWB测距的传感器间距离作为输入，通过结构化状态空间模型整合时间运动模式，并采用新颖的两步优化方法利用估计距离来跟踪全局轨迹。

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据上的评估显示，该方法在准确性和鲁棒性方面优于现有最先进方法，并发布了首个IMU+UWB双人跟踪数据集GIP-DB。

Conclusion: IMU+UWB结合的多人运动捕捉方法在野外环境中具有良好前景，能够实现精确的3D姿态估计和全局轨迹跟踪。

Abstract: Tracking human full-body motion using sparse wearable inertial measurement
units (IMUs) overcomes the limitations of occlusion and instrumentation of the
environment inherent in vision-based approaches. However, purely IMU-based
tracking compromises translation estimates and accurate relative positioning
between individuals, as inertial cues are inherently self-referential and
provide no direct spatial reference for others. In this paper, we present a
novel approach for robustly estimating body poses and global translation for
multiple individuals by leveraging the distances between sparse wearable
sensors - both on each individual and across multiple individuals. Our method
Group Inertial Poser estimates these absolute distances between pairs of
sensors from ultra-wideband ranging (UWB) and fuses them with inertial
observations as input into structured state-space models to integrate temporal
motion patterns for precise 3D pose estimation. Our novel two-step optimization
further leverages the estimated distances for accurately tracking people's
global trajectories through the world. We also introduce GIP-DB, the first
IMU+UWB dataset for two-person tracking, which comprises 200 minutes of motion
recordings from 14 participants. In our evaluation, Group Inertial Poser
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness across
synthetic and real-world data, showing the promise of IMU+UWB-based multi-human
motion capture in the wild. Code, models, dataset:

### [3] [WorldGrow: Generating Infinite 3D World](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21682)
*Sikuang Li,Chen Yang,Jiemin Fang,Taoran Yi,Jia Lu,Jiazhong Cen,Lingxi Xie,Wei Shen,Qi Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WorldGrow是一个分层框架，用于生成可无限扩展的3D场景，通过利用预训练3D模型的生成先验，实现几何一致性和真实外观的大规模连续环境生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法面临关键挑战：2D提升方法存在视图间几何和外观不一致问题，3D隐式表示难以扩展，当前3D基础模型多为对象中心，限制了场景级生成的应用。

Method: 提出三个核心组件：(1)数据筛选流程提取高质量场景块用于训练；(2)3D块修复机制实现上下文感知的场景扩展；(3)从粗到细的生成策略确保全局布局合理性和局部几何/纹理保真度。

Result: 在大型3D-FRONT数据集上评估，WorldGrow在几何重建方面达到SOTA性能，同时独特支持具有照片级真实感和结构一致输出的无限场景生成。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了构建大规模虚拟环境的能力，并为构建未来世界模型提供了潜力。

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of generating the infinitely extendable 3D world --
large, continuous environments with coherent geometry and realistic appearance.
Existing methods face key challenges: 2D-lifting approaches suffer from
geometric and appearance inconsistencies across views, 3D implicit
representations are hard to scale up, and current 3D foundation models are
mostly object-centric, limiting their applicability to scene-level generation.
Our key insight is leveraging strong generation priors from pre-trained 3D
models for structured scene block generation. To this end, we propose
WorldGrow, a hierarchical framework for unbounded 3D scene synthesis. Our
method features three core components: (1) a data curation pipeline that
extracts high-quality scene blocks for training, making the 3D structured
latent representations suitable for scene generation; (2) a 3D block inpainting
mechanism that enables context-aware scene extension; and (3) a coarse-to-fine
generation strategy that ensures both global layout plausibility and local
geometric/textural fidelity. Evaluated on the large-scale 3D-FRONT dataset,
WorldGrow achieves SOTA performance in geometry reconstruction, while uniquely
supporting infinite scene generation with photorealistic and structurally
consistent outputs. These results highlight its capability for constructing
large-scale virtual environments and potential for building future world
models.

### [4] [Preventing Shortcuts in Adapter Training via Providing the Shortcuts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20887)
*Anujraaj Argo Goyal,Guocheng Gordon Qian,Huseyin Coskun,Aarush Gupta,Himmy Tam,Daniil Ostashev,Ju Hu,Dhritiman Sagar,Sergey Tulyakov,Kfir Aberman,Kuan-Chieh Jackson Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training方法，通过在适配器训练时提供干扰因素的捷径路径，防止适配器学习到目标属性与干扰因素的虚假相关性，从而提高生成质量和文本提示遵循能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于适配器的训练方法在从单张图像学习目标属性时，容易将目标属性与姿势、表情、光照等干扰因素纠缠在一起，这种虚假相关性限制了模型的泛化能力和文本提示遵循能力。

Method: 在适配器训练期间，通过ControlNet或LoRA等辅助模块为干扰因素提供捷径路径，消除适配器学习这些干扰因素的动机，然后在推理时移除这些辅助模块。

Result: 在面部和全身身份注入等任务中，该方法提高了生成质量、多样性和文本提示遵循能力。

Conclusion: 在大模型时代，寻求解耦表示的最有效路径可能是为不应该学习的内容建立捷径。

Abstract: Adapter-based training has emerged as a key mechanism for extending the
capabilities of powerful foundation image generators, enabling personalized and
stylized text-to-image synthesis. These adapters are typically trained to
capture a specific target attribute, such as subject identity, using
single-image reconstruction objectives. However, because the input image
inevitably contains a mixture of visual factors, adapters are prone to entangle
the target attribute with incidental ones, such as pose, expression, and
lighting. This spurious correlation problem limits generalization and obstructs
the model's ability to adhere to the input text prompt. In this work, we
uncover a simple yet effective solution: provide the very shortcuts we wish to
eliminate during adapter training. In Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training,
confounding factors are routed through auxiliary modules, such as ControlNet or
LoRA, eliminating the incentive for the adapter to internalize them. The
auxiliary modules are then removed during inference. When applied to tasks like
facial and full-body identity injection, our approach improves generation
quality, diversity, and prompt adherence. These results point to a general
design principle in the era of large models: when seeking disentangled
representations, the most effective path may be to establish shortcuts for what
should NOT be learned.

### [5] [Video-As-Prompt: Unified Semantic Control for Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20888)
*Yuxuan Bian,Xin Chen,Zenan Li,Tiancheng Zhi,Shen Sang,Linjie Luo,Qiang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video-As-Prompt (VAP) 提出了一种新的视频生成范式，通过参考视频作为语义提示来引导冻结的视频扩散变换器，实现了统一、可泛化的语义控制，在零样本泛化和各种下游应用方面表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频生成中统一、可泛化语义控制的关键挑战，现有方法要么通过基于结构的控制引入伪影，要么依赖不可泛化的条件特定微调或任务特定架构。

Method: 使用参考视频作为直接语义提示，通过插拔式混合变换器专家引导冻结的视频扩散变换器，采用时间偏置位置嵌入来消除虚假映射先验，实现鲁棒的上下文检索。

Result: 作为单一统一模型，VAP 在开源方法中达到了新的最先进水平，获得了38.7%的用户偏好率，可与领先的条件特定商业模型相媲美。

Conclusion: VAP 在零样本泛化和支持各种下游应用方面的强大能力，标志着向通用可控视频生成迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Unified, generalizable semantic control in video generation remains a
critical open challenge. Existing methods either introduce artifacts by
enforcing inappropriate pixel-wise priors from structure-based controls, or
rely on non-generalizable, condition-specific finetuning or task-specific
architectures. We introduce Video-As-Prompt (VAP), a new paradigm that reframes
this problem as in-context generation. VAP leverages a reference video as a
direct semantic prompt, guiding a frozen Video Diffusion Transformer (DiT) via
a plug-and-play Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) expert. This architecture
prevents catastrophic forgetting and is guided by a temporally biased position
embedding that eliminates spurious mapping priors for robust context retrieval.
To power this approach and catalyze future research, we built VAP-Data, the
largest dataset for semantic-controlled video generation with over 100K paired
videos across 100 semantic conditions. As a single unified model, VAP sets a
new state-of-the-art for open-source methods, achieving a 38.7% user preference
rate that rivals leading condition-specific commercial models. VAP's strong
zero-shot generalization and support for various downstream applications mark a
significant advance toward general-purpose, controllable video generation.

### [6] [Focal Modulation and Bidirectional Feature Fusion Network for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20933)
*Moin Safdar,Shahzaib Iqbal,Mehwish Mehmood,Mubeen Ghafoor,Tariq M. Khan,Imran Razzak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FM-BFF-Net网络，结合CNN和Transformer，使用焦点调制注意力机制和双向特征融合模块，提升医学图像分割的边界精度和对病变变化的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割对临床诊断和治疗规划至关重要，但传统CNN难以捕获全局上下文信息和长距离依赖关系，影响对复杂边界和多种尺寸结构的精确分割。

Method: 结合CNN和Transformer架构，采用焦点调制注意力机制增强上下文感知，引入双向特征融合模块实现编码器和解码器跨尺度表示的高效交互。

Result: 在8个公开数据集（包括息肉检测、皮肤病变分割和超声成像）上的实验表明，FM-BFF-Net在Jaccard指数和Dice系数上持续超越现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: FM-BFF-Net通过融合CNN和Transformer的优势，有效提升了医学图像分割的性能，在各种医学成像场景中展现出良好的有效性和适应性。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is essential for clinical applications such as
disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease development monitoring
because it provides precise morphological and spatial information on anatomical
structures that directly influence treatment decisions. Convolutional neural
networks significantly impact image segmentation; however, since convolution
operations are local, capturing global contextual information and long-range
dependencies is still challenging. Their capacity to precisely segment
structures with complicated borders and a variety of sizes is impacted by this
restriction. Since transformers use self-attention methods to capture global
context and long-range dependencies efficiently, integrating transformer-based
architecture with CNNs is a feasible approach to overcoming these challenges.
To address these challenges, we propose the Focal Modulation and Bidirectional
Feature Fusion Network for Medical Image Segmentation, referred to as
FM-BFF-Net in the remainder of this paper. The network combines convolutional
and transformer components, employs a focal modulation attention mechanism to
refine context awareness, and introduces a bidirectional feature fusion module
that enables efficient interaction between encoder and decoder representations
across scales. Through this design, FM-BFF-Net enhances boundary precision and
robustness to variations in lesion size, shape, and contrast. Extensive
experiments on eight publicly available datasets, including polyp detection,
skin lesion segmentation, and ultrasound imaging, show that FM-BFF-Net
consistently surpasses recent state-of-the-art methods in Jaccard index and
Dice coefficient, confirming its effectiveness and adaptability for diverse
medical imaging scenarios.

### [7] [Generative Point Tracking with Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20951)
*Mattie Tesfaldet,Adam W. Harley,Konstantinos G. Derpanis,Derek Nowrouzezahrai,Christopher Pal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GenPT是一个生成式点轨迹跟踪框架，通过流匹配方法建模多模态轨迹，在遮挡情况下显著提升跟踪精度，同时在可见点上保持竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的判别式模型在存在不确定性（如遮挡和外观变化）时只能回归到均值或众数，无法捕捉多模态轨迹。

Method: 提出生成式点轨迹跟踪器(GenPT)，采用流匹配公式结合迭代细化、窗口相关先验和点坐标专用方差调度，在推理时使用最佳优先搜索策略。

Result: 在PointOdyssey、Dynamic Replica和TAP-Vid基准测试中表现优异，特别在遮挡点跟踪上达到最先进水平，同时可见点跟踪精度保持竞争力。

Conclusion: GenPT能够有效捕捉点轨迹的多模态特性，在遮挡场景下显著提升跟踪性能，为不确定性条件下的点跟踪提供了生成式解决方案。

Abstract: Tracking a point through a video can be a challenging task due to uncertainty
arising from visual obfuscations, such as appearance changes and occlusions.
Although current state-of-the-art discriminative models excel in regressing
long-term point trajectory estimates -- even through occlusions -- they are
limited to regressing to a mean (or mode) in the presence of uncertainty, and
fail to capture multi-modality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce
Generative Point Tracker (GenPT), a generative framework for modelling
multi-modal trajectories. GenPT is trained with a novel flow matching
formulation that combines the iterative refinement of discriminative trackers,
a window-dependent prior for cross-window consistency, and a variance schedule
tuned specifically for point coordinates. We show how our model's generative
capabilities can be leveraged to improve point trajectory estimates by
utilizing a best-first search strategy on generated samples during inference,
guided by the model's own confidence of its predictions. Empirically, we
evaluate GenPT against the current state of the art on the standard
PointOdyssey, Dynamic Replica, and TAP-Vid benchmarks. Further, we introduce a
TAP-Vid variant with additional occlusions to assess occluded point tracking
performance and highlight our model's ability to capture multi-modality. GenPT
is capable of capturing the multi-modality in point trajectories, which
translates to state-of-the-art tracking accuracy on occluded points, while
maintaining competitive tracking accuracy on visible points compared to extant
discriminative point trackers.

### [8] [3DReasonKnee: Advancing Grounded Reasoning in Medical Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20967)
*Sraavya Sambara,Sung Eun Kim,Xiaoman Zhang,Luyang Luo,Shreya Johri,Mohammed Baharoon,Du Hyun Ro,Pranav Rajpurkar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了3DReasonKnee数据集，这是首个用于3D医学图像接地推理的数据集，包含494k个高质量五元组，支持视觉语言模型在3D医学图像中进行解剖区域定位和逐步推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在3D医学图像中难以准确定位解剖区域并进行逐步推理，这与临床诊断工作流程不匹配，影响了临床医生与AI的信任合作。

Method: 创建了3DReasonKnee数据集，包含7,970个3D膝关节MRI体积，每个样本包括：3D MRI体积、针对特定解剖区域的诊断问题、3D边界框定位、临床医生生成的诊断推理步骤、结构化严重程度评估。

Result: 建立了ReasonKnee-Bench评估框架，对五种最先进的视觉语言模型进行基准测试，为3D接地推理提供了性能基线。

Conclusion: 3DReasonKnee作为骨科医生诊断专业知识的存储库，为推进多模态医学AI系统向3D、临床对齐的定位决策能力提供了重要测试平台。

Abstract: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to ground anatomical regions
in 3D medical images and reason about them in a step-by-step manner, a key
requirement of real-world diagnostic assessment. This ability is essential for
aligning model outputs with the diagnostic workflows clinicians use in
practice, enabling trustworthy clinician-AI collaboration. Existing 3D datasets
provide localization labels, but none support this "grounded reasoning"
ability. To address this gap, we introduce 3DReasonKnee, the first 3D grounded
reasoning dataset for medical images, which provides 494k high-quality
quintuples derived from 7,970 3D knee MRI volumes. Each quintuple includes: (1)
the 3D MRI volume, (2) a diagnostic question targeting a specific anatomical
region (3) a 3D bounding box localizing the relevant anatomical structures, (4)
clinician-generated diagnostic reasoning steps that explicitly detail the 3D
reasoning process, and (5) structured severity assessments for the relevant
anatomical region. The creation and validation of 3DReasonKnee, involving over
450 hours of expert clinician time for manually segmenting MRIs and generating
reasoning chains, ensures its superior quality and clinical relevance. We
establish ReasonKnee-Bench to evaluate localization and diagnostic accuracy,
providing insight into VLM ability to perform grounding and severity assessment
across anatomical regions and diagnostic inquiries. We benchmark five
state-of-the-art VLMs, providing baseline performance for ReasonKnee-Bench. By
providing this unique resource of expert-annotated 3D reasoning pathways,
3DReasonKnee serves as a repository of orthopedic surgeons' diagnostic
expertise and offers a vital testbed for advancing multimodal medical AI
systems towards 3D, clinically aligned, localized decision-making capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用热偏振线索进行详细3D形状重建的新方法，该方法不依赖光照和材质属性，通过长波红外偏振成像解决了可见光偏振分析中的歧义问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D重建方法依赖光照和材质属性，而热偏振成像能够克服这些限制，特别是在透明、半透明和异质物体上实现更精确的重建。

Method: 建立了偏振观测的一般理论，利用长波红外偏振成像避免可见光偏振分析的歧义，提出基于多视角热偏振图像的3D形状恢复方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能有效重建透明、半透明和异质物体的精细细节，性能优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 热偏振成像为3D形状重建提供了一种独立于光照和材质的新途径，特别适用于传统方法难以处理的物体类型。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for detailed 3D shape reconstruction
utilizing thermal polarization cues. Unlike state-of-the-art methods, the
proposed approach is independent of illumination and material properties. In
this paper, we formulate a general theory of polarization observation and show
that long-wave infrared (LWIR) polarimetric imaging is free from the
ambiguities that affect visible polarization analyses. Subsequently, we propose
a method for recovering detailed 3D shapes using multi-view thermal
polarimetric images. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
effectively reconstructs fine details in transparent, translucent, and
heterogeneous objects, outperforming existing techniques.

### [10] [VESSA: Video-based objEct-centric Self-Supervised Adaptation for Visual Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20994)
*Jesimon Barreto,Carlos Caetano,André Araujo,William Robson Schwartz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VESSA是一种基于视频的无监督自适应方法，通过多视角物体中心视频对视觉基础模型进行自监督微调，无需标注即可适应新领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉基础模型在分布偏移和标注稀缺领域性能下降的问题，传统监督微调不可行，而现有的自监督学习策略对视觉编码器模型效果不佳。

Method: 采用自蒸馏范式，利用多视角物体中心视频进行自监督微调，通过精心调整预测头和参数高效适应技术，防止模型遗忘预训练知识。

Result: 在3个视觉基础模型和2个数据集上的实验表明，VESSA在下游分类任务中相比基础模型和先前自适应方法实现了持续改进。

Conclusion: VESSA提供了一种有效的无监督自适应方法，能够利用多视角物体观察学习对多样化捕获条件的鲁棒性，无需标注即可提升模型性能。

Abstract: Foundation models have advanced computer vision by enabling strong
performance across diverse tasks through large-scale pretraining and supervised
fine-tuning. However, they may underperform in domains with distribution shifts
and scarce labels, where supervised fine-tuning may be infeasible. While
continued self-supervised learning for model adaptation is common for
generative language models, this strategy has not proven effective for
vision-centric encoder models. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel
formulation of self-supervised fine-tuning for vision foundation models, where
the model is adapted to a new domain without requiring annotations, leveraging
only short multi-view object-centric videos. Our method is referred to as
VESSA: Video-based objEct-centric Self-Supervised Adaptation for visual
foundation models. VESSA's training technique is based on a self-distillation
paradigm, where it is critical to carefully tune prediction heads and deploy
parameter-efficient adaptation techniques - otherwise, the model may quickly
forget its pretrained knowledge and reach a degraded state. VESSA benefits
significantly from multi-view object observations sourced from different frames
in an object-centric video, efficiently learning robustness to varied capture
conditions, without the need of annotations. Through comprehensive experiments
with 3 vision foundation models on 2 datasets, VESSA demonstrates consistent
improvements in downstream classification tasks, compared to the base models
and previous adaptation methods. Code is publicly available at
https://github.com/jesimonbarreto/VESSA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于工业环境中未见物体2D检测的标准化即插即用流程，通过低光图像增强和基于基础模型的背景去除来减少域偏移和背景伪影，显著提升检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有6D姿态估计流程在复杂工业环境下性能下降，检测成为关键瓶颈，需要解决在杂乱、光照差和复杂背景等挑战条件下的检测问题。

Method: 基于当前SOTA基线，采用低光图像增强和基于开放词汇检测的背景去除，抑制原始SAM输出中的假阳性，为下游姿态估计提供更可靠的检测结果。

Result: 在BOP真实工业bin-picking基准测试中，该方法显著提升检测精度，同时推理开销可忽略不计。

Conclusion: 该方法在工业环境中对未见物体的2D检测具有有效性和实用性，能够显著提升下游6D姿态估计的性能。

Abstract: Accurate 6D pose estimation is essential for robotic manipulation in
industrial environments. Existing pipelines typically rely on off-the-shelf
object detectors followed by cropping and pose refinement, but their
performance degrades under challenging conditions such as clutter, poor
lighting, and complex backgrounds, making detection the critical bottleneck. In
this work, we introduce a standardized and plug-in pipeline for 2D detection of
unseen objects in industrial settings. Based on current SOTA baselines, our
approach reduces domain shift and background artifacts through low-light image
enhancement and background removal guided by open-vocabulary detection with
foundation models. This design suppresses the false positives prevalent in raw
SAM outputs, yielding more reliable detections for downstream pose estimation.
Extensive experiments on real-world industrial bin-picking benchmarks from BOP
demonstrate that our method significantly boosts detection accuracy while
incurring negligible inference overhead, showing the effectiveness and
practicality of the proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地震后及时评估结构完整性对公共安全和应急响应至关重要，暴露钢筋的数量和分布能反映结构损伤程度。

Method: 基于深度学习框架，使用YOLOv11模型检测裂缝、剥落和暴露钢筋，通过微调、数据增强和公共数据集测试，建立自动分类和损伤等级评估的混合框架。

Result: 开发了能自动识别建筑物内外和结构构件，检测损伤特征并区分不同损伤等级的可靠系统。

Conclusion: 研究表明通过图像数据收集、标注和深度学习方法，可以在各种损伤背景下实现快速自动化的灾后损伤检测。

Abstract: Timely assessment of integrity of structures after seismic events is crucial
for public safety and emergency response. This study focuses on assessing the
structural damage conditions using deep learning methods to detect exposed
steel reinforcement in concrete buildings and bridges after large earthquakes.
Steel bars are typically exposed after concrete spalling or large flexural or
shear cracks. The amount and distribution of exposed steel reinforcement is an
indication of structural damage and degradation. To automatically detect
exposed steel bars, new datasets of images collected after the 2023 Turkey
Earthquakes were labeled to represent a wide variety of damaged concrete
structures. The proposed method builds upon a deep learning framework, enhanced
with fine-tuning, data augmentation, and testing on public datasets. An
automated classification framework is developed that can be used to identify
inside/outside buildings and structural components. Then, a YOLOv11 (You Only
Look Once) model is trained to detect cracking and spalling damage and exposed
bars. Another YOLO model is finetuned to distinguish different categories of
structural damage levels. All these trained models are used to create a hybrid
framework to automatically and reliably determine the damage levels from input
images. This research demonstrates that rapid and automated damage detection
following disasters is achievable across diverse damage contexts by utilizing
image data collection, annotation, and deep learning approaches.

TL;DR: ZING-3D是一个零样本3D场景图生成框架，利用预训练基础模型实现开放词汇识别，支持增量更新和3D几何接地，适用于机器人应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D场景图生成方法局限于单视角、不支持增量更新、缺乏3D几何接地，这些对于具身场景至关重要。

Method: 利用VLM推理生成丰富的2D场景图，通过深度信息将其接地到3D空间，节点包含开放词汇对象特征、3D位置和语义上下文，边捕获空间和语义关系及物体间距离。

Result: 在Replica和HM3D数据集上的实验表明，ZING-3D能有效捕获空间和关系知识，无需任务特定训练。

Conclusion: ZING-3D框架成功实现了零样本3D场景图生成，支持增量更新和几何接地，为下游机器人应用提供了有效的场景理解能力。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about complex 3D environments requires structured
scene representations that capture not only objects but also their semantic and
spatial relationships. While recent works on 3D scene graph generation have
leveraged pretrained VLMs without task-specific fine-tuning, they are largely
confined to single-view settings, fail to support incremental updates as new
observations arrive and lack explicit geometric grounding in 3D space, all of
which are essential for embodied scenarios. In this paper, we propose, ZING-3D,
a framework that leverages the vast knowledge of pretrained foundation models
to enable open-vocabulary recognition and generate a rich semantic
representation of the scene in a zero-shot manner while also enabling
incremental updates and geometric grounding in 3D space, making it suitable for
downstream robotics applications. Our approach leverages VLM reasoning to
generate a rich 2D scene graph, which is grounded in 3D using depth
information. Nodes represent open-vocabulary objects with features, 3D
locations, and semantic context, while edges capture spatial and semantic
relations with inter-object distances. Our experiments on scenes from the
Replica and HM3D dataset show that ZING-3D is effective at capturing spatial
and relational knowledge without the need of task-specific training.

TL;DR: WaveSeg是一种新颖的解码器架构，通过联合优化空间和小波域的特征细化，利用小波域频率先验和基于Mamba的注意力机制，在语义分割任务中实现了高效精确的分割效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语义分割网络过度依赖强大的预训练编码器，但使用简单的解码器，导致语义上下文和细粒度细节保留之间的权衡不够理想。

Method: 提出WaveSeg解码器架构：1）从输入图像学习高频分量作为显式先验；2）应用双域操作（DDO）进行多尺度融合；3）提出频谱分解注意力（SDA）块，利用Mamba的线性复杂度长程建模增强高频结构细节；4）应用重参数化卷积在小波域保持低频语义完整性；5）残差引导融合整合多尺度特征和边界感知表示。

Result: 在标准基准测试上的广泛实验表明，WaveSeg在定量和定性上都持续优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: WaveSeg通过小波域频率先验和基于Mamba的注意力机制，实现了高效且精确的语义分割，在语义和结构细节方面都表现出色。

Abstract: While recent semantic segmentation networks heavily rely on powerful
pretrained encoders, most employ simplistic decoders, leading to suboptimal
trade-offs between semantic context and fine-grained detail preservation. To
address this, we propose a novel decoder architecture, WaveSeg, which jointly
optimizes feature refinement in spatial and wavelet domains. Specifically,
high-frequency components are first learned from input images as explicit
priors to reinforce boundary details at early stages. A multi-scale fusion
mechanism, Dual Domain Operation (DDO), is then applied, and the novel Spectrum
Decomposition Attention (SDA) block is proposed, which is developed to leverage
Mamba's linear-complexity long-range modeling to enhance high-frequency
structural details. Meanwhile, reparameterized convolutions are applied to
preserve low-frequency semantic integrity in the wavelet domain. Finally, a
residual-guided fusion integrates multi-scale features with boundary-aware
representations at native resolution, producing semantically and structurally
rich feature maps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
that WaveSeg, leveraging wavelet-domain frequency prior with Mamba-based
attention, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both
quantitatively and qualitatively, achieving efficient and precise segmentation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合专家文本概念和视觉语言模型的框架，用于指导肠神经丛分类，在Hirschsprung病诊断中优于传统CNN模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习模型在肠神经丛分类任务中表现良好但缺乏可解释性，且不符合医生的决策方式，需要将专家知识融入模型。

Method: 使用基于对比语言-图像预训练的视觉语言模型，整合从医学教科书和论文中提取的专家文本概念，通过LLM生成提示并经团队审核后使用QuiltNet编码。

Result: 模型在各项分类指标上均优于VGG-19、ResNet-18和ResNet-50等CNN模型，准确率达到83.9%，精确率86.6%，特异性87.6%。

Conclusion: 多模态学习在组织病理学中具有潜力，整合专家知识能产生更具临床相关性的模型输出。

Abstract: Hirschsprung's disease is defined as the congenital absence of ganglion cells
in some segment(s) of the colon. The muscle cannot make coordinated movements
to propel stool in that section, most commonly leading to obstruction. The
diagnosis and treatment for this disease require a clear identification of
different region(s) of the myenteric plexus, where ganglion cells should be
present, on the microscopic view of the tissue slide. While deep learning
approaches, such as Convolutional Neural Networks, have performed very well in
this task, they are often treated as black boxes, with minimal understanding
gained from them, and may not conform to how a physician makes decisions. In
this study, we propose a novel framework that integrates expert-derived textual
concepts into a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training-based vision-language
model to guide plexus classification. Using prompts derived from expert sources
(e.g., medical textbooks and papers) generated by large language models and
reviewed by our team before being encoded with QuiltNet, our approach aligns
clinically relevant semantic cues with visual features. Experimental results
show that the proposed model demonstrated superior discriminative capability
across different classification metrics as it outperformed CNN-based models,
including VGG-19, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50; achieving an accuracy of 83.9%, a
precision of 86.6%, and a specificity of 87.6%. These findings highlight the
potential of multi-modal learning in histopathology and underscore the value of
incorporating expert knowledge for more clinically relevant model outputs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于直方图的Retinex模型（HistRetinex），用于快速低光照图像增强，通过将Retinex模型从空间域扩展到直方图域，显著提升了处理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Retinex方法在处理大尺寸图像时耗时较长，需要一种更高效的增强方法。

Method: 定义直方图位置矩阵和计数矩阵，构建两级优化模型，通过迭代求解光照和反射率直方图，最后通过直方图匹配实现图像增强。

Result: 在1000*664分辨率图像上仅需1.86秒，比现有方法至少节省6.67秒，在可见性和性能指标上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HistRetinex在保持增强质量的同时显著提升了处理速度，为实时低光照图像增强提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Retinex-based low-light image enhancement methods are widely used due to
their excellent performance. However, most of them are time-consuming for
large-sized images. This paper extends the Retinex model from the spatial
domain to the histogram domain, and proposes a novel histogram-based Retinex
model for fast low-light image enhancement, named HistRetinex. Firstly, we
define the histogram location matrix and the histogram count matrix, which
establish the relationship among histograms of the illumination, reflectance
and the low-light image. Secondly, based on the prior information and the
histogram-based Retinex model, we construct a novel two-level optimization
model. Through solving the optimization model, we give the iterative formulas
of the illumination histogram and the reflectance histogram, respectively.
Finally, we enhance the low-light image through matching its histogram with the
one provided by HistRetinex. Experimental results demonstrate that the
HistRetinex outperforms existing enhancement methods in both visibility and
performance metrics, while executing 1.86 seconds on 1000*664 resolution
images, achieving a minimum time saving of 6.67 seconds.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了主动视觉推理(AVR)任务，将视觉推理扩展到部分可观察的交互环境中，需要智能体通过物理动作主动获取信息、整合多步观察并进行动态决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型主要在静态、完全可观察的环境中进行视觉推理，而现实世界信息往往不完整。受人类主动探索环境的启发，需要开发能够主动获取信息的推理能力。

Method: 引入CLEVR-AVR仿真基准和AVR-152k大规模数据集，包含丰富的思维链标注。开发了PhysVLM-AVR模型，在更高阶马尔可夫决策过程中训练智能体进行不确定性识别、信息增益预测和动作选择。

Result: PhysVLM-AVR在CLEVR-AVR、具身推理(OpenEQA、RoboVQA)和被动视觉推理(GeoMath、Geometry30K)任务上达到最先进性能。分析显示当前具身MLLM虽然能检测信息不完整性，但在主动获取和整合新信息方面存在困难。

Conclusion: 主动视觉推理是视觉推理的重要扩展方向，现有模型在主动推理能力上存在根本性差距，需要开发能够主动交互获取信息的智能体。

Abstract: Visual reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has primarily
been studied in static, fully observable settings, limiting their effectiveness
in real-world environments where information is often incomplete due to
occlusion or limited field of view. Humans, in contrast, actively explore and
interact with their environment-moving, examining, and manipulating objects-to
gather information through a closed-loop process integrating perception,
reasoning, and action. Inspired by this human capability, we introduce the
Active Visual Reasoning (AVR) task, extending visual reasoning to partially
observable, interactive environments. AVR necessitates agents to: (1) actively
acquire information via sequential physical actions, (2) integrate observations
across multiple steps for coherent reasoning, and (3) dynamically adjust
decisions based on evolving visual feedback. To rigorously evaluate AVR, we
introduce CLEVR-AVR, a simulation benchmark featuring multi-round interactive
environments designed to assess both reasoning correctness and
information-gathering efficiency. We present AVR-152k, a large-scale dataset
that offers rich Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations detailing iterative
reasoning for uncertainty identification, action-conditioned information gain
prediction, and information-maximizing action selection, crucial for training
agents in a higher-order Markov Decision Process. Building on this, we develop
PhysVLM-AVR, an MLLM achieving state-of-the-art performance on CLEVR-AVR,
embodied reasoning (OpenEQA, RoboVQA), and passive visual reasoning (GeoMath,
Geometry30K). Our analysis also reveals that current embodied MLLMs, despite
detecting information incompleteness, struggle to actively acquire and
integrate new information through interaction, highlighting a fundamental gap
in active reasoning capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种面向城市规模LiDAR的对象中心、不确定性感知变化检测管道，通过多分辨率NDT和点对平面ICP对齐时序数据，利用几何代理和语义约束的双分图分配来处理对象分割与合并，在部分重叠和采样变化下保持稳定性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对垂直偏差、地面坡度和视点不匹配敏感，且缺乏对象身份信息；基于点和体素的神经模型需要大量内存，假设完美预对齐，难以处理薄结构，且很少强制执行类别一致关联，导致分割或合并情况无法解决并忽略不确定性。

Method: 采用多分辨率NDT和点对平面ICP对齐时序LiDAR数据，归一化高度，从配准协方差和表面粗糙度推导每个位置的检测水平；使用几何代理种子跨时期关联，通过语义和实例分割以及类别约束的双分图分配进行细化，处理分割和合并同时保持每类计数；分块处理限制内存而不侵蚀窄地面变化。

Result: 在15个代表性Subiaco区块上，方法达到95.2%准确率、90.4% mF1和82.6% mIoU，超过Triplet KPConv 0.2个百分点准确率、0.2 mF1和0.8 mIoU，在Decreased类别上IoU达到74.8%，提升7.6个百分点。

Conclusion: 提出的对象中心、不确定性感知管道在城市规模LiDAR变化检测中表现出色，特别是在处理对象分割与合并、部分重叠和采样变化方面具有优势，显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: High-definition 3D city maps underpin smart transportation, digital twins,
and autonomous driving, where object level change detection across bi temporal
LiDAR enables HD map maintenance, construction monitoring, and reliable
localization. Classical DSM differencing and image based methods are sensitive
to small vertical bias, ground slope, and viewpoint mismatch and yield cellwise
outputs without object identity. Point based neural models and voxel encodings
demand large memory, assume near perfect pre alignment, degrade thin
structures, and seldom enforce class consistent association, which leaves split
or merge cases unresolved and ignores uncertainty. We propose an object
centric, uncertainty aware pipeline for city scale LiDAR that aligns epochs
with multi resolution NDT followed by point to plane ICP, normalizes height,
and derives a per location level of detection from registration covariance and
surface roughness to calibrate decisions and suppress spurious changes.
Geometry only proxies seed cross epoch associations that are refined by
semantic and instance segmentation and a class constrained bipartite assignment
with augmented dummies to handle splits and merges while preserving per class
counts. Tiled processing bounds memory without eroding narrow ground changes,
and instance level decisions combine 3D overlap, normal direction displacement,
and height and volume differences with a histogram distance, all gated by the
local level of detection to remain stable under partial overlap and sampling
variation. On 15 representative Subiaco blocks the method attains 95.2%
accuracy, 90.4% mF1, and 82.6% mIoU, exceeding Triplet KPConv by 0.2 percentage
points in accuracy, 0.2 in mF1, and 0.8 in mIoU, with the largest gain on
Decreased where IoU reaches 74.8% and improves by 7.6 points.

Method: 构建轻量级动态混合局部先验提取器，通过异构卷积捕获多样局部先验，使用门控网络动态输出专家先验；设计双向交互适配器，采用余弦对齐可变形注意力和通道导向自适应尺度增强进行特征交互与重构。

Result: 在31个最先进方法对比中表现出优越性，在多个二值对象分割任务上展示出色性能。

Conclusion: Controllable-LPMoE方法通过动态先验控制实现了高效微调，在分割任务中表现出卓越性能和广泛适应性。

Abstract: Large-scale foundation models provide powerful feature representations for
downstream object segmentation tasks. However, when adapted to specific tasks
through the full-parameter fine-tuning, the enormous parameters being updated
often results in significant computational overhead, creating a bottleneck in
training efficiency. Although existing methods attempt to fine-tune frozen
models by directly embedding trainable prompts, these prompts lack inherent
semantic priors, limiting the adaptability of large-scale models. In this
paper, we propose a novel dynamic priors-based fine-tuning paradigm with fewer
trainable parameters, dubbed Controllable-LPMoE, which adaptively modulates
frozen foundation models by dynamically controlling local priors to enhance
fine-grained perception for specific segmentation tasks. More specifically, we
construct a lightweight dynamic mixed local priors extractor that captures
diverse local priors from input images through heterogeneous convolutions while
employing a gating network to dynamically output expert priors required for the
subsequent fine-tuning. Furthermore, we design a bi-directional interaction
adapter that employs cosine-aligned deformable attention and channel-oriented
adaptive scale enhancement to interact and restructure between frozen and
trainable features, achieving efficient fine-tuning. Extensive experiments
validate the superiority of our
\href{https://github.com/CSYSI/Controllable-LPMoE} {Controllable-LPMoE}
approach, demonstrating excellent segmentation performance compared to 31
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and adaptability to multiple binary object
segmentation tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了SafetyPairs框架，通过生成仅安全相关特征不同的图像对来系统研究图像安全问题，构建了包含3020对图像的新安全基准


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像安全数据集过于粗糙和模糊，只提供宽泛的安全标签而无法隔离驱动安全差异的具体特征，难以系统区分良性图像和问题图像

Method: 利用图像编辑模型对图像进行针对性修改，仅改变与安全策略相关的特征，从而翻转安全标签，同时保持安全无关细节不变

Result: 构建了包含3020对SafetyPair图像的新安全基准，涵盖9个安全类别，发现视觉语言模型在区分细微差异图像方面存在弱点，该管道还能有效提升轻量级防护模型的训练样本效率

Conclusion: SafetyPairs提供了首个系统研究细粒度图像安全区别的资源，既能评估模型弱点，又能作为数据增强策略提升模型性能

Abstract: What exactly makes a particular image unsafe? Systematically differentiating
between benign and problematic images is a challenging problem, as subtle
changes to an image, such as an insulting gesture or symbol, can drastically
alter its safety implications. However, existing image safety datasets are
coarse and ambiguous, offering only broad safety labels without isolating the
specific features that drive these differences. We introduce SafetyPairs, a
scalable framework for generating counterfactual pairs of images, that differ
only in the features relevant to the given safety policy, thus flipping their
safety label. By leveraging image editing models, we make targeted changes to
images that alter their safety labels while leaving safety-irrelevant details
unchanged. Using SafetyPairs, we construct a new safety benchmark, which serves
as a powerful source of evaluation data that highlights weaknesses in
vision-language models' abilities to distinguish between subtly different
images. Beyond evaluation, we find our pipeline serves as an effective data
augmentation strategy that improves the sample efficiency of training
lightweight guard models. We release a benchmark containing over 3,020
SafetyPair images spanning a diverse taxonomy of 9 safety categories, providing
the first systematic resource for studying fine-grained image safety
distinctions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习框架在提升通用CoT推理能力时难以泛化到训练分布之外

Method: 1) 噪声注入探索策略：在视觉输入中添加高斯噪声鼓励更广泛探索；2) 贝叶斯优势估计：将优势估计建模为贝叶斯推断问题，融合噪声水平和轨迹奖励

Result: 在标准CoT质量、通用能力和幻觉基准测试中显著提升泛化性和鲁棒性，特别是在小规模MLLMs上效果明显

Conclusion: NoisyGRPO通过系统性多模态RL框架有效解决了MLLMs在CoT推理中的泛化问题

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in enhancing the general
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). However, when applied to improve general CoT reasoning,
existing RL frameworks often struggle to generalize beyond the training
distribution. To address this, we propose NoisyGRPO, a systematic multimodal RL
framework that introduces controllable noise into visual inputs for enhanced
exploration and explicitly models the advantage estimation process via a
Bayesian framework. Specifically, NoisyGRPO improves RL training by: (1)
\textbf{Noise-Injected Exploration Policy}: Perturbing visual inputs with
Gaussian noise to encourage exploration across a wider range of visual
scenarios; and (2) \textbf{Bayesian Advantage Estimation}: Formulating
advantage estimation as a principled Bayesian inference problem, where the
injected noise level serves as a prior and the observed trajectory reward as
the likelihood. This Bayesian modeling fuses both sources of information to
compute a robust posterior estimate of trajectory advantage, effectively
guiding MLLMs to prefer visually grounded trajectories over noisy ones.
Experiments on standard CoT quality, general capability, and hallucination
benchmarks demonstrate that NoisyGRPO substantially improves generalization and
robustness, especially in RL settings with small-scale MLLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL
3B. The project page is available at

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于CycleGAN的级联合成器方法，从非对比CT扫描生成数字对比CTPA，以规避碘对比剂的风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CTPA是诊断肺血管疾病的金标准，但依赖碘对比剂存在肾毒性和过敏反应风险，特别是在高危患者中。

Method: 使用基于CycleGAN的级联合成器从NCCT生成DCCTPA，在410对CTPA和NCCT扫描上进行训练和验证。

Result: 该方法在定量指标和定性可视化方面均优于现有方法，在下游任务（肺血管分割和血管量化）中表现显著改善。

Conclusion: DCCTPA能有效增强血管结构，特别是小血管，为规避对比剂风险提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) is the reference standard
for diagnosing pulmonary vascular diseases such as Pulmonary Embolism (PE) and
Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH). However, its reliance on
iodinated contrast agents poses risks including nephrotoxicity and allergic
reactions, particularly in high-risk patients. This study proposes a method to
generate Digital Contrast CTPA (DCCTPA) from Non-Contrast CT (NCCT) scans using
a cascaded synthesizer based on Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial
Networks (CycleGAN). Totally retrospective 410 paired CTPA and NCCT scans were
obtained from three centers. The model was trained and validated internally on
249 paired images. Extra dataset that comprising 161 paired images was as test
set for model generalization evaluation and downstream clinical tasks
validation. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, the proposed method
achieved the best comprehensive performance by evaluating quantitative metrics
(For validation, MAE: 156.28, PSNR: 20.71 and SSIM: 0.98; For test, MAE:
165.12, PSNR: 20.27 and SSIM: 0.98) and qualitative visualization,
demonstrating valid vessel enhancement, superior image fidelity and structural
preservation. The approach was further applied to downstream tasks of pulmonary
vessel segmentation and vascular quantification. On the test set, the average
Dice, clDice, and clRecall of artery and vein pulmonary segmentation was 0.70,
0.71, 0.73 and 0.70, 0.72, 0.75 respectively, all markedly improved compared
with NCCT inputs.\@ Inter-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC) for vessel volume
between DCCTPA and CTPA was significantly better than that between NCCT and
CTPA (Average ICC : 0.81 vs 0.70), indicating effective vascular enhancement in
DCCTPA, especially for small vessels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基础模型中空间智能的集成和验证存在挑战，现有方法使用纯文本提示和VQA式评分，这掩盖了几何信息、引入了语言捷径，并削弱了对真正空间技能的归因。

Method: 引入Spatial Intelligence Grid (SIG)：一种结构化的、基于网格的模式，明确编码物体布局、物体间关系和物理基础先验。作为文本的补充通道，SIG为基础模型推理提供了忠实、组合式的场景结构表示。

Result: 在少样本上下文学习中，SIG相比仅使用VQA表示，在所有VSI指标上都产生了更一致、更稳定和更全面的增益。GPT和Gemini系列模型在SIG指导下表现出更好的空间智能能力。

Conclusion: SIG作为数据标注和训练模式，在学习和评估视觉空间智能方面具有前景，并发布了包含1.4K驾驶帧的SIGBench基准测试，支持基于网格的机器VSI任务和注意力驱动的人类式VSI任务。

Abstract: How to integrate and verify spatial intelligence in foundation models remains
an open challenge. Current practice often proxies Visual-Spatial Intelligence
(VSI) with purely textual prompts and VQA-style scoring, which obscures
geometry, invites linguistic shortcuts, and weakens attribution to genuinely
spatial skills. We introduce Spatial Intelligence Grid (SIG): a structured,
grid-based schema that explicitly encodes object layouts, inter-object
relations, and physically grounded priors. As a complementary channel to text,
SIG provides a faithful, compositional representation of scene structure for
foundation-model reasoning. Building on SIG, we derive SIG-informed evaluation
metrics that quantify a model's intrinsic VSI, which separates spatial
capability from language priors. In few-shot in-context learning with
state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs (e.g. GPT- and Gemini-family models), SIG
yields consistently larger, more stable, and more comprehensive gains across
all VSI metrics compared to VQA-only representations, indicating its promise as
a data-labeling and training schema for learning VSI. We also release SIGBench,
a benchmark of 1.4K driving frames annotated with ground-truth SIG labels and
human gaze traces, supporting both grid-based machine VSI tasks and
attention-driven, human-like VSI tasks in autonomous-driving scenarios.

Abstract: Interactive world models that simulate object dynamics are crucial for
robotics, VR, and AR. However, it remains a significant challenge to learn
physics-consistent dynamics models from limited real-world video data,
especially for deformable objects with spatially-varying physical properties.
To overcome the challenge of data scarcity, we propose PhysWorld, a novel
framework that utilizes a simulator to synthesize physically plausible and
diverse demonstrations to learn efficient world models. Specifically, we first
construct a physics-consistent digital twin within MPM simulator via
constitutive model selection and global-to-local optimization of physical
properties. Subsequently, we apply part-aware perturbations to the physical
properties and generate various motion patterns for the digital twin,
synthesizing extensive and diverse demonstrations. Finally, using these
demonstrations, we train a lightweight GNN-based world model that is embedded
with physical properties. The real video can be used to further refine the
physical properties. PhysWorld achieves accurate and fast future predictions
for various deformable objects, and also generalizes well to novel
interactions. Experiments show that PhysWorld has competitive performance while
enabling inference speeds 47 times faster than the recent state-of-the-art
method, i.e., PhysTwin.

Motivation: 传统Flow Matching模型使用单一大型网络学习从噪声到数据的整个生成轨迹，难以同时捕捉不同时间步的独特信号特征，且推理成本高昂。

Method: 采用分块设计，将生成轨迹划分为多个时间片段，每个片段由专门化的速度块建模；引入语义特征引导模块，使速度块基于预训练表示的语义丰富特征进行条件生成；提出轻量级特征残差近似策略。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256上的实验表明，BFM在可比生成性能下实现了2.1倍到4.9倍的推理复杂度加速，建立了明显优于现有Flow Matching方法的帕累托前沿。

Conclusion: BFM框架通过分块专业化设计和语义特征引导，显著提高了Flow Matching模型的推理效率和生成质量。

Abstract: Recently, Flow Matching models have pushed the boundaries of high-fidelity
data generation across a wide range of domains. It typically employs a single
large network to learn the entire generative trajectory from noise to data.
Despite their effectiveness, this design struggles to capture distinct signal
characteristics across timesteps simultaneously and incurs substantial
inference costs due to the iterative evaluation of the entire model. To address
these limitations, we propose Blockwise Flow Matching (BFM), a novel framework
that partitions the generative trajectory into multiple temporal segments, each
modeled by smaller but specialized velocity blocks. This blockwise design
enables each block to specialize effectively in its designated interval,
improving inference efficiency and sample quality. To further enhance
generation fidelity, we introduce a Semantic Feature Guidance module that
explicitly conditions velocity blocks on semantically rich features aligned
with pretrained representations. Additionally, we propose a lightweight Feature
Residual Approximation strategy that preserves semantic quality while
significantly reducing inference cost. Extensive experiments on ImageNet
256x256 demonstrate that BFM establishes a substantially improved Pareto
frontier over existing Flow Matching methods, achieving 2.1x to 4.9x
accelerations in inference complexity at comparable generation performance.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖单一文本空间来对齐不同物体和领域的视觉语义，这种无差别的对齐方式阻碍了模型准确捕捉多样化的异常语义。

Method: 提出TokenCLIP框架，将标记无关的文本空间扩展为一组正交子空间，通过最优传输问题动态分配每个视觉标记到语义相关的子空间组合，并使用top-k掩码稀疏化传输计划。

Result: 大量实验证明了TokenCLIP的优越性能。

Conclusion: TokenCLIP通过动态标记级对齐机制，有效提升了零样本异常检测的性能，能够更准确地捕捉多样化的异常语义。

Abstract: Adapting CLIP for anomaly detection on unseen objects has shown strong
potential in a zero-shot manner. However, existing methods typically rely on a
single textual space to align with visual semantics across diverse objects and
domains. The indiscriminate alignment hinders the model from accurately
capturing varied anomaly semantics. We propose TokenCLIP, a token-wise
adaptation framework that enables dynamic alignment between visual and
learnable textual spaces for fine-grained anomaly learning. Rather than mapping
all visual tokens to a single, token-agnostic textual space, TokenCLIP aligns
each token with a customized textual subspace that represents its visual
characteristics. Explicitly assigning a unique learnable textual space to each
token is computationally intractable and prone to insufficient optimization. We
instead expand the token-agnostic textual space into a set of orthogonal
subspaces, and then dynamically assign each token to a subspace combination
guided by semantic affinity, which jointly supports customized and efficient
token-wise adaptation. To this end, we formulate dynamic alignment as an
optimal transport problem, where all visual tokens in an image are transported
to textual subspaces based on semantic similarity. The transport constraints of
OT ensure sufficient optimization across subspaces and encourage them to focus
on different semantics. Solving the problem yields a transport plan that
adaptively assigns each token to semantically relevant subspaces. A top-k
masking is then applied to sparsify the plan and specialize subspaces for
distinct visual regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
TokenCLIP.

TL;DR: 提出MATrack系统解决夜间无人机跟踪问题，通过多尺度自适应方法在低光条件下实现稳定跟踪，在UAVDark135基准上性能显著优于现有方法，同时保持81 FPS的实时处理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 夜间无人机跟踪面临低光照、复杂背景和频繁视角变化等挑战，现有基于低光增强和域适应的方法存在视觉伪影、计算成本高和无法充分利用动态物体信息等问题。

Method: MATrack系统包含三个核心模块：多尺度层次融合增强静态和动态模板间的特征一致性，自适应关键令牌门准确识别复杂背景中的物体信息，夜间模板校准器确保长序列中的稳定跟踪性能。

Result: 在UAVDark135基准测试中，精确度、归一化精确度和AUC分别比最先进方法提升5.9%、5.4%和4.2%，处理速度达81 FPS。真实无人机平台测试验证了系统的可靠性。

Conclusion: MATrack能够为夜间搜救、边境巡逻等关键机器人应用提供稳定有效的夜间无人机跟踪支持，解决了现有方法在真实无人机系统中的主要技术挑战。

Abstract: Nighttime UAV tracking faces significant challenges in real-world robotics
operations. Low-light conditions not only limit visual perception capabilities,
but cluttered backgrounds and frequent viewpoint changes also cause existing
trackers to drift or fail during deployment. To address these difficulties,
researchers have proposed solutions based on low-light enhancement and domain
adaptation. However, these methods still have notable shortcomings in actual
UAV systems: low-light enhancement often introduces visual artifacts, domain
adaptation methods are computationally expensive and existing lightweight
designs struggle to fully leverage dynamic object information. Based on an
in-depth analysis of these key issues, we propose MATrack-a multiscale adaptive
system designed specifically for nighttime UAV tracking. MATrack tackles the
main technical challenges of nighttime tracking through the collaborative work
of three core modules: Multiscale Hierarchy Blende (MHB) enhances feature
consistency between static and dynamic templates. Adaptive Key Token Gate
accurately identifies object information within complex backgrounds. Nighttime
Template Calibrator (NTC) ensures stable tracking performance over long
sequences. Extensive experiments show that MATrack achieves a significant
performance improvement. On the UAVDark135 benchmark, its precision, normalized
precision and AUC surpass state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by 5.9%, 5.4% and
4.2% respectively, while maintaining a real-time processing speed of 81 FPS.
Further tests on a real-world UAV platform validate the system's reliability,
demonstrating that MATrack can provide stable and effective nighttime UAV
tracking support for critical robotics applications such as nighttime search
and rescue and border patrol.

Motivation: 现有静态基准存在数据污染和饱和风险，导致性能评估失真，需要更可靠的评估协议。

Method: 使用图表示VQA样本，通过知识增强基准演化(KBE)框架，重构问题并扩展外部知识，实现难度可控的评估。

Result: 实验表明KBE缓解了数据污染和饱和风险，提供了更全面的MLLM能力评估。

Conclusion: KBE框架为多模态大语言模型提供了更可靠、动态的评估方法。

Abstract: The rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) calls for more
reliable evaluation protocols. Existing static benchmarks suffer from the
potential risk of data contamination and saturation, leading to inflated or
misleading performance evaluations. To address these issues, we first apply
Graph formulation to represent a static or dynamic VQA sample. With the
formulation, we propose Knowledge-enhanced Benchmark Evolution(KBE), a dynamic
multimodal evaluation framework. KBE first analyzes the original static
benchmark, then expands it by integrating multimodal knowledge, transforming
the static benchmark into a controllable, dynamic evolving version. Crucially,
KBE can both reconstruct questions by Re-selecting visual information in the
original image and expand existing questions with external textual knowledge.
It enables difficulty-controllable evaluation by adjusting the degree of
question exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KBE alleviates the
risk of data contamination, data saturation, and provides a more comprehensive
assessment of MLLM capabilities.

TL;DR: 本文提出了iSM框架，系统解决了shortcut模型的五个核心问题：复合引导缺陷、固定引导不灵活、频率偏差、自一致性冲突和弯曲流轨迹，显著提升了生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: shortcut模型虽然支持单步、少步和多步采样，但由于性能瓶颈问题阻碍了广泛应用。本文旨在解决这些关键限制，使shortcut模型成为有竞争力的生成模型类别。

Method: 提出iSM统一训练框架，包含四个关键改进：内在引导提供动态控制、多级小波损失缓解频率偏差、缩放最优传输减少训练方差、双EMA策略协调训练稳定性与自一致性。

Result: 在ImageNet 256×256上的实验表明，该方法在单步、少步和多步生成中都显著优于基线shortcut模型，FID指标大幅提升。

Conclusion: iSM框架成功解决了shortcut模型的核心限制，使其成为可行且具有竞争力的生成模型类别。

Abstract: Shortcut models represent a promising, non-adversarial paradigm for
generative modeling, uniquely supporting one-step, few-step, and multi-step
sampling from a single trained network. However, their widespread adoption has
been stymied by critical performance bottlenecks. This paper tackles the five
core issues that held shortcut models back: (1) the hidden flaw of compounding
guidance, which we are the first to formalize, causing severe image artifacts;
(2) inflexible fixed guidance that restricts inference-time control; (3) a
pervasive frequency bias driven by a reliance on low-level distances in the
direct domain, which biases reconstructions toward low frequencies; (4)
divergent self-consistency arising from a conflict with EMA training; and (5)
curvy flow trajectories that impede convergence. To address these challenges,
we introduce iSM, a unified training framework that systematically resolves
each limitation. Our framework is built on four key improvements: Intrinsic
Guidance provides explicit, dynamic control over guidance strength, resolving
both compounding guidance and inflexibility. A Multi-Level Wavelet Loss
mitigates frequency bias to restore high-frequency details. Scaling Optimal
Transport (sOT) reduces training variance and learns straighter, more stable
generative paths. Finally, a Twin EMA strategy reconciles training stability
with self-consistency. Extensive experiments on ImageNet 256 x 256 demonstrate
that our approach yields substantial FID improvements over baseline shortcut
models across one-step, few-step, and multi-step generation, making shortcut
models a viable and competitive class of generative models.

TL;DR: TSSR是一种基于离散扩散模型的新型3D网格生成方法，通过并行生成实现高效高质量的艺术风格3D建模，支持高达10,000个面片和1024^3空间分辨率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实现高精度的token预测并支持并行生成，相比顺序自回归方法具有显著优势，通过同时观察所有网格token来提升效率和可控性。

Method: 采用解耦训练和混合推理策略，将生成过程分为拓扑雕刻和形状细化两个阶段；改进的沙漏架构结合双向注意力和旋转位置编码；引入连接损失作为拓扑约束。

Result: 在复杂数据集上的实验表明，TSSR能够生成高质量的3D艺术风格网格，支持10,000个面片和1024^3的空间分辨率。

Conclusion: TSSR通过并行生成和解耦策略，在3D网格生成中实现了高效性和高质量，为艺术风格3D建模提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Topology Sculptor, Shape Refiner (TSSR), a novel
method for generating high-quality, artist-style 3D meshes based on Discrete
Diffusion Models (DDMs). Our primary motivation for TSSR is to achieve highly
accurate token prediction while enabling parallel generation, a significant
advantage over sequential autoregressive methods. By allowing TSSR to "see" all
mesh tokens concurrently, we unlock a new level of efficiency and control. We
leverage this parallel generation capability through three key innovations: 1)
Decoupled Training and Hybrid Inference, which distinctly separates the
DDM-based generation into a topology sculpting stage and a subsequent shape
refinement stage. This strategic decoupling enables TSSR to effectively capture
both intricate local topology and overarching global shape. 2) An Improved
Hourglass Architecture, featuring bidirectional attention enriched by
face-vertex-sequence level Rotational Positional Embeddings (RoPE), thereby
capturing richer contextual information across the mesh structure. 3) A novel
Connection Loss, which acts as a topological constraint to further enhance the
realism and fidelity of the generated meshes. Extensive experiments on complex
datasets demonstrate that TSSR generates high-quality 3D artist-style meshes,
capable of achieving up to 10,000 faces at a remarkable spatial resolution of
$1024^3$. The code will be released at:

Motivation: 3D高斯溅射虽然具有逼真的实时渲染能力，但缺乏细粒度语义和物理可执行性，限制了其在视觉语言导航中的应用。

Method: 提出SAGE-3D方法，包含两个组件：对象中心语义标注为3DGS添加对象级细粒度注释；物理感知执行连接将碰撞对象嵌入3DGS并构建丰富的物理接口。

Result: 构建了包含1K对象标注3DGS室内场景数据的InteriorGS数据集和首个基于3DGS的VLN基准SAGE-Bench（含2M VLN数据）。实验显示3DGS场景数据收敛更困难但泛化能力强，在VLN-CE Unseen任务上提升基线性能31%。

Conclusion: SAGE-3D成功将3DGS升级为语义和物理对齐的可执行环境，显著提升了视觉语言导航任务的性能，证明了3DGS在缩小仿真与现实差距方面的潜力。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a 3D representation method with photorealistic
real-time rendering capabilities, is regarded as an effective tool for
narrowing the sim-to-real gap. However, it lacks fine-grained semantics and
physical executability for Visual-Language Navigation (VLN). To address this,
we propose SAGE-3D (Semantically and Physically Aligned Gaussian Environments
for 3D Navigation), a new paradigm that upgrades 3DGS into an executable,
semantically and physically aligned environment. It comprises two components:
(1) Object-Centric Semantic Grounding, which adds object-level fine-grained
annotations to 3DGS; and (2) Physics-Aware Execution Jointing, which embeds
collision objects into 3DGS and constructs rich physical interfaces. We release
InteriorGS, containing 1K object-annotated 3DGS indoor scene data, and
introduce SAGE-Bench, the first 3DGS-based VLN benchmark with 2M VLN data.
Experiments show that 3DGS scene data is more difficult to converge, while
exhibiting strong generalizability, improving baseline performance by 31% on
the VLN-CE Unseen task. The data and code will be available soon.

Conclusion: FineRS框架有效解决了多模态大语言模型在高分辨率场景中处理微小目标的挑战，在分割和推理任务上表现出色

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities
across a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, due to the restricted
input resolutions, MLLMs face significant challenges in precisely understanding
and localizing visual details in high-resolution images -- particularly when
dealing with extra-small objects embedded in cluttered contexts. To address
this issue, we propose \textsc{FineRS}, a two-stage MLLM-based reinforcement
learning framework for jointly reasoning and segmenting extremely small objects
within high-resolution scenes. \textsc{FineRS} adopts a coarse-to-fine pipeline
comprising Global Semantic Exploration (GSE) and Localized Perceptual
Refinement (LPR). Specifically, GSE performs instruction-guided reasoning to
generate a textural response and a coarse target region, while LPR refines this
region to produce an accurate bounding box and segmentation mask. To couple the
two stages, we introduce a locate-informed retrospective reward, where LPR's
outputs are used to optimize GSE for more robust coarse region exploration. %
Additionally, we present \textsc{FineRS}-4k, a new dataset for evaluating MLLMs
on attribute-level reasoning and pixel-level segmentation on subtle,
small-scale targets in complex high-resolution scenes. Experimental results on
\textsc{FineRS}-4k and public datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art MLLM-based approaches on both instruction-guided
segmentation and visual reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: VL-SAE通过概念级对齐增强视觉-语言表示，为多模态对齐提供了可解释性，并能提升下游任务性能。

Abstract: The alignment of vision-language representations endows current
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with strong multi-modal reasoning capabilities.
However, the interpretability of the alignment component remains uninvestigated
due to the difficulty in mapping the semantics of multi-modal representations
into a unified concept set. To address this problem, we propose VL-SAE, a
sparse autoencoder that encodes vision-language representations into its hidden
activations. Each neuron in its hidden layer correlates to a concept
represented by semantically similar images and texts, thereby interpreting
these representations with a unified concept set. To establish the
neuron-concept correlation, we encourage semantically similar representations
to exhibit consistent neuron activations during self-supervised training.
First, to measure the semantic similarity of multi-modal representations, we
perform their alignment in an explicit form based on cosine similarity. Second,
we construct the VL-SAE with a distance-based encoder and two modality-specific
decoders to ensure the activation consistency of semantically similar
representations. Experiments across multiple VLMs (e.g., CLIP, LLaVA)
demonstrate the superior capability of VL-SAE in interpreting and enhancing the
vision-language alignment. For interpretation, the alignment between vision and
language representations can be understood by comparing their semantics with
concepts. For enhancement, the alignment can be strengthened by aligning
vision-language representations at the concept level, contributing to
performance improvements in downstream tasks, including zero-shot image
classification and hallucination elimination. Codes are available at

Conclusion: FORM和MorphoEval通过高分辨率预测模拟，将形态、扰动和功能联系起来，推动3D虚拟细胞的实现。

Abstract: Understanding how cells respond to external stimuli is a central challenge in
biomedical research and drug development. Current computational frameworks for
modelling cellular responses remain restricted to two-dimensional
representations, limiting their capacity to capture the complexity of cell
morphology under perturbation. This dimensional constraint poses a critical
bottleneck for the development of accurate virtual cell models. Here, we
present FORM, a machine learning framework for predicting perturbation-induced
changes in three-dimensional cellular structure. FORM consists of two
components: a morphology encoder, trained end-to-end via a novel multi-channel
VQGAN to learn compact 3D representations of cell shape, and a diffusion-based
perturbation trajectory module that captures how morphology evolves across
perturbation conditions. Trained on a large-scale dataset of over 65,000
multi-fluorescence 3D cell volumes spanning diverse chemical and genetic
perturbations, FORM supports both unconditional morphology synthesis and
conditional simulation of perturbed cell states. Beyond generation, FORM can
predict downstream signalling activity, simulate combinatorial perturbation
effects, and model morphodynamic transitions between states of unseen
perturbations. To evaluate performance, we introduce MorphoEval, a benchmarking
suite that quantifies perturbation-induced morphological changes in structural,
statistical, and biological dimensions. Together, FORM and MorphoEval work
toward the realisation of the 3D virtual cell by linking morphology,
perturbation, and function through high-resolution predictive simulation.

Conclusion: CT-CLIP在农业病害识别方面表现出强大能力，为农业应用中的自动化病害识别提供了创新实用的解决方案。

Abstract: In complex orchard environments, the phenotypic heterogeneity of different
apple leaf diseases, characterized by significant variation among lesions,
poses a challenge to traditional multi-scale feature fusion methods. These
methods only integrate multi-layer features extracted by convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and fail to adequately account for the relationships between
local and global features. Therefore, this study proposes a multi-branch
recognition framework named CNN-Transformer-CLIP (CT-CLIP). The framework
synergistically employs a CNN to extract local lesion detail features and a
Vision Transformer to capture global structural relationships. An Adaptive
Feature Fusion Module (AFFM) then dynamically fuses these features, achieving
optimal coupling of local and global information and effectively addressing the
diversity in lesion morphology and distribution. Additionally, to mitigate
interference from complex backgrounds and significantly enhance recognition
accuracy under few-shot conditions, this study proposes a multimodal image-text
learning approach. By leveraging pre-trained CLIP weights, it achieves deep
alignment between visual features and disease semantic descriptions.
Experimental results show that CT-CLIP achieves accuracies of 97.38% and 96.12%
on a publicly available apple disease and a self-built dataset, outperforming
several baseline methods. The proposed CT-CLIP demonstrates strong capabilities
in recognizing agricultural diseases, significantly enhances identification
accuracy under complex environmental conditions, provides an innovative and
practical solution for automated disease recognition in agricultural
applications.

Abstract: UAV tracking can be widely applied in scenarios such as disaster rescue,
environmental monitoring, and logistics transportation. However, existing UAV
tracking methods predominantly emphasize speed and lack exploration in semantic
awareness, which hinders the search region from extracting accurate
localization information from the template. The limitation results in
suboptimal performance under typical UAV tracking challenges such as camera
motion, fast motion, and low resolution, etc. To address this issue, we propose
a dynamic semantic aware correlation modeling tracking framework. The core of
our framework is a Dynamic Semantic Relevance Generator, which, in combination
with the correlation map from the Transformer, explore semantic relevance. The
approach enhances the search region's ability to extract important information
from the template, improving accuracy and robustness under the aforementioned
challenges. Additionally, to enhance the tracking speed, we design a pruning
method for the proposed framework. Therefore, we present multiple model
variants that achieve trade-offs between speed and accuracy, enabling flexible
deployment according to the available computational resources. Experimental
results validate the effectiveness of our method, achieving competitive
performance on multiple UAV tracking datasets. The code is available at

Abstract: Eye gaze offers valuable cues about attention, short-term intent, and future

current activity understanding. Unlike prior approaches that rely solely on
visual inputs or use gaze as an auxiliary input signal , our method uses gaze
only during training. We introduce a gaze-regularized attention mechanism that
aligns model focus with human visual gaze. This design is flexible and modular,
allowing it to generalize across multiple VLM architectures that utilize
attention. Experimental results show that our approach improves semantic
prediction scores by up to 11 for future event prediction and around 7 for
current activity understanding, compared to the corresponding baseline models
trained without gaze regularization. These results highlight the value of
gaze-guided training in improving the accuracy and robustness of egocentric
VLMs. Overall, this work establishes a foundation for using human gaze to
enhance the predictive capabilities of VLMs in real-world scenarios like
assistive robots and human-machine collaboration. Code and additional

### [40] [Why Registration Quality Matters: Enhancing sCT Synthesis with IMPACT-Based Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21358)
*Valentin Boussot,Cédric Hémon,Jean-Claude Nunes,Jean-Louis Dillenseger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的合成CT生成管道，使用2.5D U-Net++架构，结合像素级L1损失和基于SAM与TotalSegmentator的感知损失IMPACT-Synth。评估了两种配准策略：Elastix互信息配准和基于分割网络的IMPACT配准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决合成CT生成中配准误差传播问题，开发更稳健和可泛化的模型，减少对评估管道特定配准策略的依赖。

Method: 使用2.5D U-Net++架构，ResNet-34编码器，联合训练各解剖区域并进行区域微调。损失函数结合L1损失和IMPACT-Synth感知损失。采用测试时增强和五折集成。

Result: 在本地测试集上，IMPACT配准比互信息配准获得更准确和解剖一致的配准，合成CT的MAE更低且解剖结构更真实。但在公共验证集上，使用Elastix配准数据的模型得分更高，反映了配准偏差。

Conclusion: 配准误差会传播到监督学习中，影响训练和评估。IMPACT配准通过促进解剖一致的配准来减轻这种偏差，支持开发更稳健的合成CT生成模型。

Abstract: We participated in the SynthRAD2025 challenge (Tasks 1 and 2) with a unified
pipeline for synthetic CT (sCT) generation from MRI and CBCT, implemented using
the KonfAI framework. Our model is a 2.5D U-Net++ with a ResNet-34 encoder,
trained jointly across anatomical regions and fine-tuned per region. The loss
function combined pixel-wise L1 loss with IMPACT-Synth, a perceptual loss
derived from SAM and TotalSegmentator to enhance structural fidelity. Training
was performed using AdamW (initial learning rate = 0.001, halved every 25k
steps) on patch-based, normalized, body-masked inputs (320x320 for MRI, 256x256
for CBCT), with random flipping as the only augmentation. No post-processing
was applied. Final predictions leveraged test-time augmentation and five-fold
ensembling. The best model was selected based on validation MAE. Two
registration strategies were evaluated: (i) Elastix with mutual information,
consistent with the challenge pipeline, and (ii) IMPACT, a feature-based
similarity metric leveraging pretrained segmentation networks. On the local
test sets, IMPACT-based registration achieved more accurate and anatomically
consistent alignments than mutual-information-based registration, resulting in
improved sCT synthesis with lower MAE and more realistic anatomical structures.
On the public validation set, however, models trained with Elastix-aligned data
achieved higher scores, reflecting a registration bias favoring alignment
strategies consistent with the evaluation pipeline. This highlights how
registration errors can propagate into supervised learning, influencing both
training and evaluation, and potentially inflating performance metrics at the
expense of anatomical fidelity. By promoting anatomically consistent alignment,
IMPACT helps mitigate this bias and supports the development of more robust and
generalizable sCT synthesis models.

*Xi Zhang,Hanwei Zhu,Yan Zhong,Jiamang Wang,Weisi Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于实时网络带宽约束的自适应扩散模型框架，能够根据可用带宽调整生成质量，避免不必要的计算浪费。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型使用固定步数进行去噪，不考虑下游传输限制，导致在带宽受限场景下需要重度压缩，损失细节并浪费计算资源。

Method: 采用端到端联合训练策略，通过轻量级质量嵌入引导去噪过程，使模型能够根据目标质量水平自适应调制去噪过程，实现早期停止采样。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法相比简单的早期停止策略，显著提高了带宽适应生成图像的视觉保真度。

Conclusion: 该方法为带宽受限环境下的高效图像传输提供了有前景的解决方案，且仅需最小的架构改动。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework to enable diffusion models to
adapt their generation quality based on real-time network bandwidth
constraints. Traditional diffusion models produce high-fidelity images by
performing a fixed number of denoising steps, regardless of downstream
transmission limitations. However, in practical cloud-to-device scenarios,
limited bandwidth often necessitates heavy compression, leading to loss of fine
textures and wasted computation. To address this, we introduce a joint
end-to-end training strategy where the diffusion model is conditioned on a
target quality level derived from the available bandwidth. During training, the
model learns to adaptively modulate the denoising process, enabling early-stop
sampling that maintains perceptual quality appropriate to the target
transmission condition. Our method requires minimal architectural changes and
leverages a lightweight quality embedding to guide the denoising trajectory.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the
visual fidelity of bandwidth-adapted generations compared to naive
early-stopping, offering a promising solution for efficient image delivery in
bandwidth-constrained environments. Code is available at:

Conclusion: TerraGen是一个有效的遥感图像生成框架，能够作为通用数据增强生成器，提升各种视觉任务的性能。

Abstract: Remote sensing vision tasks require extensive labeled data across multiple,
interconnected domains. However, current generative data augmentation
frameworks are task-isolated, i.e., each vision task requires training an
independent generative model, and ignores the modeling of geographical
information and spatial constraints. To address these issues, we propose
\textbf{TerraGen}, a unified layout-to-image generation framework that enables
flexible, spatially controllable synthesis of remote sensing imagery for
various high-level vision tasks, e.g., detection, segmentation, and extraction.
Specifically, TerraGen introduces a geographic-spatial layout encoder that
unifies bounding box and segmentation mask inputs, combined with a multi-scale
injection scheme and mask-weighted loss to explicitly encode spatial
constraints, from global structures to fine details. Also, we construct the
first large-scale multi-task remote sensing layout generation dataset
containing 45k images and establish a standardized evaluation protocol for this
task. Experimental results show that our TerraGen can achieve the best
generation image quality across diverse tasks. Additionally, TerraGen can be
used as a universal data-augmentation generator, enhancing downstream task
performance significantly and demonstrating robust cross-task generalisation in
both full-data and few-shot scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出一种深度一致性约束的无缝图像拼接方法，通过多阶段机制和全局深度正则化约束解决视差引起的对齐问题，使用基于图的最优缝合线计算和软缝合区域扩散实现自然无缝的拼接效果。

Motivation: 图像拼接中物体深度的显著变化常导致大视差，从而在拼接结果中产生重影和错位问题，需要解决多视角对齐困难。

Method: 1. 多阶段机制结合全局深度正则化约束增强不同深度范围目标的配准精度；2. 基于图的低成本计算确定最优缝合线，通过软缝合区域扩散精确定位过渡区域；3. 采用重参数化策略优化结构设计提高算法效率。

Conclusion: 该方法通过深度一致性约束和多阶段对齐机制，成功解决了视差引起的图像拼接问题，在保持最优性能的同时显著提高了算法效率。

Abstract: Image stitching synthesizes images captured from multiple perspectives into a
single image with a broader field of view. The significant variations in object
depth often lead to large parallax, resulting in ghosting and misalignment in
the stitched results. To address this, we propose a
depth-consistency-constrained seamless-free image stitching method. First, to
tackle the multi-view alignment difficulties caused by parallax, a multi-stage
mechanism combined with global depth regularization constraints is developed to
enhance the alignment accuracy of the same apparent target across different
depth ranges. Second, during the multi-view image fusion process, an optimal
stitching seam is determined through graph-based low-cost computation, and a
soft-seam region is diffused to precisely locate transition areas, thereby
effectively mitigating alignment errors induced by parallax and achieving
natural and seamless stitching results. Furthermore, considering the
computational overhead in the shift regression process, a reparameterization
strategy is incorporated to optimize the structural design, significantly
improving algorithm efficiency while maintaining optimal performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method against
the existing methods. Code is available at https://github.com/DLUT-YRH/DSFN.

Method: 构建了基于核心视频内容的多层次视觉对应关系（复制、事件、场景、实例、动作等六个层次），开发了三个版本的MUVR基准（Base、Filter、QA），并提出了重排序评分机制。

Result: 对3个最先进的视频检索模型、6个基于图像的视觉语言模型和10个多模态大语言模型进行了广泛评估，揭示了这些方法在处理未修剪视频和多模态查询时的局限性。

Conclusion: MUVR基准揭示了检索方法在处理未修剪视频和多模态查询方面的不足，以及多模态大语言模型在多视频理解和重排序方面的局限，为未来研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: We propose the Multi-modal Untrimmed Video Retrieval task, along with a new
benchmark (MUVR) to advance video retrieval for long-video platforms. MUVR aims
to retrieve untrimmed videos containing relevant segments using multi-modal
queries. It has the following features: 1) Practical retrieval paradigm: MUVR
supports video-centric multi-modal queries, expressing fine-grained retrieval
needs through long text descriptions, video tag prompts, and mask prompts. It
adopts a one-to-many retrieval paradigm and focuses on untrimmed videos,
tailored for long-video platform applications. 2) Multi-level visual
correspondence: To cover common video categories (e.g., news, travel, dance)
and precisely define retrieval matching criteria, we construct multi-level
visual correspondence based on core video content (e.g., news events, travel
locations, dance moves) which users are interested in and want to retrieve. It
covers six levels: copy, event, scene, instance, action, and others. 3)
Comprehensive evaluation criteria: We develop 3 versions of MUVR (i.e., Base,
Filter, QA). MUVR-Base/Filter evaluates retrieval models, while MUVR-QA
assesses MLLMs in a question-answering format. We also propose a Reranking
Score to evaluate the reranking ability of MLLMs. MUVR consists of 53K
untrimmed videos from the video platform Bilibili, with 1,050 multi-modal
queries and 84K matches. Extensive evaluations of 3 state-of-the-art video
retrieval models, 6 image-based VLMs, and 10 MLLMs are conducted. MUVR reveals
the limitations of retrieval methods in processing untrimmed videos and
multi-modal queries, as well as MLLMs in multi-video understanding and
reranking. Our code and benchmark is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种可扩展的视觉概念学习框架，能够自适应识别图像相关概念轴并在真实场景中沿这些轴进行视觉概念定位，无需预定义概念轴。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言引导的视觉概念学习方法局限于少数预定义的基本轴（如颜色、形状），且通常在合成数据集中探索，无法适应真实世界中丰富多样的语义维度。

Method: 利用预训练视觉语言模型和通用提示策略识别多样化的图像相关轴，通过通用概念编码器自适应绑定视觉特征到发现的轴，无需为每个概念引入额外参数，通过组合锚定目标确保各轴可独立操作。

Result: 在ImageNet、CelebA-HQ和AFHQ数据集上展示了卓越的编辑能力，能够处理过于多样化而无法手动预定义的真实世界概念，并表现出强大的组合泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法在视觉概念学习和基于文本的编辑方法中表现优异，为真实场景中的语言引导视觉概念学习提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Human intelligence effortlessly interprets visual scenes along a rich
spectrum of semantic dimensions. However, existing approaches to
language-grounded visual concept learning are limited to a few predefined
primitive axes, such as color and shape, and are typically explored in
synthetic datasets. In this work, we propose a scalable framework that
adaptively identifies image-related concept axes and grounds visual concepts
along these axes in real-world scenes. Leveraging a pretrained vision-language
model and our universal prompting strategy, our framework identifies a diverse
image-related axes without any prior knowledge. Our universal concept encoder
adaptively binds visual features to the discovered axes without introducing
additional model parameters for each concept. To ground visual concepts along
the discovered axes, we optimize a compositional anchoring objective, which
ensures that each axis can be independently manipulated without affecting
others. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on subsets of
ImageNet, CelebA-HQ, and AFHQ, showcasing superior editing capabilities across
diverse real-world concepts that are too varied to be manually predefined. Our
method also exhibits strong compositional generalization, outperforming
existing visual concept learning and text-based editing methods. The code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种各向异性池化策略来改进基于查找表的图像恢复CNN方法，通过广义中值池化和学习数据依赖的池化系数，替代传统的平均池化，显著提升了恢复质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于查找表的CNN图像恢复方法使用平均池化融合不同方向的像素块结果，但这种方法不适用于各向异性信号结构，导致性能受限。

Method: 引入广义中值池化方法，并进一步扩展为学习数据依赖的池化系数，使不同方向的像素块贡献能够自适应加权。

Result: 在各种恢复基准测试中，所提出的各向异性池化策略在感知质量和数值指标上都优于现有的LUT可实现的CNN方法。

Conclusion: 各向异性池化策略有效解决了传统平均池化在各向异性信号结构中的不足，显著提升了基于查找表的图像恢复方法的性能。

Abstract: Table look-up realization of image restoration CNNs has the potential of
achieving competitive image quality while being much faster and resource frugal
than the straightforward CNN implementation. The main technical challenge
facing the LUT-based CNN algorithm designers is to manage the table size
without overly restricting the receptive field. The prevailing strategy is to
reuse the table for small pixel patches of different orientations (apparently
assuming a degree of isotropy) and then fuse the look-up results. The fusion is
currently done by average pooling, which we find being ill suited to
anisotropic signal structures. To alleviate the problem, we investigate and
discuss anisotropic pooling methods to replace naive averaging for improving
the performance of the current LUT-realizable CNN restoration methods. First,
we introduce the method of generalized median pooling which leads to measurable
gains over average pooling. We then extend this idea by learning data-dependent
pooling coefficients for each orientation, so that they can adaptively weigh
the contributions of differently oriented pixel patches. Experimental results
on various restoration benchmarks show that our anisotropic pooling strategy
yields both perceptually and numerically superior results compared to existing
LUT-realizable CNN methods.

TL;DR: OpenHype提出了一种使用双曲潜在空间表示3D场景层次结构的新方法，解决了现有方法在推理效率和泛化能力方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的显式建模层次结构的方法存在显著局限性：要么需要多次渲染来捕获不同粒度的嵌入，显著增加推理时间；要么依赖预定义的封闭离散层次结构，对现实世界中多样化结构的泛化能力差。

Method: 使用连续双曲潜在空间表示场景层次结构，利用双曲几何的特性自然编码多尺度关系，并通过潜在空间中的测地线路径实现层次结构的平滑遍历。

Result: 在标准基准测试中优于最先进的方法，在3D场景理解方面展现出卓越的效率和适应性。

Conclusion: OpenHype通过双曲几何表示有效解决了3D场景层次建模的挑战，为自主代理提供更全面的环境理解能力。

Abstract: Modeling the inherent hierarchical structure of 3D objects and 3D scenes is
highly desirable, as it enables a more holistic understanding of environments
for autonomous agents. Accomplishing this with implicit representations, such
as Neural Radiance Fields, remains an unexplored challenge. Existing methods
that explicitly model hierarchical structures often face significant
limitations: they either require multiple rendering passes to capture
embeddings at different levels of granularity, significantly increasing
inference time, or rely on predefined, closed-set discrete hierarchies that
generalize poorly to the diverse and nuanced structures encountered by agents
in the real world. To address these challenges, we propose OpenHype, a novel
approach that represents scene hierarchies using a continuous hyperbolic latent
space. By leveraging the properties of hyperbolic geometry, OpenHype naturally
encodes multi-scale relationships and enables smooth traversal of hierarchies
through geodesic paths in latent space. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches on standard benchmarks, demonstrating superior efficiency and
adaptability in 3D scene understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频异常检测研究主要关注离线场景，而在线实时检测由于计算强度大和实时性要求很少受到关注。本文旨在解决在线视频异常检测的复杂性问题。

Method: 使用预训练的大规模视觉语言模型处理流式输入，结合受LSTM启发的预测机制来捕获时间依赖性，并设计了评分队列和异常先验来动态存储最近分数和覆盖所有异常。

Result: 在UCF-Crime和XD-Violence两个大型数据集上的实验表明，MoniTor优于现有最先进方法，且与弱监督方法相比具有竞争力，且无需训练。

Conclusion: MoniTor为在线视频异常检测提供了一种有效的无训练解决方案，通过结合预训练模型和记忆机制，在保持实时性的同时实现了优异的检测性能。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to locate unusual activities or behaviors
within videos. Recently, offline VAD has garnered substantial research
attention, which has been invigorated by the progress in large language models
(LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), offering the potential for a more
nuanced understanding of anomalies. However, online VAD has seldom received
attention due to real-time constraints and computational intensity. In this
paper, we introduce a novel Memory-based online scoring queue scheme for
Training-free VAD (MoniTor), to address the inherent complexities in online
VAD. Specifically, MoniTor applies a streaming input to VLMs, leveraging the
capabilities of pre-trained large-scale models. To capture temporal
dependencies more effectively, we incorporate a novel prediction mechanism
inspired by Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This ensures the model can
effectively model past states and leverage previous predictions to identify
anomalous behaviors. Thereby, it better understands the current frame.
Moreover, we design a scoring queue and an anomaly prior to dynamically store
recent scores and cover all anomalies in the monitoring scenario, providing
guidance for LLMs to distinguish between normal and abnormal behaviors over
time. We evaluate MoniTor on two large datasets (i.e., UCF-Crime and
XD-Violence) containing various surveillance and real-world scenarios. The
results demonstrate that MoniTor outperforms state-of-the-art methods and is
competitive with weakly supervised methods without training. Code is available

Motivation: 现有视频修复方法在严重内容退化情况下表现不佳，且往往忽视时空稳定性，导致对视频后半部分控制不足。

Method: 提出VidSplice框架，包含CoSpliced模块进行首帧传播策略，以及上下文控制器模块编码一致先验并注入I2V生成主干，有效约束生成过程中的内容失真。

Result: 广泛评估表明VidSplice在多种视频修复场景中达到竞争性性能，显著改善前景对齐和运动稳定性，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VidSplice通过解耦策略和间隔帧先验，有效解决了视频修复中的时空一致性问题，为复杂退化情况下的视频修复提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent video inpainting methods often employ image-to-video (I2V) priors to
model temporal consistency across masked frames. While effective in moderate
cases, these methods struggle under severe content degradation and tend to
overlook spatiotemporal stability, resulting in insufficient control over the
latter parts of the video. To address these limitations, we decouple video
inpainting into two sub-tasks: multi-frame consistent image inpainting and
masked area motion propagation. We propose VidSplice, a novel framework that
introduces spaced-frame priors to guide the inpainting process with
spatiotemporal cues. To enhance spatial coherence, we design a CoSpliced Module
to perform first-frame propagation strategy that diffuses the initial frame
content into subsequent reference frames through a splicing mechanism.
Additionally, we introduce a delicate context controller module that encodes
coherent priors after frame duplication and injects the spliced video into the
I2V generative backbone, effectively constraining content distortion during
generation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that VidSplice achieves
competitive performance across diverse video inpainting scenarios. Moreover,
its design significantly improves both foreground alignment and motion
stability, outperforming existing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在胸片诊断中准确性高，但由于其黑盒性质难以获得临床信任。医生需要透明、可验证的解释来信任自动化诊断并识别潜在失败模式。

Method: 在BiomedCLIP诊断分类器上训练基于转码器的稀疏自编码器，将医学图像表示分解为可解释的视觉模式。在MIMIC-CXR数据集上训练100个转码器集成，发现约5,000个单语义模式。

Result: 发现了涵盖心脏、肺部、胸膜、结构、设备和伪影类别的约5,000个单语义模式。每个模式在具有特定放射学特征的图像间表现一致激活行为，预测可分解为20-50个可解释模式。在五个关键发现上达到竞争性诊断准确性。

Conclusion: CXR-LanIC证明医学AI系统可以同时具备准确性和可解释性，通过从针对特定诊断目标训练的分类器中提取可解释特征，确保发现的模式与临床决策直接相关，支持更安全的临床部署。

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved remarkable accuracy in chest X-ray
diagnosis, yet their widespread clinical adoption remains limited by the
black-box nature of their predictions. Clinicians require transparent,
verifiable explanations to trust automated diagnoses and identify potential
failure modes. We introduce CXR-LanIC (Language-Grounded Interpretable
Classifier for Chest X-rays), a novel framework that addresses this
interpretability challenge through task-aligned pattern discovery. Our approach
trains transcoder-based sparse autoencoders on a BiomedCLIP diagnostic
classifier to decompose medical image representations into interpretable visual
patterns. By training an ensemble of 100 transcoders on multimodal embeddings
from the MIMIC-CXR dataset, we discover approximately 5,000 monosemantic
patterns spanning cardiac, pulmonary, pleural, structural, device, and artifact
categories. Each pattern exhibits consistent activation behavior across images
sharing specific radiological features, enabling transparent attribution where
predictions decompose into 20-50 interpretable patterns with verifiable
activation galleries. CXR-LanIC achieves competitive diagnostic accuracy on
five key findings while providing the foundation for natural language
explanations through planned large multimodal model annotation. Our key
innovation lies in extracting interpretable features from a classifier trained
on specific diagnostic objectives rather than general-purpose embeddings,
ensuring discovered patterns are directly relevant to clinical decision-making,
demonstrating that medical AI systems can be both accurate and interpretable,
supporting safer clinical deployment through transparent, clinically grounded
explanations.

Conclusion: 细胞级聚合和组织-细胞交互在细粒度计算病理学中发挥关键作用。

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of histopathological images demands integration of
information across spatial and semantic scales, from nuclear morphology and
cellular textures to global tissue organization and disease-specific patterns.
Although recent foundation models in pathology have shown strong capabilities
in capturing global tissue context, their omission of cell-level feature
modeling remains a key limitation for fine-grained tasks such as cancer subtype
classification. To address this, we propose a dual-stream architecture that
models the interplay between macroscale tissue features and aggregated cellular
representations. To efficiently aggregate information from large cell sets, we
propose a receptance-weighted key-value aggregation model, a recurrent
transformer that captures inter-cell dependencies with linear complexity.
Furthermore, we introduce a bidirectional tissue-cell interaction module to
enable mutual attention between localized cellular cues and their surrounding
tissue environment. Experiments on four histopathological subtype
classification benchmarks show that the proposed method outperforms existing
models, demonstrating the critical role of cell-level aggregation and
tissue-cell interaction in fine-grained computational pathology.

characteristic features. To find the best solution, we deeply investigated all
elements of the MOT process, including feature extraction, tracking, and
community search. Furthermore, GRAP-MOT is equipped with a person's position
estimation module, which gives additional key information to the MOT method,
ensuring better results than methods without position data. We tested GRAP-MOT
on recordings acquired in a closed-area model and on publicly available real
datasets that fulfil the requirement of a highly congested space, showing the
superiority of our proposition. Finally, we analyzed existing metrics used to
compare MOT algorithms and concluded that IDF1 is more adequate than MOTA in
such comparisons. We made our code, along with the acquired dataset, publicly
available.

Abstract: Placental abruption is a severe complication during pregnancy, and its early
accurate diagnosis is crucial for ensuring maternal and fetal safety.
Traditional ultrasound diagnostic methods heavily rely on physician experience,
leading to issues such as subjective bias and diagnostic inconsistencies. This
paper proposes an improved model, EH-YOLOv11n (Enhanced Hemorrhage-YOLOv11n),
based on small-sample learning, aiming to achieve automatic detection of
hematoma features in placental ultrasound images. The model enhances
performance through multidimensional optimization: it integrates wavelet
convolution and coordinate convolution to strengthen frequency and spatial
feature extraction; incorporates a cascaded group attention mechanism to
suppress ultrasound artifacts and occlusion interference, thereby improving
bounding box localization accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate a
detection accuracy of 78%, representing a 2.5% improvement over YOLOv11n and a
13.7% increase over YOLOv8. The model exhibits significant superiority in
precision-recall curves, confidence scores, and occlusion scenarios. Combining
high accuracy with real-time processing, this model provides a reliable
solution for computer-aided diagnosis of placental abruption, holding
significant clinical application value.

TL;DR: 提出了GranViT，一种集成细粒度特征提取与语义对齐的视觉Transformer，通过区域级自回归训练增强多模态大语言模型的细粒度感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉编码器主要关注全局图像表示，但忽视了细粒度区域分析，在细粒度感知方面存在局限，主要由于缺乏细粒度标注数据和专门的预训练范式。

Method: 构建了包含200万张图像和1.8亿个高质量区域级标注的Gran-29M数据集，开发了预训练-适应框架和自蒸馏机制，通过边界框到标题回归和标题到边界框回归来增强视觉表示和定位能力。

Result: GranViT超越了现有视觉编码器，在不同LLMs上展现出强大的可迁移性，在细粒度识别、多模态VQA和OCR理解任务上取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: GranViT通过大规模细粒度预训练和自蒸馏机制，成功提升了视觉编码器的细粒度感知能力，为多模态大语言模型提供了更强大的视觉理解基础。

Abstract: Vision encoders are indispensable for allowing impressive performance of
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in vision language tasks such as
visual question answering and reasoning. However, existing vision encoders
focus on global image representations but overlook fine-grained regional
analysis. They are limited in fine grained perception due to the scarcity of
fine grained annotated data and the lack of a fine grained pre-training
paradigm. In this paper, we propose GranViT, a novel Vision Transformer that
integrates fine-grained feature extraction with semantic alignment to Large
Language Models (LLMs) via region level autoregressive training. We first
construct Gran-29M, a dataset comprising 2million natural and OCR images paired
with over 180 million high-quality region-level annotations, to enable large
scale fine grained pretraining. Consequently, we develop a
pretraining-adaptation framework along with a self distillation mechanism to
train fine-grained GranViT on Gran-29M. We sufficiently exploit the
fine-grained annotations from Gran-29M to resort to bounding-box-to-caption
regression to enhance localized visual representation of the vision encoder in
the pretraining and caption-to-bounding-box regression to improve vision
feature utilization and localization for LLM in the adaptation. We further
incorporate a self distillation mechanism that imposes explicit localization
constraints on the vision encoder to strengthen its regional reasoning
capability. Extensive experiments show that GranViT surpasses existing vision
encoders and attains strong transferability to varying LLMs. Remarkably, it
achieves state-of-the-art results on fine-grained recognition, multimodal VQA,
and OCR understanding.

*Kaibo Wang,Jianda Mao,Tong Wu,Yang Xiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了前瞻性引导(FSG)方法，通过统一视角将条件引导重新定义为不动点迭代，在早期扩散阶段优先解决长间隔子问题，提升图像质量和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CFG方法基于不同的理论解释，限制了设计空间并模糊了关键设计选择，需要统一视角来理解其工作机制。

Method: 将条件引导重新定义为不动点迭代，寻找潜在空间的黄金路径；提出FSG方法，在早期扩散阶段优先解决长间隔子问题并增加迭代次数。

Result: 在多种数据集和模型架构上的实验验证了FSG在图像质量和计算效率方面优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 为条件引导提供了新视角，开启了自适应设计的潜力，证明了FSG方法的优越性。

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is an essential component of text-to-image
diffusion models, and understanding and advancing its operational mechanisms
remains a central focus of research. Existing approaches stem from divergent
theoretical interpretations, thereby limiting the design space and obscuring
key design choices. To address this, we propose a unified perspective that
reframes conditional guidance as fixed point iterations, seeking to identify a
golden path where latents produce consistent outputs under both conditional and
unconditional generation. We demonstrate that CFG and its variants constitute a
special case of single-step short-interval iteration, which is theoretically
proven to exhibit inefficiency. To this end, we introduce Foresight Guidance
(FSG), which prioritizes solving longer-interval subproblems in early diffusion
stages with increased iterations. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets
and model architectures validate the superiority of FSG over state-of-the-art
methods in both image quality and computational efficiency. Our work offers
novel perspectives for conditional guidance and unlocks the potential of
adaptive design.

TL;DR: 提出了Chunk-GRPO方法，通过将优化从步级提升到块级来解决GRPO在文本到图像生成中的优势归因不准确和忽略时间动态的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO在基于流匹配的文本到图像生成中面临两个关键限制：优势归因不准确，以及忽略生成的时间动态特性。

Method: 将连续步骤分组为连贯的'块'以捕捉流匹配的内在时间动态，并在块级别优化策略，同时引入可选的加权采样策略来进一步提升性能。

Result: 大量实验表明，Chunk-GRPO在偏好对齐和图像质量方面都取得了优越的结果。

Conclusion: 块级优化为基于GRPO的方法展现了良好前景。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has shown strong potential for
flow-matching-based text-to-image (T2I) generation, but it faces two key
limitations: inaccurate advantage attribution, and the neglect of temporal
dynamics of generation. In this work, we argue that shifting the optimization
paradigm from the step level to the chunk level can effectively alleviate these
issues. Building on this idea, we propose Chunk-GRPO, the first chunk-level
GRPO-based approach for T2I generation. The insight is to group consecutive
steps into coherent 'chunk's that capture the intrinsic temporal dynamics of
flow matching, and to optimize policies at the chunk level. In addition, we
introduce an optional weighted sampling strategy to further enhance
performance. Extensive experiments show that ChunkGRPO achieves superior
results in both preference alignment and image quality, highlighting the
promise of chunk-level optimization for GRPO-based methods.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于信号处理的方法来分析文本生成模型中注意力头的专业化模式，发现只需编辑1%的注意力头就能可靠地抑制或增强目标概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言和视觉语言模型在多种任务中表现出色，但其内部机制仍不完全清楚。研究旨在理解注意力头如何专门化处理特定语义或视觉属性。

Method: 基于已有的可解释性方法，通过信号处理视角重新解释使用最终解码层探测中间激活的做法，系统分析多个样本并基于与目标概念的相关性对注意力头进行排序。

Result: 在单模态和多模态Transformer中都发现了注意力头级别的专业化一致模式，仅编辑1%的注意力头就能可靠地控制模型输出中的目标概念。

Conclusion: 注意力层中存在可解释和可控的结构，为理解和编辑大规模生成模型提供了简单工具。

Abstract: Language and vision-language models have shown impressive performance across
a wide range of tasks, but their internal mechanisms remain only partly
understood. In this work, we study how individual attention heads in
text-generative models specialize in specific semantic or visual attributes.
Building on an established interpretability method, we reinterpret the practice
of probing intermediate activations with the final decoding layer through the
lens of signal processing. This lets us analyze multiple samples in a
principled way and rank attention heads based on their relevance to target
concepts. Our results show consistent patterns of specialization at the head
level across both unimodal and multimodal transformers. Remarkably, we find
that editing as few as 1% of the heads, selected using our method, can reliably
suppress or enhance targeted concepts in the model output. We validate our
approach on language tasks such as question answering and toxicity mitigation,
as well as vision-language tasks including image classification and captioning.
Our findings highlight an interpretable and controllable structure within
attention layers, offering simple tools for understanding and editing
large-scale generative models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Gompertz-CNN动态知识蒸馏框架，通过Gompertz生长模型调整蒸馏损失权重，结合Wasserstein距离和梯度匹配，在CIFAR数据集上相比传统方法提升准确率8%和4%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏方法无法捕捉学生模型认知能力的动态演变，导致知识转移效果不佳。

Method: 使用Gompertz曲线动态调整蒸馏损失权重，结合Wasserstein距离测量特征差异和梯度匹配对齐反向传播行为，构建多损失目标函数。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上，使用ResNet50和MobileNet_v2等架构，相比传统方法分别获得8%和4%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: Gompertz-CNN通过动态调整蒸馏策略有效提升了知识蒸馏性能，证明了考虑学生模型学习进程的重要性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel dynamic knowledge distillation framework,
Gompertz-CNN, which integrates the Gompertz growth model into the training
process to address the limitations of traditional knowledge distillation.
Conventional methods often fail to capture the evolving cognitive capacity of
student models, leading to suboptimal knowledge transfer. To overcome this, we
propose a stage-aware distillation strategy that dynamically adjusts the weight
of distillation loss based on the Gompertz curve, reflecting the student's
learning progression: slow initial growth, rapid mid-phase improvement, and
late-stage saturation. Our framework incorporates Wasserstein distance to
measure feature-level discrepancies and gradient matching to align backward
propagation behaviors between teacher and student models. These components are
unified under a multi-loss objective, where the Gompertz curve modulates the
influence of distillation losses over time. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10
and CIFAR-100 using various teacher-student architectures (e.g., ResNet50 and
MobileNet_v2) demonstrate that Gompertz-CNN consistently outperforms
traditional distillation methods, achieving up to 8% and 4% accuracy gains on
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, respectively.

TL;DR: Foley Control是一种轻量级视频引导Foley音效生成方法，通过冻结预训练单模态模型，仅学习小型跨注意力桥接器来连接视频和音频模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态系统需要大量可训练参数，且缺乏模块化设计。该方法旨在实现高效视频-音频同步，同时保持提示驱动的可控性和生产友好性。

Method: 将V-JEPA2视频嵌入连接到冻结的Stable Audio Open DiT文本转音频模型，在现有文本跨注意力后插入紧凑的视频跨注意力层，视频token经过池化处理以减少内存需求。

Result: 在精选的视频-音频基准测试中，Foley Control在时间和语义对齐方面表现具有竞争力，可训练参数远少于近期多模态系统，同时保持提示可控性和模块化特性。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效的视频引导Foley音效生成方案，其桥接设计可扩展到其他音频模态（如语音），具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Foley Control is a lightweight approach to video-guided Foley that keeps
pretrained single-modality models frozen and learns only a small
cross-attention bridge between them. We connect V-JEPA2 video embeddings to a
frozen Stable Audio Open DiT text-to-audio (T2A) model by inserting compact
video cross-attention after the model's existing text cross-attention, so
prompts set global semantics while video refines timing and local dynamics. The
frozen backbones retain strong marginals (video; audio given text) and the
bridge learns the audio-video dependency needed for synchronization -- without
retraining the audio prior. To cut memory and stabilize training, we pool video
tokens before conditioning. On curated video-audio benchmarks, Foley Control
delivers competitive temporal and semantic alignment with far fewer trainable
parameters than recent multi-modal systems, while preserving prompt-driven
controllability and production-friendly modularity (swap/upgrade encoders or
the T2A backbone without end-to-end retraining). Although we focus on
Video-to-Foley, the same bridge design can potentially extend to other audio
modalities (e.g., speech).

Motivation: 生态学领域对黑盒神经网络模型缺乏信任，阻碍了计算机视觉在生态研究和保护监测中的应用，需要提供模型预测的证据和识别部署限制。

Method: 使用Glacier Bay国家公园的航拍图像训练Faster R-CNN检测海豹，应用梯度类激活映射（HiResCAM、LayerCAM）、LIME和基于扰动的解释方法生成预测解释。

Result: 解释集中在海豹躯体和轮廓而非周围环境，移除海豹会降低检测置信度，揭示了模型将海豹与黑冰和岩石混淆的系统性错误模式。

Conclusion: 通过将目标检测与后验可解释性结合，可以开发出可审计、支持决策的保护监测工具，超越黑盒预测。

Abstract: Computer vision can accelerate ecological research and conservation
monitoring, yet adoption in ecology lags in part because of a lack of trust in
black-box neural-network-based models. We seek to address this challenge by
applying post-hoc explanations to provide evidence for predictions and document
limitations that are important to field deployment. Using aerial imagery from
Glacier Bay National Park, we train a Faster R-CNN to detect pinnipeds (harbor
seals) and generate explanations via gradient-based class activation mapping
(HiResCAM, LayerCAM), local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME),
and perturbation-based explanations. We assess explanations along three axes
relevant to field use: (i) localization fidelity: whether high-attribution
regions coincide with the animal rather than background context; (ii)
faithfulness: whether deletion/insertion tests produce changes in detector
confidence; and (iii) diagnostic utility: whether explanations reveal
systematic failure modes. Explanations concentrate on seal torsos and contours
rather than surrounding ice/rock, and removal of the seals reduces detection
confidence, providing model-evidence for true positives. The analysis also
uncovers recurrent error sources, including confusion between seals and black
ice and rocks. We translate these findings into actionable next steps for model
development, including more targeted data curation and augmentation. By pairing
object detection with post-hoc explainability, we can move beyond "black-box"
predictions toward auditable, decision-supporting tools for conservation
monitoring.

Motivation: 现有生成式超分辨率方法在自然图像上表现良好，但会扭曲文本，导致图像质量与文本可读性之间的根本性权衡。

Method: 采用两阶段框架，首先重建精确的文本结构，然后使用这些结构指导后续的全图像超分辨率，实现从字形到图像的引导。

Result: 在UltraZoom-ST数据集上的广泛实验表明，TIGER实现了最先进的性能，在保持整体图像质量的同时显著提升了可读性。

Conclusion: TIGER通过解耦字形恢复和图像增强，打破了图像质量与文本可读性之间的权衡，为场景文本超分辨率提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Current generative super-resolution methods show strong performance on
natural images but distort text, creating a fundamental trade-off between image
quality and textual readability. To address this, we introduce \textbf{TIGER}
(\textbf{T}ext-\textbf{I}mage \textbf{G}uided
sup\textbf{E}r-\textbf{R}esolution), a novel two-stage framework that breaks
this trade-off through a \textit{"text-first, image-later"} paradigm.
\textbf{TIGER} explicitly decouples glyph restoration from image enhancement:
it first reconstructs precise text structures and then uses them to guide
subsequent full-image super-resolution. This glyph-to-image guidance ensures
both high fidelity and visual consistency. To support comprehensive training
and evaluation, we also contribute the \textbf{UltraZoom-ST} (UltraZoom-Scene
Text), the first scene text dataset with extreme zoom (\textbf{$\times$14.29}).
Extensive experiments show that \textbf{TIGER} achieves
\textbf{state-of-the-art} performance, enhancing readability while preserving

Motivation: 药物难治性癫痫的术前评估需要定位癫痫灶，MEG中的发作间期尖波是重要生物标志物，但手动检测耗时且易出错，现有自动化方法不适合临床实践。

Method: 提出基于特征的ANN和CNN两种模型架构，在59名患者数据上训练，采用交互式机器学习策略迭代改进数据标注质量，与现有最优模型进行比较。

Result: 两种模型在10名测试患者上均优于现有最优模型（F1分数：CNN=0.46，ANN=0.44），交互式学习策略证明模型对噪声标注具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 简单架构的模型在分析复杂和不完美标注数据时具有鲁棒性，交互式机器学习方法有望加速数据标注，模型为自动检测发作间期尖波提供了有效工具。

Abstract: In drug-resistant epilepsy, presurgical evaluation of epilepsy can be
considered. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) has been shown to be an effective exam
to inform the localization of the epileptogenic zone through the localization
of interictal epileptic spikes. Manual detection of these pathological
biomarkers remains a fastidious and error-prone task due to the high
dimensionality of MEG recordings, and interrater agreement has been reported to
be only moderate. Current automated methods are unsuitable for clinical
practice, either requiring extensively annotated data or lacking robustness on
non-typical data. In this work, we demonstrate that deep learning models can be
used for detecting interictal spikes in MEG recordings, even when only temporal
and single-expert annotations are available, which represents real-world
clinical practice. We propose two model architectures: a feature-based
artificial neural network (ANN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN),
trained on a database of 59 patients, and evaluated against a state-of-the-art
model to classify short time windows of signal. In addition, we employ an
interactive machine learning strategy to iteratively improve our data
annotation quality using intermediary model outputs. Both proposed models
outperform the state-of-the-art model (F1-scores: CNN=0.46, ANN=0.44) when
tested on 10 holdout test patients. The interactive machine learning strategy
demonstrates that our models are robust to noisy annotations. Overall, results
highlight the robustness of models with simple architectures when analyzing
complex and imperfectly annotated data. Our method of interactive machine
learning offers great potential for faster data annotation, while our models
represent useful and efficient tools for automated interictal spikes detection.

Conclusion: 大规模合成数据生成和模糊感知架构能够显著提升显著目标检测任务的泛化能力和性能表现。

Abstract: Salient object detection exemplifies data-bounded tasks where expensive
pixel-precise annotations force separate model training for related subtasks
like DIS and HR-SOD. We present a method that dramatically improves
generalization through large-scale synthetic data generation and
ambiguity-aware architecture. We introduce S3OD, a dataset of over 139,000
high-resolution images created through our multi-modal diffusion pipeline that
extracts labels from diffusion and DINO-v3 features. The iterative generation
framework prioritizes challenging categories based on model performance. We
propose a streamlined multi-mask decoder that naturally handles the inherent
ambiguity in salient object detection by predicting multiple valid
interpretations. Models trained solely on synthetic data achieve 20-50% error
reduction in cross-dataset generalization, while fine-tuned versions reach
state-of-the-art performance across DIS and HR-SOD benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了Modest-Align轻量级跨模态对齐框架，通过随机扰动和嵌入平滑策略解决资源受限场景下模型的过度自信问题，在减少100倍训练数据和600倍GPU时间的情况下达到竞争性性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在资源受限设置中，大规模预训练模型（如CLIP）面对有限或低质量数据时出现的过度自信和性能下降问题，特别是当图像-文本对存在模糊或弱相关性时。

Method: 采用两种互补策略：随机扰动（引入受控噪声模拟不确定性）和嵌入平滑（在嵌入空间校准相似度分布），共同减少过度自信并提升对噪声或弱对齐样本的处理能力。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，Modest-Align在检索任务中优于最先进方法，仅使用CLIP 1/100的训练数据和1/600的GPU时间就达到了竞争性结果。

Conclusion: 该方法为现实世界低资源场景下的跨模态对齐提供了一个实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-modal alignment aims to map heterogeneous modalities into a shared
latent space, as exemplified by models like CLIP, which benefit from
large-scale image-text pretraining for strong recognition capabilities.
However, when operating in resource-constrained settings with limited or
low-quality data, these models often suffer from overconfidence and degraded
performance due to the prevalence of ambiguous or weakly correlated image-text
pairs. Current contrastive learning approaches, which rely on single positive
pairs, further exacerbate this issue by reinforcing overconfidence on uncertain
samples. To address these challenges, we propose Modest-Align, a lightweight
alignment framework designed for robustness and efficiency. Our approach
leverages two complementary strategies -- Random Perturbation, which introduces
controlled noise to simulate uncertainty, and Embedding Smoothing, which
calibrates similarity distributions in the embedding space. These mechanisms
collectively reduce overconfidence and improve performance on noisy or weakly
aligned samples. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that Modest-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in retrieval
tasks, achieving competitive results with over 100x less training data and 600x
less GPU time than CLIP. Our method offers a practical and scalable solution
for cross-modal alignment in real-world, low-resource scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频生成模型虽然在潜在扩散变换器和整流流技术方面取得进展，但仍存在几何不一致、运动不稳定和视觉伪影等问题，影响了真实3D场景的呈现效果。3D一致性的视频生成对生成和重建任务具有重要意义。

Method: 采用基于偏好的优化方法，通过成对极线几何约束来对齐扩散模型，直接解决不稳定的相机轨迹和几何伪影问题。该方法高效地强制执行几何原理，无需端到端可微分性。

Result: 评估表明，经典几何约束比现代学习指标提供更稳定的优化信号，后者会产生噪声目标从而影响对齐质量。在静态场景和动态相机上训练确保了高质量测量，同时模型能有效泛化到各种动态内容。

Conclusion: 通过将数据驱动的深度学习与经典几何计算机视觉相结合，提出了一种实用的方法，在不影响视觉质量的情况下生成空间一致的视频。

Abstract: Video generation models have progressed tremendously through large latent
diffusion transformers trained with rectified flow techniques. Yet these models
still struggle with geometric inconsistencies, unstable motion, and visual
artifacts that break the illusion of realistic 3D scenes. 3D-consistent video
generation could significantly impact numerous downstream applications in
generation and reconstruction tasks. We explore how epipolar geometry
constraints improve modern video diffusion models. Despite massive training
data, these models fail to capture fundamental geometric principles underlying
visual content. We align diffusion models using pairwise epipolar geometry
constraints via preference-based optimization, directly addressing unstable
camera trajectories and geometric artifacts through mathematically principled
geometric enforcement. Our approach efficiently enforces geometric principles
without requiring end-to-end differentiability. Evaluation demonstrates that
classical geometric constraints provide more stable optimization signals than
modern learned metrics, which produce noisy targets that compromise alignment
quality. Training on static scenes with dynamic cameras ensures high-quality
measurements while the model generalizes effectively to diverse dynamic
content. By bridging data-driven deep learning with classical geometric
computer vision, we present a practical method for generating spatially
consistent videos without compromising visual quality.

Motivation: 点云数据在不同领域的训练数据规模有限，现有方法通过混合不同领域数据进行MAE预训练，但学到的先验知识与下游任务不匹配，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出DAP-MAE，包含异构领域适配器（预训练时使用适应模式，微调时使用融合模式）和领域特征生成器，指导点云特征适应不同下游任务。

Result: 仅需一次预训练，在四个点云分析任务中表现优异：ScanObjectNN物体分类达到95.18%，Bosphorus面部表情识别达到88.45%。

Conclusion: DAP-MAE能有效解决跨领域点云数据预训练问题，通过自适应整合不同领域知识，显著提升下游任务性能。

Abstract: Compared to 2D data, the scale of point cloud data in different domains
available for training, is quite limited. Researchers have been trying to
combine these data of different domains for masked autoencoder (MAE)
pre-training to leverage such a data scarcity issue. However, the prior
knowledge learned from mixed domains may not align well with the downstream 3D
point cloud analysis tasks, leading to degraded performance. To address such an
issue, we propose the Domain-Adaptive Point Cloud Masked Autoencoder (DAP-MAE),
an MAE pre-training method, to adaptively integrate the knowledge of
cross-domain datasets for general point cloud analysis. In DAP-MAE, we design a
heterogeneous domain adapter that utilizes an adaptation mode during
pre-training, enabling the model to comprehensively learn information from
point clouds across different domains, while employing a fusion mode in the
fine-tuning to enhance point cloud features. Meanwhile, DAP-MAE incorporates a
domain feature generator to guide the adaptation of point cloud features to
various downstream tasks. With only one pre-training, DAP-MAE achieves
excellent performance across four different point cloud analysis tasks,
reaching 95.18% in object classification on ScanObjectNN and 88.45% in facial
expression recognition on Bosphorus.

### [67] [Long-tailed Species Recognition in the NACTI Wildlife Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21657)
*Zehua Liu,Tilo Burghardt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究系统评估了长尾识别方法在NACTI野生动物数据集上的表现，通过实验优化LTR损失函数和正则化策略，显著提升了物种识别准确率，并在跨域测试中验证了模型的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NACTI野生动物数据集存在严重的类别不平衡问题，最大的'Head'类别占数据集的50%以上，这影响了模型对尾部类别的识别性能。

Method: 基于PyTorch Wildlife模型，系统研究了多种LTR损失函数和LTR敏感的正则化方法，构建了减少偏差的测试集评估域偏移情况。

Result: 最佳配置在NACTI测试集上达到99.40%的Top-1准确率，相比标准交叉熵的95.51%有显著提升；在跨域测试中达到52.55%的准确率，展示了更强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: LTR增强方法在野生动物识别领域表现优异，特别是在与先进LTR损失函数结合时，但仍存在尾部类别在严重域偏移下性能崩溃的问题。

Abstract: As most ''in the wild'' data collections of the natural world, the North
America Camera Trap Images (NACTI) dataset shows severe long-tailed class
imbalance, noting that the largest 'Head' class alone covers >50% of the 3.7M
images in the corpus. Building on the PyTorch Wildlife model, we present a
systematic study of Long-Tail Recognition methodologies for species recognition
on the NACTI dataset covering experiments on various LTR loss functions plus
LTR-sensitive regularisation. Our best configuration achieves 99.40% Top-1
accuracy on our NACTI test data split, substantially improving over a 95.51%
baseline using standard cross-entropy with Adam. This also improves on
previously reported top performance in MLWIC2 at 96.8% albeit using partly
unpublished (potentially different) partitioning, optimiser, and evaluation
protocols. To evaluate domain shifts (e.g. night-time captures, occlusion,
motion-blur) towards other datasets we construct a Reduced-Bias Test set from
the ENA-Detection dataset where our experimentally optimised long-tail enhanced
model achieves leading 52.55% accuracy (up from 51.20% with WCE loss),
demonstrating stronger generalisation capabilities under distribution shift. We
document the consistent improvements of LTR-enhancing scheduler choices in this
NACTI wildlife domain, particularly when in tandem with state-of-the-art LTR
losses. We finally discuss qualitative and quantitative shortcomings that LTR
methods cannot sufficiently address, including catastrophic breakdown for
'Tail' classes under severe domain shift. For maximum reproducibility we
publish all dataset splits, key code, and full network weights.

*Aarav Shetty,Gary B Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于邻近突触相似性的无监督突触分类方法，无需预先知道突触类型数量，可应用于果蝇数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统突触分类需要监督学习，但该方法仅基于邻近突触比随机选择的突触更相似的观察，无需预先标注。

Method: 利用邻近突触相似性进行无监督分类，不依赖已知类别标签，自动发现突触类型。

Result: 成功应用于果蝇数据，能够有效分离突触类型。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种无需预先知道类型数量的突触分类方式，并为选择代表性地面真值提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: Separating synapses into different classes based on their appearance in EM
images has many applications in biology. Examples may include assigning a
neurotransmitter to a particular class, or separating synapses whose strength
can be modulated from those whose strength is fixed. Traditionally, this has
been done in a supervised manner, giving the classification algorithm examples
of the different classes. Here we instead separate synapses into classes based
only on the observation that nearby synapses in the same neuron are likely more
similar than synapses chosen randomly from different cells. We apply our
methodology to data from {\it Drosophila}. Our approach has the advantage that
the number of synapse types does not need to be known in advance. It may also
provide a principled way to select ground-truth that spans the range of synapse
structure.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 评估UNI和Virchow2两种基础模型在皮肤病理学全玻片图像分类中的表现，发现Virchow2在大多数分类器中表现更优，逻辑回归达到90%准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤病理学中全玻片图像的快速生成需要自动化方法进行高效处理和准确分类。

Method: 使用UNI和Virchow2作为特征提取器，通过均值聚合策略将补丁级嵌入聚合成玻片级特征，然后训练多种机器学习分类器。

Result: Virchow2提取的特征在大多数玻片级分类器中优于UNI，逻辑回归达到最高准确率90%，但差异无统计学意义。

Conclusion: 基础模型在自动化全玻片图像分类中具有潜力，为皮肤病理学诊断提供了可扩展且有效的方法。

Abstract: The rapid generation of whole-slide images (WSIs) in dermatopathology
necessitates automated methods for efficient processing and accurate
classification. This study evaluates the performance of two foundation models,
UNI and Virchow2, as feature extractors for classifying WSIs into three
diagnostic categories: melanocytic, basaloid, and squamous lesions. Patch-level
embeddings were aggregated into slide-level features using a mean-aggregation
strategy and subsequently used to train multiple machine learning classifiers,
including logistic regression, gradient-boosted trees, and random forest
models. Performance was assessed using precision, recall, true positive rate,
false positive rate, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve (AUROC) on the test set. Results demonstrate that patch-level features
extracted using Virchow2 outperformed those extracted via UNI across most
slide-level classifiers, with logistic regression achieving the highest
accuracy (90%) for Virchow2, though the difference was not statistically
significant. The study also explored data augmentation techniques and image
normalization to enhance model robustness and generalizability. The
mean-aggregation approach provided reliable slide-level feature
representations. All experimental results and metrics were tracked and
visualized using WandB.ai, facilitating reproducibility and interpretability.
This research highlights the potential of foundation models for automated WSI
classification, providing a scalable and effective approach for
dermatopathological diagnosis while paving the way for future advancements in
slide-level representation learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BachVid是一种无需训练的方法，通过分析DiT的注意力机制和中间特征，实现无需参考图像的多视频一致生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖参考图像或大量训练，且往往只解决角色一致性，背景一致性仍需依赖图像到视频模型。

Method: 基于对DiT注意力机制和中间特征的系统分析，先生成身份视频并缓存中间变量，然后将这些变量注入到新生成视频的对应位置。

Result: 实验结果表明BachVid在无需额外训练的情况下实现了生成视频的鲁棒一致性。

Conclusion: BachVid提供了一种新颖且高效的解决方案，无需依赖参考图像或额外训练即可实现一致视频生成。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently driven significant progress in
text-to-video (T2V) generation. However, generating multiple videos with
consistent characters and backgrounds remains a significant challenge. Existing
methods typically rely on reference images or extensive training, and often
only address character consistency, leaving background consistency to
image-to-video models. We introduce BachVid, the first training-free method
that achieves consistent video generation without needing any reference images.
Our approach is based on a systematic analysis of DiT's attention mechanism and
intermediate features, revealing its ability to extract foreground masks and
identify matching points during the denoising process. Our method leverages
this finding by first generating an identity video and caching the intermediate
variables, and then inject these cached variables into corresponding positions
in newly generated videos, ensuring both foreground and background consistency
across multiple videos. Experimental results demonstrate that BachVid achieves
robust consistency in generated videos without requiring additional training,
offering a novel and efficient solution for consistent video generation without
relying on reference images or additional training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 视觉扩散模型可以直接在像素空间中解决几何问题，将几何推理转化为图像生成任务


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉扩散模型作为几何求解器的潜力，解决传统上难以处理的几何问题

Method: 将几何问题实例视为图像，训练标准视觉扩散模型从高斯噪声生成近似解图像

Result: 成功应用于三个经典几何难题：内接正方形问题、斯坦纳树问题和简单多边形问题

Conclusion: 图像空间为近似解决困难几何问题提供了通用框架，连接了生成建模与几何求解

Abstract: In this paper we show that visual diffusion models can serve as effective
geometric solvers: they can directly reason about geometric problems by working
in pixel space. We first demonstrate this on the Inscribed Square Problem, a
long-standing problem in geometry that asks whether every Jordan curve contains
four points forming a square. We then extend the approach to two other
well-known hard geometric problems: the Steiner Tree Problem and the Simple
Polygon Problem.
  Our method treats each problem instance as an image and trains a standard
visual diffusion model that transforms Gaussian noise into an image
representing a valid approximate solution that closely matches the exact one.
The model learns to transform noisy geometric structures into correct
configurations, effectively recasting geometric reasoning as image generation.
  Unlike prior work that necessitates specialized architectures and
domain-specific adaptations when applying diffusion to parametric geometric
representations, we employ a standard visual diffusion model that operates on
the visual representation of the problem. This simplicity highlights a
surprising bridge between generative modeling and geometric problem solving.
Beyond the specific problems studied here, our results point toward a broader
paradigm: operating in image space provides a general and practical framework
for approximating notoriously hard problems, and opens the door to tackling a
far wider class of challenging geometric tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检测视觉模型在图像识别中对特定视觉属性的意外依赖，这对确保模型鲁棒性、防止过拟合和避免虚假相关性至关重要。

Method: 使用自反思代理系统生成和测试关于模型可能依赖的视觉属性的假设，通过迭代实验和自我评估协议来完善假设。

Result: 在包含130个模型的基准测试中，自反思方法显著优于非反思基线，并能识别CLIP视觉编码器和YOLOv8等先进模型中的真实视觉属性依赖。

Conclusion: 自反思代理能有效识别视觉模型中的属性依赖，其性能随反思过程持续提升，为模型诊断和改进提供了有力工具。

Abstract: When a vision model performs image recognition, which visual attributes drive
its predictions? Detecting unintended reliance on specific visual features is
critical for ensuring model robustness, preventing overfitting, and avoiding
spurious correlations. We introduce an automated framework for detecting such
dependencies in trained vision models. At the core of our method is a
self-reflective agent that systematically generates and tests hypotheses about
visual attributes that a model may rely on. This process is iterative: the
agent refines its hypotheses based on experimental outcomes and uses a
self-evaluation protocol to assess whether its findings accurately explain
model behavior. When inconsistencies arise, the agent self-reflects over its
findings and triggers a new cycle of experimentation. We evaluate our approach
on a novel benchmark of 130 models designed to exhibit diverse visual attribute
dependencies across 18 categories. Our results show that the agent's
performance consistently improves with self-reflection, with a significant
performance increase over non-reflective baselines. We further demonstrate that
the agent identifies real-world visual attribute dependencies in
state-of-the-art models, including CLIP's vision encoder and the YOLOv8 object
detector.

*Abir Khan Ratul,Sanjay Acharjee,Somin Park,Md Nazmus Sakib*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种人机协作流程，将手绘平面图转换为语义一致的3D BIM模型，使用多模态大语言模型和多智能体框架，通过迭代反馈实现高精度转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 让专家和非专家都能通过简单的手绘草图创建BIM模型，降低BIM创建的门槛。

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型的多智能体框架，结合感知提取、人工反馈、模式验证和自动化BIM脚本生成，将手绘草图迭代转换为结构化JSON布局，再生成3D BIM模型。

Result: 在10个不同平面图上测试，门窗口检测初始准确率高，墙体检测从83%开始，经过几次反馈迭代后达到近乎完美对齐。所有类别的精确率、召回率和F1分数均超过0.83，几何误差通过反馈修正逐渐降至零。

Conclusion: MLLM驱动的多智能体推理能够使BIM创建对专家和非专家都变得可访问，仅需使用手绘草图即可实现。

Abstract: This study introduces a human-in-the-loop pipeline that converts unscaled,
hand-drawn floor plan sketches into semantically consistent 3D BIM models. The
workflow leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) within a
multi-agent framework, combining perceptual extraction, human feedback, schema
validation, and automated BIM scripting. Initially, sketches are iteratively
refined into a structured JSON layout of walls, doors, and windows. Later,
these layouts are transformed into executable scripts that generate 3D BIM
models. Experiments on ten diverse floor plans demonstrate strong convergence:
openings (doors, windows) are captured with high reliability in the initial
pass, while wall detection begins around 83% and achieves near-perfect
alignment after a few feedback iterations. Across all categories, precision,
recall, and F1 scores remain above 0.83, and geometric errors (RMSE, MAE)
progressively decrease to zero through feedback corrections. This study
demonstrates how MLLM-driven multi-agent reasoning can make BIM creation
accessible to both experts and non-experts using only freehand sketches.

TL;DR: 提出Cultural Alien Sampler (CAS)方法，通过分离概念组合的连贯性和文化典型性，生成既具有内部一致性又偏离文化惯例的创意概念组合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前大语言模型在开放领域创意生成中要么陷入熟悉文化模式，要么在追求新颖性时牺牲连贯性的问题。

Method: 使用两个在WikiArt概念上微调的GPT-2模型：概念连贯性模型评估概念在艺术作品中共同出现的可能性，文化背景模型估计这些组合在艺术家作品中的典型程度。CAS选择高连贯性、低典型性的概念组合。

Result: 在人类评估中优于随机选择和GPT-4o基线，在感知原创性和和谐性方面与艺术学生表现相当。定量研究显示比GPT-4o产生更多样化的输出和更广泛的概念空间探索。

Conclusion: 人工文化异化可以释放自主代理的创意潜力，生成既新颖又连贯的创意概念。

Abstract: In open-ended domains like art, autonomous agents must generate ideas that
are both original and internally coherent, yet current Large Language Models
(LLMs) either default to familiar cultural patterns or sacrifice coherence when
pushed toward novelty. We address this by introducing the Cultural Alien
Sampler (CAS), a concept-selection method that explicitly separates
compositional fit from cultural typicality. CAS uses two GPT-2 models
fine-tuned on WikiArt concepts: a Concept Coherence Model that scores whether
concepts plausibly co-occur within artworks, and a Cultural Context Model that
estimates how typical those combinations are within individual artists' bodies
of work. CAS targets combinations that are high in coherence and low in
typicality, yielding ideas that maintain internal consistency while deviating
from learned conventions and embedded cultural context. In a human evaluation
(N = 100), our approach outperforms random selection and GPT-4o baselines and
achieves performance comparable to human art students in both perceived
originality and harmony. Additionally, a quantitative study shows that our
method produces more diverse outputs and explores a broader conceptual space
than its GPT-4o counterpart, demonstrating that artificial cultural alienness
can unlock creative potential in autonomous agents.

Motivation: 传统模糊数运算存在三个主要问题：高计算复杂度、运算结果可能不保持原有特征（如两个三角模糊数相乘结果不是三角模糊数）、以及模糊扩散问题。这些问题限制了模糊数的应用范围。

Result: 提出了外延模糊数的完整运算框架，包括C++实现，可从GitHub公共仓库获取。

Conclusion: 外延模糊数方法能够有效解决传统模糊数运算中的问题，为模糊数的应用提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Fuzzy numbers are commonly represented with fuzzy sets. Their objective is to
better represent imprecise data. However, operations on fuzzy numbers are not
as straightforward as maths on crisp numbers. Commonly, the Zadeh's extension
rule is applied to elaborate a result. This can produce two problems: (1) high
computational complexity and (2) for some fuzzy sets and some operations the
results is not a fuzzy set with the same features (eg. multiplication of two
triangular fuzzy sets does not produce a triangular fuzzy set). One more
problem is the fuzzy spread -- fuzziness of the result increases with the
number of operations. These facts can severely limit the application field of
fuzzy numbers. In this paper we would like to revisite this problem with a
different kind of fuzzy numbers -- extensional fuzzy numbers. The paper defines
operations on extensional fuzzy numbers and relational operators (=, >, >=, <,
<=) for them. The proposed approach is illustrated with several applicational
examples. The C++ implementation is available from a public GitHub repository.

Motivation: 解决不同电子健康记录系统中药物数据格式不统一的问题，特别是阿片类药物使用障碍治疗处方的标准化监测需求。

Method: 定制开源大语言模型（Llama、Qwen、Gemma、MedGemma）从异构数据中提取处方属性，通过JSON模式处理、归一化和一致性检查构建标准化药物覆盖天数指标。

Result: 在5个诊所的25,605条记录上评估，Qwen2.5-32B达到93.4%覆盖率和93.0%精确匹配准确率，MedGemma-27B达到93.1%/92.2%。

Conclusion: 该方法消除了脆弱的站点特定ETL流程，支持本地隐私保护部署，为现实环境中MOUD暴露、依从性和保留的跨站点分析提供一致框架。

Abstract: Harmonizing medication data across Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems is
a persistent barrier to monitoring medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD).
In heterogeneous EHR systems, key prescription attributes are scattered across
differently formatted fields and freetext notes. We present a practical
framework that customizes open source large language models (LLMs), including
Llama, Qwen, Gemma, and MedGemma, to extract a unified set of MOUD prescription
attributes (prescription date, drug name, duration, total quantity, daily
quantity, and refills) from heterogeneous, site specific data and compute a
standardized metric of medication coverage, \emph{MOUD days}, per patient. Our
pipeline processes records directly in a fixed JSON schema, followed by
lightweight normalization and cross-field consistency checks. We evaluate the
system on prescription level EHR data from five clinics in a national OUD study
(25{,}605 records from 1{,}257 patients), using a previously annotated
benchmark of 10{,}369 records (776 patients) as the ground truth. Performance
is reported as coverage (share of records with a valid, matchable output) and
record-level exact-match accuracy. Larger models perform best overall:
Qwen2.5-32B achieves \textbf{93.4\%} coverage with \textbf{93.0\%} exact-match
accuracy across clinics, and MedGemma-27B attains
\textbf{93.1\%}/\textbf{92.2\%}. A brief error review highlights three common
issues and fixes: imputing missing dosage fields using within-drug norms,
handling monthly/weekly injectables (e.g., Vivitrol) by setting duration from
the documented schedule, and adding unit checks to prevent mass units (e.g.,
``250 g'') from being misread as daily counts. By removing brittle,
site-specific ETL and supporting local, privacy-preserving deployment, this
approach enables consistent cross-site analyses of MOUD exposure, adherence,
and retention in real-world settings.

Motivation: 基于社会认识论，探讨AI系统作为人工认识权威(AEAs)的资格，以及何时应该优先采用AI输出而非人类专家判断，解决AI与人类认知权威的关系问题。

Method: 通过分析AI优先主义观点及其经典反对意见，发展出全证据观点作为替代方案，强调AI输出应作为贡献性理由而非完全替代人类独立认知。

Result: 全证据观点具有三个关键优势：缓解专业知识萎缩、为有意义的人类监督提供认识论依据、解释AI可靠性条件不满足时的合理不信任。

Conclusion: 全证据观点提供了一个原则性的方法来确定AI服从的合理性，特别是在需要严格可靠性的高风险情境中，虽然实践上要求较高，但更具前景。

Abstract: When should we defer to AI outputs over human expert judgment? Drawing on
recent work in social epistemology, I motivate the idea that some AI systems
qualify as Artificial Epistemic Authorities (AEAs) due to their demonstrated
reliability and epistemic superiority. I then introduce AI Preemptionism, the
view that AEA outputs should replace rather than supplement a user's
independent epistemic reasons. I show that classic objections to preemptionism
- such as uncritical deference, epistemic entrenchment, and unhinging epistemic
bases - apply in amplified form to AEAs, given their opacity, self-reinforcing
authority, and lack of epistemic failure markers. Against this, I develop a
more promising alternative: a total evidence view of AI deference. According to
this view, AEA outputs should function as contributory reasons rather than
outright replacements for a user's independent epistemic considerations. This
approach has three key advantages: (i) it mitigates expertise atrophy by
keeping human users engaged, (ii) it provides an epistemic case for meaningful
human oversight and control, and (iii) it explains the justified mistrust of AI
when reliability conditions are unmet. While demanding in practice, this
account offers a principled way to determine when AI deference is justified,
particularly in high-stakes contexts requiring rigorous reliability.

Motivation: SQL的复杂性和PostGIS等工具中地理空间函数的专业性为非专家分析空间数据设置了障碍，现有单智能体方法难以处理空间查询的语义和句法复杂性。

Method: 开发了包含知识库、程序化模式分析、语义增强、上下文检索嵌入和多智能体协作管道的框架，包括实体提取、元数据检索、查询逻辑制定、SQL生成和验证代理。

Result: 在KaggleDBQA基准测试中达到81.2%准确率，在空间查询测试中达到87.7%准确率，相比无验证代理的76.7%有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该工作使空间分析更易访问，为空间Text-to-SQL系统提供了鲁棒且可推广的基础，推动了自主GIS的发展。

Abstract: The complexity of Structured Query Language (SQL) and the specialized nature
of geospatial functions in tools like PostGIS present significant barriers to
non-experts seeking to analyze spatial data. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
offer promise for translating natural language into SQL (Text-to-SQL),
single-agent approaches often struggle with the semantic and syntactic
complexities of spatial queries. To address this, we propose a multi-agent
framework designed to accurately translate natural language questions into
spatial SQL queries. The framework integrates several innovative components,
including a knowledge base with programmatic schema profiling and semantic
enrichment, embeddings for context retrieval, and a collaborative multi-agent
pipeline as its core. This pipeline comprises specialized agents for entity
extraction, metadata retrieval, query logic formulation, SQL generation, and a
review agent that performs programmatic and semantic validation of the
generated SQL to ensure correctness (self-verification). We evaluate our system
using both the non-spatial KaggleDBQA benchmark and a new, comprehensive
SpatialQueryQA benchmark that includes diverse geometry types, predicates, and
three levels of query complexity. On KaggleDBQA, the system achieved an overall
accuracy of 81.2% (221 out of 272 questions) after the review agent's review
and corrections. For spatial queries, the system achieved an overall accuracy
of 87.7% (79 out of 90 questions), compared with 76.7% without the review
agent. Beyond accuracy, results also show that in some instances the system
generates queries that are more semantically aligned with user intent than
those in the benchmarks. This work makes spatial analysis more accessible, and
provides a robust, generalizable foundation for spatial Text-to-SQL systems,
advancing the development of autonomous GIS.

Abstract: Recently, large models have shown significant potential for smart healthcare.
However, the deployment of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for clinical
services is currently hindered by three critical challenges: a tendency to
hallucinate answers not grounded in visual evidence, the inefficiency of
fixed-depth reasoning, and the difficulty of multi-institutional collaboration.
To address these challenges, in this paper, we develop MedAlign, a novel
framework to ensure visually accurate LVLM responses for Medical Visual
Question Answering (Med-VQA). Specifically, we first propose a multimodal
Direct Preference Optimization (mDPO) objective to explicitly align preference
learning with visual context. We then design a Retrieval-Aware
Mixture-of-Experts (RA-MoE) architecture that utilizes image and text
similarity to route queries to a specialized and context-augmented LVLM (i.e.,
an expert), thereby mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs. To achieve adaptive
reasoning and facilitate multi-institutional collaboration, we propose a
federated governance mechanism, where the selected expert, fine-tuned on
clinical datasets based on mDPO, locally performs iterative Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning via the local meta-cognitive uncertainty estimator. Extensive
experiments on three representative Med-VQA datasets demonstrate that MedAlign
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong retrieval-augmented
baselines by up to $11.85\%$ in F1-score, and simultaneously reducing the
average reasoning length by $51.60\%$ compared with fixed-depth CoT approaches.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的深度强化学习算法，能够处理观测数据中的混淆偏差，在存在未观测混淆因子的复杂高维环境中实现鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在存在未观测混淆因子的复杂高维环境中，传统的离策略学习方法（如Q学习）可能因数据偏差而失效，需要开发对混淆偏差具有鲁棒性的算法。

Method: 基于深度Q网络（DQN），提出了一种寻找与观测兼容的最坏情况环境下安全策略的新算法。

Result: 在12个存在混淆的Atari游戏中测试，该算法在所有存在行为策略和目标策略输入不匹配以及未观测混淆因子的游戏中始终优于标准DQN。

Conclusion: 所提出的算法能够有效处理观测数据中的混淆偏差，在存在未观测混淆因子的复杂环境中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: A key task in Artificial Intelligence is learning effective policies for
controlling agents in unknown environments to optimize performance measures.
Off-policy learning methods, like Q-learning, allow learners to make optimal
decisions based on past experiences. This paper studies off-policy learning
from biased data in complex and high-dimensional domains where \emph{unobserved
confounding} cannot be ruled out a priori. Building on the well-celebrated Deep
Q-Network (DQN), we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm
robust to confounding biases in observed data. Specifically, our algorithm
attempts to find a safe policy for the worst-case environment compatible with
the observations. We apply our method to twelve confounded Atari games, and
find that it consistently dominates the standard DQN in all games where the
observed input to the behavioral and target policies mismatch and unobserved
confounders exist.

Abstract: This paper presents a first empirical study of agentic AI as autonomous
decision-makers in decentralized governance. Using more than 3K proposals from
major protocols, we build an agentic AI voter that interprets proposal
contexts, retrieves historical deliberation data, and independently determines
its voting position. The agent operates within a realistic financial simulation
environment grounded in verifiable blockchain data, implemented through a
modular composable program (MCP) workflow that defines data flow and tool usage
via Agentics framework. We evaluate how closely the agent's decisions align
with the human and token-weighted outcomes, uncovering strong alignments
measured by carefully designed evaluation metrics. Our findings demonstrate
that agentic AI can augment collective decision-making by producing
interpretable, auditable, and empirically grounded signals in realistic DAO
governance settings. The study contributes to the design of explainable and
economically rigorous AI agents for decentralized financial systems.

TL;DR: 提出了PACE数据集和PACER咨询模型，用于恐慌发作场景下的心理支持，通过多维度评估框架验证其有效性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恐慌发作需要及时干预，但缺乏合适的训练数据集，存在伦理和物流问题

Method: 构建PACE数据集，训练PACER咨询模型，使用监督学习和模拟偏好对齐优化，提出PanicEval评估框架

Result: PACER在咨询质量和客户情绪改善方面优于基线模型，人类评估显示在恐慌场景中优于通用、CBT和GPT-4模型

Conclusion: PACER在恐慌发作干预中表现出实用价值，为心理危机支持提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Panic attacks are acute episodes of fear and distress, in which timely,
appropriate intervention can significantly help individuals regain stability.
However, suitable datasets for training such models remain scarce due to
ethical and logistical issues. To address this, we introduce PACE, which is a
dataset that includes high-distress episodes constructed from first-person
narratives, and structured around the principles of Psychological First Aid
(PFA). Using this data, we train PACER, a counseling model designed to provide
both empathetic and directive support, which is optimized through supervised
learning and simulated preference alignment. To assess its effectiveness, we
propose PanicEval, a multi-dimensional framework covering general counseling
quality and crisis-specific strategies. Experimental results show that PACER
outperforms strong baselines in both counselor-side metrics and client affect
improvement. Human evaluations further confirm its practical value, with PACER
consistently preferred over general, CBT-based, and GPT-4-powered models in
panic scenarios (Code is available at https://github.com/JihyunLee1/PanicToCalm

TL;DR: 提出了NeuroGenPoisoning攻击框架，通过分析LLM内部神经元归因和遗传优化来生成对抗性外部知识，有效实现RAG系统的大规模投毒攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG投毒攻击主要关注检索内容或提示结构，忽略了模型内部表示动态和神经元级敏感性，且未充分考虑与强参数化知识的知识冲突问题。

Method: 首先识别与上下文投毒知识强相关的毒害响应神经元，然后使用遗传算法进化对抗性段落以最大化激活这些神经元，并通过观察归因信号重用有潜力但初始不成功的外部知识变体。

Result: 在不同模型和数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法能持续实现超过90%的群体覆盖成功率，同时保持流畅性，有效解决了知识冲突问题。

Conclusion: NeuroGenPoisoning框架通过神经元归因引导的投毒方法，能够有效实现大规模RAG系统投毒攻击，并成功解决知识冲突问题。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to
dynamically integrate external knowledge during inference, improving their
factual accuracy and adaptability. However, adversaries can inject poisoned
external knowledge to override the model's internal memory. While existing
attacks iteratively manipulate retrieval content or prompt structure of RAG,
they largely ignore the model's internal representation dynamics and
neuron-level sensitivities. The underlying mechanism of RAG poisoning has not
been fully studied and the effect of knowledge conflict with strong parametric
knowledge in RAG is not considered. In this work, we propose NeuroGenPoisoning,
a novel attack framework that generates adversarial external knowledge in RAG
guided by LLM internal neuron attribution and genetic optimization. Our method
first identifies a set of Poison-Responsive Neurons whose activation strongly
correlates with contextual poisoning knowledge. We then employ a genetic
algorithm to evolve adversarial passages that maximally activate these neurons.
Crucially, our framework enables massive-scale generation of effective poisoned
RAG knowledge by identifying and reusing promising but initially unsuccessful
external knowledge variants via observed attribution signals. At the same time,
Poison-Responsive Neurons guided poisoning can effectively resolves knowledge
conflict. Experimental results across models and datasets demonstrate
consistently achieving high Population Overwrite Success Rate (POSR) of over
90% while preserving fluency. Empirical evidence shows that our method
effectively resolves knowledge conflict.

TL;DR: EGO-Prompt是一个自动化的提示优化框架，通过进化图优化方法改进LLM的提示设计和推理过程，在领域特定任务中显著提升性能并降低成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实应用中，为大型语言模型设计针对领域特定任务的最优提示和推理过程既必要又具挑战性。如何整合领域知识、提高推理效率，以及为领域专家提供知识整合提示都是关键但未解决的问题。

Method: 提出EGO-Prompt框架，从专家构建的初始语义因果图开始，通过因果引导的文本梯度过程自动优化：首先生成确定性推理指导，然后让LLM适应使用该指导与原始输入。迭代优化算法使用文本梯度和真实数据进一步优化语义因果图和推理机制。

Result: 在公共卫生、交通和人类行为任务上的测试显示，EGO-Prompt比前沿方法F1分数提高7.32%-12.61%，让小模型以不到20%的成本达到大模型性能，并输出精炼的领域特定语义因果图提高可解释性。

Conclusion: EGO-Prompt成功解决了领域特定任务中提示设计和推理优化的挑战，通过自动化框架显著提升了LLM性能，同时降低了计算成本并增强了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Designing optimal prompts and reasoning processes for large language models
(LLMs) on domain-specific tasks is both necessary and challenging in real-world
applications. Determining how to integrate domain knowledge, enhance reasoning
efficiency, and even provide domain experts with refined knowledge integration
hints are particularly crucial yet unresolved tasks. In this research, we
propose Evolutionary Graph Optimization for Prompting (EGO-Prompt), an
automated framework to designing better prompts, efficient reasoning processes
and providing enhanced causal-informed process. EGO-Prompt begins with a
general prompt and fault-tolerant initial Semantic Causal Graph (SCG)
descriptions, constructed by human experts, which is then automatically refined
and optimized to guide LLM reasoning. Recognizing that expert-defined SCGs may
be partial or imperfect and that their optimal integration varies across LLMs,
EGO-Prompt integrates a novel causal-guided textual gradient process in two
steps: first, generating nearly deterministic reasoning guidance from the SCG
for each instance, and second, adapting the LLM to effectively utilize the
guidance alongside the original input. The iterative optimization algorithm
further refines both the SCG and the reasoning mechanism using textual
gradients with ground-truth. We tested the framework on real-world public
health, transportation and human behavior tasks. EGO-Prompt achieves
7.32%-12.61% higher F1 than cutting-edge methods, and allows small models to
reach the performence of larger models at under 20% of the original cost. It
also outputs a refined, domain-specific SCG that improves interpretability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SSoT是一种新颖的提示方法，通过让LLM先生成随机字符串来增加熵，然后从中提取随机性来改善概率指令跟随(PIF)性能，提高回答多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在需要单一确定性答案的任务上表现出色，但在概率指令跟随(PIF)任务中表现不佳，存在偏见问题，影响需要非确定性行为的应用如人类行为模拟、内容多样化和多人游戏。

Method: 提出SSoT提示方法：首先让LLM输出随机字符串生成足够熵，然后通过操作该字符串提取随机性来得出最终答案，在保持多样性的同时遵循特定约束。

Result: SSoT显著提高了LLMs的PIF性能，接近伪随机数生成器的理想性能。在NoveltyBench上的实验表明SSoT还能增强开放任务的回答多样性。

Conclusion: SSoT是一种简单有效的提示方法，能够有效改善LLMs在概率指令跟随任务中的表现，并增强生成回答的多样性。

Abstract: We introduce String Seed of Thought (SSoT), a novel prompting method for LLMs
that improves Probabilistic Instruction Following (PIF). We define PIF as a
task requiring an LLM to select its answer from a predefined set of options,
each associated with a specific probability, such that the empirical
distribution of the generated answers aligns with the target distribution when
prompted multiple times. While LLMs excel at tasks with single, deterministic
answers, they often fail at PIF, exhibiting biases problematic for applications
requiring non-deterministic behaviors, such as human-behavior simulation,
content diversification, and multiplayer games. It also harms the diversity of
generated responses, a crucial factor in test-time scaling, by causing the
outputs to collapse into a limited set of answers. To address this, we propose
SSoT, a simple prompting method that instructs an LLM to first output a random
string to generate sufficient entropy. SSoT also instructs the LLM to extract
randomness by manipulating this string to derive a final answer, thereby
preserving diversity while adhering to specific constraints. We demonstrate
that SSoT significantly improves the PIF performance of LLMs, approaching the
ideal performance of a pseudo-random number generator. Furthermore, our
experiments on NoveltyBench show SSoT's benefits extend beyond closed-set tasks
to open-ended tasks by enhancing response diversity.

TL;DR: 提出了NuSA-CL框架，一种轻量级无内存的持续学习方法，通过低秩适应和约束权重更新在参数近似零空间内，保护预训练视觉语言模型的零样本能力，避免灾难性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练视觉语言模型在现实部署中面临分布偏移和新任务挑战，静态零样本能力不足，需要持续学习方法来适应环境变化同时避免遗忘已有知识。

Method: 使用低秩适应技术，将任务特定的权重更新约束在当前模型参数的近似零空间内，最小化对已学习知识的干扰，无需重放缓冲区或昂贵的蒸馏过程。

Result: 实验表明该框架有效保护零样本迁移能力，在持续学习基准测试中取得有竞争力的性能，计算和内存开销最小。

Conclusion: NuSA-CL为现实应用中持续演化的零样本视觉语言模型提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
remarkable zero-shot generalization, enabling deployment in a wide range of
real-world tasks without additional task-specific training. However, in real
deployment scenarios with evolving environments or emerging classes, these
models inevitably face distributional shifts and novel tasks. In such contexts,
static zero-shot capabilities are insufficient, and there is a growing need for
continual learning methods that allow models to adapt over time while avoiding
catastrophic forgetting. We introduce NuSA-CL (Null Space Adaptation for
Continual Learning), a lightweight memory-free continual learning framework
designed to address this challenge. NuSA-CL employs low-rank adaptation and
constrains task-specific weight updates to lie within an approximate null space
of the model's current parameters. This strategy minimizes interference with
previously acquired knowledge, effectively preserving the zero-shot
capabilities of the original model. Unlike methods relying on replay buffers or
costly distillation, NuSA-CL imposes minimal computational and memory overhead,
making it practical for deployment in resource-constrained, real-world
continual learning environments. Experiments show that our framework not only
effectively preserves zero-shot transfer capabilities but also achieves highly
competitive performance on continual learning benchmarks. These results
position NuSA-CL as a practical and scalable solution for continually evolving
zero-shot VLMs in real-world applications.

Motivation: 现有因果关系发现方法依赖人工经验、统计方法或图形准则，容易出错、依赖理想化假设和大数据量，且在多变量时间序列中存在数据稀缺问题，现有方法容易过拟合。

Method: 使用组扩张卷积和共享核来指数级减少参数数量，同时学习带时间延迟的变量表示；结合全局约束和局部约束实现网络间信息共享；设计了数据生成方法来生成带时间延迟的多变量时间序列。

Result: 在常用基准测试和生成数据集上的广泛实验表明，Shylock在少样本和正常多变量时间序列上都优于两种现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: Shylock方法能够有效解决多变量时间序列中因果关系发现的挑战，特别是在数据稀缺情况下表现优异，并开发了Tcausal库便于使用。

Abstract: Causal relationship discovery has been drawing increasing attention due to
its prevalent application. Existing methods rely on human experience,
statistical methods, or graphical criteria methods which are error-prone, stuck
at the idealized assumption, and rely on a huge amount of data. And there is
also a serious data gap in accessing Multivariate time series(MTS) in many
areas, adding difficulty in finding their causal relationship. Existing methods
are easy to be over-fitting on them. To fill the gap we mentioned above, in
this paper, we propose Shylock, a novel method that can work well in both
few-shot and normal MTS to find the causal relationship. Shylock can reduce the
number of parameters exponentially by using group dilated convolution and a
sharing kernel, but still learn a better representation of variables with time
delay. By combing the global constraint and the local constraint, Shylock
achieves information sharing among networks to help improve the accuracy. To
evaluate the performance of Shylock, we also design a data generation method to
generate MTS with time delay. We evaluate it on commonly used benchmarks and
generated datasets. Extensive experiments show that Shylock outperforms two
existing state-of-art methods on both few-shot and normal MTS. We also
developed Tcausal, a library for easy use and deployed it on the EarthDataMiner
platform

Abstract: We propose OutboundEval, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating large

Unlike existing methods that suffer from three key limitations - insufficient
dataset diversity and category coverage, unrealistic user simulation, and
inaccurate evaluation metrics - OutboundEval addresses these issues through a
structured framework. First, we design a benchmark spanning six major business

process decomposition, weighted scoring, and domain-adaptive metrics. Second,
we develop a large-model-driven User Simulator that generates diverse,

communication styles, providing a controlled yet authentic testing environment.
Third, we introduce a dynamic evaluation method that adapts to task variations,
integrating automated and human-in-the-loop assessment to measure task
execution accuracy, professional knowledge application, adaptability, and user
experience quality. Experiments on 12 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal distinct
trade-offs between expert-level task completion and interaction fluency,
offering practical insights for building reliable, human-like outbound AI
systems. OutboundEval establishes a practical, extensible, and domain-oriented
standard for benchmarking LLMs in professional applications.

Abstract: The operational capabilities and application domains of AI-enabled autonomous
systems have expanded significantly in recent years due to advances in robotics
and machine learning (ML). Demonstrating the safety of autonomous systems
rigorously is critical for their responsible adoption but it is challenging as
it requires robust methodologies that can handle novel and uncertain situations
throughout the system lifecycle, including detecting out-of-distribution (OoD)
data. Thus, OOD detection is receiving increased attention from the research,
development and safety engineering communities. This comprehensive review
analyses OOD detection techniques within the context of safety assurance for
autonomous systems, in particular in safety-critical domains. We begin by
defining the relevant concepts, investigating what causes OOD and exploring the
factors which make the safety assurance of autonomous systems and OOD detection
challenging. Our review identifies a range of techniques which can be used
throughout the ML development lifecycle and we suggest areas within the
lifecycle in which they may be used to support safety assurance arguments. We
discuss a number of caveats that system and safety engineers must be aware of
when integrating OOD detection into system lifecycles. We conclude by outlining
the challenges and future work necessary for the safe development and operation
of autonomous systems across a range of domains and applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UCT算法对游戏奖励尺度敏感，在具有密集奖励的游戏中使用固定λ值会导致性能问题，需要开发对奖励尺度不敏感的自适应λ选择策略。

Method: 评估了文献中已有的λ选择策略，并提出了五种新策略，包括基于Q值经验标准差的方法。

Result: 新提出的λ=2σ策略在各种任务中表现最佳，无论是使用单一参数值还是优化所有可用参数时的峰值性能都优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 推荐使用新提出的λ=2σ策略作为UCT探索常数的自适应选择方法，该方法对游戏奖励尺度不敏感且性能优越。

Abstract: The Upper Confidence Bounds For Trees (UCT) algorithm is not agnostic to the
reward scale of the game it is applied to. For zero-sum games with the sparse
rewards of $\{-1,0,1\}$ at the end of the game, this is not a problem, but many
games often feature dense rewards with hand-picked reward scales, causing a
node's Q-value to span different magnitudes across different games. In this
paper, we evaluate various strategies for adaptively choosing the UCT
exploration constant $\lambda$, called $\lambda$-strategies, that are agnostic
to the game's reward scale. These $\lambda$-strategies include those proposed
in the literature as well as five new strategies. Given our experimental
results, we recommend using one of our newly suggested $\lambda$-strategies,
which is to choose $\lambda$ as $2 \cdot \sigma$ where $\sigma$ is the
empirical standard deviation of all state-action pairs' Q-values of the search
tree. This method outperforms existing $\lambda$-strategies across a wide range
of tasks both in terms of a single parameter value and the peak performances
obtained by optimizing all available parameters.

Method: 提出Chain-of-Guardrail训练框架，通过重构或回溯不安全推理步骤，引导模型回到安全轨迹，同时保留有效推理链。

Result: 在多个推理和安全基准测试中，CoG显著提升了当前大型推理模型的安全性，同时保持了相当的推理能力，明显优于先前存在严重安全-推理权衡的方法。

Conclusion: CoG框架有效解决了大型推理模型的安全性与推理能力之间的权衡问题，实现了安全性的显著提升而不损害推理性能。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on complex
reasoning tasks but remain vulnerable to severe safety risks, including harmful
content generation and jailbreak attacks. Existing mitigation strategies rely
on injecting heuristic safety signals during training, which often suppress
reasoning ability and fail to resolve the safety-reasoning trade-off. To
systematically investigate this issue, we analyze the reasoning trajectories of
diverse LRMs and uncover a phenomenon we term Self-Jailbreak, where models
override their own risk assessments and justify responding to unsafe prompts.
This finding reveals that LRMs inherently possess the ability to reject unsafe
queries, but this ability is compromised, resulting in harmful outputs.
Building on these insights, we propose the Chain-of-Guardrail (CoG), a training
framework that recomposes or backtracks unsafe reasoning steps, steering the
model back onto safe trajectories while preserving valid reasoning chains.
Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning and safety benchmarks
demonstrate that CoG substantially improves the safety of current LRMs while
preserving comparable reasoning ability, significantly outperforming prior
methods that suffer from severe safety-reasoning trade-offs.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the automatic
generation of executable code for task planning and control in embodied agents
such as robots, demonstrating the potential of LLM-based embodied intelligence.
However, these LLM-based code-as-policies approaches often suffer from limited
environmental grounding, particularly in dynamic or partially observable
settings, leading to suboptimal task success rates due to incorrect or
incomplete code generation. In this work, we propose a neuro-symbolic embodied
task planning framework that incorporates explicit symbolic verification and
interactive validation processes during code generation. In the validation
phase, the framework generates exploratory code that actively interacts with
the environment to acquire missing observations while preserving task-relevant
states. This integrated process enhances the grounding of generated code,
resulting in improved task reliability and success rates in complex
environments. We evaluate our framework on RLBench and in real-world settings
across dynamic, partially observable scenarios. Experimental results
demonstrate that our framework improves task success rates by 46.2% over
Code-as-Policies baselines and attains over 86.8% executability of
task-relevant actions, thereby enhancing the reliability of task planning in
dynamic environments.

Motivation: 当前可信AI研究主要关注技术属性如可靠性、鲁棒性和公平性，而忽视了理解真实世界环境中AI可信度所需的社会技术维度，需要全面审视AI伦理社区如何概念化、测量和验证AI可信度。

Method: 对AIES和FAccT会议论文集进行范围综述，系统分析可信度在不同研究领域中的定义、操作化和应用方式，重点关注概念化方法、测量方法、验证技术、应用领域和基础价值观。

Result: 研究发现虽然透明度、问责制和鲁棒性等技术属性的定义取得了显著进展，但当前研究往往过度强调技术精度而牺牲社会伦理考量，AI系统的社会技术性质探索不足，可信度成为由有权定义者塑造的争议概念。

Conclusion: 需要采用结合技术严谨性与社会、文化和制度考量的跨学科方法推进可信AI，为AI伦理社区提出了采用真正解决AI系统与社会复杂互动的整体框架的行动措施。

Abstract: Background: Trustworthy AI serves as a foundational pillar for two major AI
ethics conferences: AIES and FAccT. However, current research often adopts
techno-centric approaches, focusing primarily on technical attributes such as
reliability, robustness, and fairness, while overlooking the sociotechnical
dimensions critical to understanding AI trustworthiness in real-world contexts.
  Objectives: This scoping review aims to examine how the AIES and FAccT
communities conceptualize, measure, and validate AI trustworthiness,
identifying major gaps and opportunities for advancing a holistic understanding
of trustworthy AI systems.
  Methods: We conduct a scoping review of AIES and FAccT conference proceedings
to date, systematically analyzing how trustworthiness is defined,
operationalized, and applied across different research domains. Our analysis
focuses on conceptualization approaches, measurement methods, verification and
validation techniques, application areas, and underlying values.
  Results: While significant progress has been made in defining technical
attributes such as transparency, accountability, and robustness, our findings
reveal critical gaps. Current research often predominantly emphasizes technical
precision at the expense of social and ethical considerations. The
sociotechnical nature of AI systems remains less explored and trustworthiness
emerges as a contested concept shaped by those with the power to define it.
  Conclusions: An interdisciplinary approach combining technical rigor with
social, cultural, and institutional considerations is essential for advancing
trustworthy AI. We propose actionable measures for the AI ethics community to
adopt holistic frameworks that genuinely address the complex interplay between
AI systems and society, ultimately promoting responsible technological
development that benefits all stakeholders.

### [94] [Learning Neural Control Barrier Functions from Expert Demonstrations using Inverse Constraint Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21560)
*Yuxuan Yang,Hussein Sibai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种基于演示学习的神经控制屏障函数方法，用于在故障集难以明确定义的情况下确保自主系统的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在关键领域运行的自主系统中，安全是基本要求。传统控制屏障函数需要明确指定故障集，但在许多实际场景中（如自动驾驶中的跟车问题），故障集难以形式化定义，而专家演示数据更容易获得。

Method: 使用演示学习训练约束函数来分类系统状态（安全/不安全），然后用该函数标注新的模拟轨迹来训练神经控制屏障函数。

Result: 在四个不同环境中进行实证评估，该方法优于现有基线方法，且与使用真实安全标签训练的神经控制屏障函数性能相当。

Conclusion: 该方法为在故障集难以明确定义的情况下设计安全滤波器提供了有效的数据驱动解决方案。

Abstract: Safety is a fundamental requirement for autonomous systems operating in
critical domains. Control barrier functions (CBFs) have been used to design
safety filters that minimally alter nominal controls for such systems to
maintain their safety. Learning neural CBFs has been proposed as a data-driven
alternative for their computationally expensive optimization-based synthesis.
However, it is often the case that the failure set of states that should be
avoided is non-obvious or hard to specify formally, e.g., tailgating in
autonomous driving, while a set of expert demonstrations that achieve the task
and avoid the failure set is easier to generate. We use ICL to train a
constraint function that classifies the states of the system under
consideration to safe, i.e., belong to a controlled forward invariant set that
is disjoint from the unspecified failure set, and unsafe ones, i.e., belong to
the complement of that set. We then use that function to label a new set of
simulated trajectories to train our neural CBF. We empirically evaluate our
approach in four different environments, demonstrating that it outperforms
existing baselines and achieves comparable performance to a neural CBF trained
with the same data but annotated with ground-truth safety labels.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CXRAgent是一个基于LLM的胸部X光分析智能体，通过导演编排的多阶段框架，整合工具调用、诊断规划和协作决策，提供可视化证据支持的可信诊断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CXR分析模型难以适应新诊断任务和复杂推理场景，且缺乏工具可靠性评估机制，限制了适应性和可信度。

Method: 采用导演编排的三阶段框架：工具调用（含证据驱动验证器）、诊断规划（组建专家团队）、协作决策（整合上下文记忆）。

Result: 在多种CXR解读任务上表现优异，能提供视觉证据，并良好泛化到不同复杂度的临床任务。

Conclusion: CXRAgent通过多阶段协作框架显著提升了CXR分析的适应性、可信度和推理能力。

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) plays a pivotal role in clinical diagnosis, and a variety
of task-specific and foundation models have been developed for automatic CXR
interpretation. However, these models often struggle to adapt to new diagnostic
tasks and complex reasoning scenarios. Recently, LLM-based agent models have
emerged as a promising paradigm for CXR analysis, enhancing model's capability
through tool coordination, multi-step reasoning, and team collaboration, etc.
However, existing agents often rely on a single diagnostic pipeline and lack
mechanisms for assessing tools' reliability, limiting their adaptability and
credibility. To this end, we propose CXRAgent, a director-orchestrated,
multi-stage agent for CXR interpretation, where a central director coordinates
the following stages: (1) Tool Invocation: The agent strategically orchestrates
a set of CXR-analysis tools, with outputs normalized and verified by the
Evidence-driven Validator (EDV), which grounds diagnostic outputs with visual
evidence to support reliable downstream diagnosis; (2) Diagnostic Planning:
Guided by task requirements and intermediate findings, the agent formulates a
targeted diagnostic plan. It then assembles an expert team accordingly,
defining member roles and coordinating their interactions to enable adaptive
and collaborative reasoning; (3) Collaborative Decision-making: The agent
integrates insights from the expert team with accumulated contextual memories,
synthesizing them into an evidence-backed diagnostic conclusion. Experiments on
various CXR interpretation tasks show that CXRAgent delivers strong
performance, providing visual evidence and generalizes well to clinical tasks
of different complexity. Code and data are valuable at this

*Lufan Chang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Magellan框架通过蒙特卡洛树搜索和分层引导系统，解决了LLMs在生成创新想法时依赖高概率常见概念的问题，显著提升了科学想法的可信度和创新性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在生成创新想法时往往陷入训练数据中的常见概念，现有方法如ToT依赖不可靠的自评估启发式方法，限制了探索效果。

Method: 使用蒙特卡洛树搜索，结合语义罗盘向量进行长程引导，以及基于景观感知的价值函数进行局部决策，平衡内在一致性、外在新颖性和叙事进展。

Result: 在广泛实验中，Magellan显著优于ReAct和ToT等基线方法，在科学想法生成方面表现出更高的可信度和创新性。

Conclusion: 对于创造性发现，有原则的引导搜索比无约束的自主性更有效，为LLMs成为创新合作伙伴铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with generating truly innovative
ideas, typically defaulting to high-probability, familiar concepts within their
training data's "gravity wells." While advanced search-based methods like Tree
of Thoughts (ToT) attempt to mitigate this, they are fundamentally limited by
their reliance on unprincipled, inconsistent self-evaluation heuristics to
guide exploration. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{Magellan}, a novel
framework that reframes creative generation as a principled, guided exploration
of an LLM's latent conceptual space. At its core, Magellan employs Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) governed by a hierarchical guidance system. For long-range
direction, a "semantic compass" vector, formulated via orthogonal projection,
steers the search towards relevant novelty. For local, step-by-step decisions,
a landscape-aware value function replaces flawed self-evaluation with an
explicit reward structure that balances intrinsic coherence, extrinsic novelty,
and narrative progress. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Magellan
significantly outperforms strong baselines, including ReAct and ToT, in
generating scientific ideas with superior plausibility and innovation. Our work
shows that for creative discovery, a principled, guided search is more
effective than unconstrained agency, paving the way for LLMs to become more
capable partners in innovation.

### [97] [Boosting Accuracy and Efficiency of Budget Forcing in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning for Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21398)
*Ravindra Aribowo Tarunokusumo,Rafael Fernandes Cunha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出结合强化学习的框架，在1.5B模型上提升数学推理性能，相比纯SFT方法在GSM8K数据集上准确率更高且token使用减少40%以上


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决预算强制方法依赖长上下文推理轨迹的监督微调导致小模型性能下降的问题，通过强化学习提高token效率

Method: 集成强化学习框架，仅使用1.5K训练样本，结合SFT+RL方法优化1.5B模型的数学推理能力

Result: 在GSM8K数据集上，SFT+RL模型在不同计算预算下表现更好，准确率更高且token使用减少超过40%

Conclusion: 强化学习可以恢复长上下文训练带来的损失，显著提升数学推理性能，同时提高token效率

Abstract: Test-time scaling methods have seen a rapid increase in popularity for its
computational efficiency and parameter-independent training to improve
reasoning performance on Large Language Models. One such method is called
budget forcing, a decoding intervention strategy which allocates extra compute
budget for thinking and elicits the inherent self-correcting behavior of the
model. However, this relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on long-context
reasoning traces which causes performance degradation on smaller models due to
verbose responses. For this reason, we offer a framework integrating
reinforcement learning (RL) to improve token efficiency and boost the
performance of a 1.5B model for mathematical reasoning. We demonstrate this
using only 1.5K training samples and found that our SFT+RL model performed
better on the GSM8K dataset with varying compute budgets. Our main findings
showed an overall higher accuracy while significantly reducing its token usage
by over 40% compared to the SFT model, revealing how RL can recover the losses
due to long-context training and altogether improving performance in
mathematical reasoning.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的分类框架，用于系统化理解符号AI如何有效集成到大型语言模型中，以解决LLM的透明度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在关键领域表现出色但缺乏透明度，现有神经符号AI方法主要针对传统神经网络，不适用于LLMs的独特特性，需要系统化的符号集成方法。

Method: 首先回顾已建立的神经符号AI方法，然后提出LLM中符号集成的新分类法，包括四个维度：LLM不同阶段的符号集成、耦合机制、架构范式以及算法和应用层面视角。

Result: 构建了一个新的分类框架，组织现有文献，识别当前基准、前沿进展和关键差距，为未来研究提出路线图。

Conclusion: 通过突出最新发展和文献中的显著差距，为实施符号集成框架以增强LLM透明度提供了实用见解。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated highly effective learning, human-like response
generation,and decision-making capabilities in high-risk sectors. However,
these models remain black boxes because they struggle to ensure transparency in
responses. The literature has explored numerous approaches to address
transparency challenges in LLMs, including Neurosymbolic AI (NeSy AI). NeSy AI
approaches were primarily developed for conventional neural networks and are
not well-suited to the unique features of LLMs. Consequently, there is a
limited systematic understanding of how symbolic AI can be effectively
integrated into LLMs. This paper aims to address this gap by first reviewing
established NeSy AI methods and then proposing a novel taxonomy of symbolic
integration in LLMs, along with a roadmap to merge symbolic techniques with
LLMs. The roadmap introduces a new categorisation framework across four
dimensions by organising existing literature within these categories. These
include symbolic integration across various stages of LLM, coupling mechanisms,
architectural paradigms, as well as algorithmic and application-level
perspectives. The paper thoroughly identifies current benchmarks, cutting-edge
advancements, and critical gaps within the field to propose a roadmap for
future research. By highlighting the latest developments and notable gaps in
the literature, it offers practical insights for implementing frameworks for
symbolic integration into LLMs to enhance transparency.

TL;DR: AutoOpt-11k是一个包含11,000多个手写和打印数学优化模型图像的数据集，以及AutoOpt框架——一个基于机器学习的自动化优化问题求解系统，用户只需提供优化公式图像即可自动求解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决数学优化问题求解过程中需要人工建模和编程的繁琐过程，开发一个完全自动化的优化问题求解框架。

Method: AutoOpt框架包含三个模块：M1使用深度学习模型进行数学表达式识别生成LaTeX代码；M2使用微调的小型LLM将LaTeX转换为PYOMO脚本；M3使用双层优化分解方法求解优化问题。

Result: MER任务的深度学习模型在BLEU分数上优于ChatGPT、Gemini和Nougat；BOBD方法在复杂测试问题上比内点算法和遗传算法表现更好。

Conclusion: AutoOpt框架能够有效自动化优化问题的求解过程，在数学表达式识别和复杂问题求解方面都表现出优越性能。

Abstract: This study presents AutoOpt-11k, a unique image dataset of over 11,000
handwritten and printed mathematical optimization models corresponding to
single-objective, multi-objective, multi-level, and stochastic optimization
problems exhibiting various types of complexities such as non-linearity,
non-convexity, non-differentiability, discontinuity, and high-dimensionality.
The labels consist of the LaTeX representation for all the images and modeling
language representation for a subset of images. The dataset is created by 25
experts following ethical data creation guidelines and verified in two-phases
to avoid errors. Further, we develop AutoOpt framework, a machine learning
based automated approach for solving optimization problems, where the user just
needs to provide an image of the formulation and AutoOpt solves it efficiently
without any further human intervention. AutoOpt framework consists of three
Modules: (i) M1 (Image_to_Text)- a deep learning model performs the
Mathematical Expression Recognition (MER) task to generate the LaTeX code
corresponding to the optimization formulation in image; (ii) M2 (Text_to_Text)-
a small-scale fine-tuned LLM generates the PYOMO script (optimization modeling
language) from LaTeX code; (iii) M3 (Optimization)- a Bilevel Optimization
based Decomposition (BOBD) method solves the optimization formulation described
in the PYOMO script. We use AutoOpt-11k dataset for training and testing of
deep learning models employed in AutoOpt. The deep learning model for MER task
(M1) outperforms ChatGPT, Gemini and Nougat on BLEU score metric. BOBD method
(M3), which is a hybrid approach, yields better results on complex test
problems compared to common approaches, like interior-point algorithm and
genetic algorithm.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个框架，通过重用基础求解器来增强统一求解器对VRP变体共享组件特性的感知能力，同时避免神经求解器数量的指数增长。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多任务VRP神经方法通常学习统一求解器来同时处理多个约束，但未能充分利用VRP变体的组合结构，每个变体都可以从一组基础VRP变体中推导出来。

Method: 引入状态可分解MDP（SDMDP），将状态空间表示为与基础VRP变体相关的基础状态空间的笛卡尔积。开发了基于潜在空间的SDMDP扩展，结合最优基础策略和可学习的混合函数，在潜在空间中实现策略重用。

Result: 在多个VRP变体上进行的广泛实验表明，MoSES优于先前的方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架通过重用基础求解器，有效提升了统一求解器对VRP变体共享组件特性的感知能力，并在实验中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Existing neural methods for multi-task vehicle routing problems (VRPs)
typically learn unified solvers to handle multiple constraints simultaneously.
However, they often underutilize the compositional structure of VRP variants,
each derivable from a common set of basis VRP variants. This critical oversight
causes unified solvers to miss out the potential benefits of basis solvers,
each specialized for a basis VRP variant. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a framework that enables unified solvers to perceive the
shared-component nature across VRP variants by proactively reusing basis
solvers, while mitigating the exponential growth of trained neural solvers.
Specifically, we introduce a State-Decomposable MDP (SDMDP) that reformulates
VRPs by expressing the state space as the Cartesian product of basis state
spaces associated with basis VRP variants. More crucially, this formulation
inherently yields the optimal basis policy for each basis VRP variant.
Furthermore, a Latent Space-based SDMDP extension is developed by incorporating
both the optimal basis policies and a learnable mixture function to enable the
policy reuse in the latent space. Under mild assumptions, this extension
provably recovers the optimal unified policy of SDMDP through the mixture
function that computes the state embedding as a mapping from the basis state
embeddings generated by optimal basis policies. For practical implementation,
we introduce the Mixture-of-Specialized-Experts Solver (MoSES), which realizes
basis policies through specialized Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) experts, and
implements the mixture function via an adaptive gating mechanism. Extensive
experiments conducted across VRP variants showcase the superiority of MoSES
over prior methods.

TL;DR: EU-Agent-Bench是一个评估LLM代理在欧盟法律框架下合规性的基准测试，通过人类策划的场景测试代理是否会在看似良性的用户请求下采取非法行动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM代理在各种环境中部署，它们可能表现出不可预测的行为，包括采取不理想和/或不安全的行动。需要测量LLM代理在欧盟立法背景下采取非法行动的潜在倾向。

Method: 创建了一个可验证的人类策划基准，涵盖数据保护、偏见/歧视和科学诚信等多个类别场景。通过将模型的函数调用与详尽引用相关立法的评分标准进行比较来评估法律合规性。

Result: 评估了前沿LLM的法律合规性，并研究了在代理系统提示中提供相关立法摘录和明确合规指令对合规性的影响。

Conclusion: 发布了公开预览集供研究社区使用，同时保留私有测试集以防止数据污染。鼓励未来工作将代理安全基准扩展到不同法律管辖区以及多轮和多语言交互。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents in various
contexts by providing tools at their disposal. However, LLM agents can exhibit
unpredictable behaviors, including taking undesirable and/or unsafe actions. In
order to measure the latent propensity of LLM agents for taking illegal actions
under an EU legislative context, we introduce EU-Agent-Bench, a verifiable
human-curated benchmark that evaluates an agent's alignment with EU legal norms
in situations where benign user inputs could lead to unlawful actions. Our
benchmark spans scenarios across several categories, including data protection,
bias/discrimination, and scientific integrity, with each user request allowing
for both compliant and non-compliant execution of the requested actions.
Comparing the model's function calls against a rubric exhaustively supported by
citations of the relevant legislature, we evaluate the legal compliance of
frontier LLMs, and furthermore investigate the compliance effect of providing
the relevant legislative excerpts in the agent's system prompt along with
explicit instructions to comply. We release a public preview set for the
research community, while holding out a private test set to prevent data
contamination in evaluating upcoming models. We encourage future work extending
agentic safety benchmarks to different legal jurisdictions and to multi-turn
and multilingual interactions. We release our code on

TL;DR: Co-Sight通过冲突感知元验证和可信推理结构化事实机制，将推理转化为可证伪和可审计的过程，解决了LLM智能体长程推理中的验证不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM智能体的长程推理失败往往不是由于生成能力不足，而是因为中间推理过程缺乏充分验证。

Method: 采用冲突感知元验证和可信推理结构化事实两种互补机制：CAMV将验证重构为冲突识别和针对性证伪，TRSF持续组织、验证和同步证据。

Result: 在GAIA上达到84.4%的准确率，Humanity's Last Exam上达到35.5%，Chinese-SimpleQA上达到93.8%，均达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: Co-Sight为LLM智能体的可靠长程推理提供了一个可扩展的范式，结构化事实基础和冲突感知验证的协同作用驱动了性能提升。

Abstract: Long-horizon reasoning in LLM-based agents often fails not from generative
weakness but from insufficient verification of intermediate reasoning. Co-Sight
addresses this challenge by turning reasoning into a falsifiable and auditable
process through two complementary mechanisms: Conflict-Aware Meta-Verification
(CAMV) and Trustworthy Reasoning with Structured Facts (TRSF). CAMV
reformulates verification as conflict identification and targeted
falsification, allocating computation only to disagreement hotspots among
expert agents rather than to full reasoning chains. This bounds verification
cost to the number of inconsistencies and improves efficiency and reliability.
TRSF continuously organizes, validates, and synchronizes evidence across agents
through a structured facts module. By maintaining verified, traceable, and
auditable knowledge, it ensures that all reasoning is grounded in consistent,
source-verified information and supports transparent verification throughout
the reasoning process. Together, TRSF and CAMV form a closed verification loop,
where TRSF supplies structured facts and CAMV selectively falsifies or
reinforces them, yielding transparent and trustworthy reasoning. Empirically,
Co-Sight achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on GAIA (84.4%) and Humanity's Last
Exam (35.5%), and strong results on Chinese-SimpleQA (93.8%). Ablation studies
confirm that the synergy between structured factual grounding and
conflict-aware verification drives these improvements. Co-Sight thus offers a
scalable paradigm for reliable long-horizon reasoning in LLM-based agents. Code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有编码代理的自我改进方法依赖于软件工程基准性能，但作者发现代理的自我改进潜力(metaproductivity)与其编码基准性能之间存在不匹配问题。

Method: 提出CMP指标来评估代理的自我改进潜力，并基于此构建Huxley-Gödel Machine (HGM)，通过估计CMP来指导自我修改树的搜索过程。

Result: 在SWE-bench Verified和Polyglot基准测试中，HGM优于之前的自我改进编码代理开发方法，同时使用更少的实际时间，并在其他编码数据集和大型语言模型上表现出良好的迁移性。

Conclusion: HGM方法通过正确评估代理的自我改进潜力，实现了更有效的自我改进过程，达到了人类水平的编码代理性能。

Abstract: Recent studies operationalize self-improvement through coding agents that
edit their own codebases. They grow a tree of self-modifications through
expansion strategies that favor higher software engineering benchmark
performance, assuming that this implies more promising subsequent
self-modifications. However, we identify a mismatch between the agent's
self-improvement potential (metaproductivity) and its coding benchmark
performance, namely the Metaproductivity-Performance Mismatch. Inspired by
Huxley's concept of clade, we propose a metric ($\mathrm{CMP}$) that aggregates
the benchmark performances of the descendants of an agent as an indicator of
its potential for self-improvement. We show that, in our self-improving coding
agent development setting, access to the true $\mathrm{CMP}$ is sufficient to
simulate how the G\"odel Machine would behave under certain assumptions. We
introduce the Huxley-G\"odel Machine (HGM), which, by estimating $\mathrm{CMP}$
and using it as guidance, searches the tree of self-modifications. On SWE-bench
Verified and Polyglot, HGM outperforms prior self-improving coding agent
development methods while using less wall-clock time. Last but not least, HGM
demonstrates strong transfer to other coding datasets and large language
models. The agent optimized by HGM on SWE-bench Verified with GPT-5-mini and
evaluated on SWE-bench Lite with GPT-5 achieves human-level performance,
matching the best officially checked results of human-engineered coding agents.

Abstract: Large reasoning models have demonstrated strong problem-solving abilities,
yet real-world tasks often require external tools and long-horizon
interactions. Existing agent frameworks typically follow predefined workflows,
which limit autonomous and global task completion. In this paper, we introduce
DeepAgent, an end-to-end deep reasoning agent that performs autonomous
thinking, tool discovery, and action execution within a single, coherent
reasoning process. To address the challenges of long-horizon interactions,
particularly the context length explosion from multiple tool calls and the
accumulation of interaction history, we introduce an autonomous memory folding
mechanism that compresses past interactions into structured episodic, working,
and tool memories, reducing error accumulation while preserving critical
information. To teach general-purpose tool use efficiently and stably, we
develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning strategy, namely ToolPO, that
leverages LLM-simulated APIs and applies tool-call advantage attribution to
assign fine-grained credit to the tool invocation tokens. Extensive experiments
on eight benchmarks, including general tool-use tasks (ToolBench, API-Bank,
TMDB, Spotify, ToolHop) and downstream applications (ALFWorld, WebShop, GAIA,
HLE), demonstrate that DeepAgent consistently outperforms baselines across both
labeled-tool and open-set tool retrieval scenarios. This work takes a step
toward more general and capable agents for real-world applications. The code

Conclusion: 需要更严格的基准来评估AI科学代理，AstaBench提供了这样的框架，但当前AI在科学辅助方面的能力仍然有限。

Abstract: AI agents hold the potential to revolutionize scientific productivity by
automating literature reviews, replicating experiments, analyzing data, and
even proposing new directions of inquiry; indeed, there are now many such
agents, ranging from general-purpose "deep research" systems to specialized
science-specific agents, such as AI Scientist and AIGS. Rigorous evaluation of
these agents is critical for progress. Yet existing benchmarks fall short on
several fronts: they (1) fail to provide holistic, product-informed measures of
real-world use cases such as science research; (2) lack reproducible agent
tools necessary for a controlled comparison of core agentic capabilities; (3)
do not account for confounding variables such as model cost and tool access;
(4) do not provide standardized interfaces for quick agent prototyping and
evaluation; and (5) lack comprehensive baseline agents necessary to identify
true advances. In response, we define principles and tooling for more
rigorously benchmarking agents. Using these, we present AstaBench, a suite that
provides the first holistic measure of agentic ability to perform scientific
research, comprising 2400+ problems spanning the entire scientific discovery
process and multiple scientific domains, and including many problems inspired
by actual user requests to deployed Asta agents. Our suite comes with the first
scientific research environment with production-grade search tools that enable
controlled, reproducible evaluation, better accounting for confounders.
Alongside, we provide a comprehensive suite of nine science-optimized classes
of Asta agents and numerous baselines. Our extensive evaluation of 57 agents
across 22 agent classes reveals several interesting findings, most importantly
that despite meaningful progress on certain individual aspects, AI remains far
from solving the challenge of science research assistance.

### [106] [CMOMgen: Complex Multi-Ontology Alignment via Pattern-Guided In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21656)
*Marta Contreiras Silva,Daniel Faria,Catia Pesquita*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CMOMgen是首个端到端的复杂多本体匹配策略，能够生成完整且语义合理的映射，无需限制目标本体或实体的数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建全面的知识图谱需要使用多个本体来将数据完全情境化到特定领域。简单的成对等价映射无法提供相关但不相交本体的完整语义集成，需要更复杂的多本体匹配方法。

Method: 使用检索增强生成技术选择相关类别来组成映射，并过滤匹配的参考映射作为示例来增强上下文学习。

Result: 在三个生物医学任务中，CMOMgen在类别选择方面优于基线方法，F1分数最低达到63%，在两个任务中优于所有基线和消融版本，在第三个任务中排名第二。手动评估显示46%的非参考映射获得最高分。

Conclusion: CMOMgen能够构建语义合理的映射，证明了专用策略在复杂多本体匹配中的有效性。

Abstract: Constructing comprehensive knowledge graphs requires the use of multiple
ontologies in order to fully contextualize data into a domain. Ontology
matching finds equivalences between concepts interconnecting ontologies and
creating a cohesive semantic layer. While the simple pairwise state of the art
is well established, simple equivalence mappings cannot provide full semantic
integration of related but disjoint ontologies. Complex multi-ontology matching
(CMOM) aligns one source entity to composite logical expressions of multiple
target entities, establishing more nuanced equivalences and provenance along
the ontological hierarchy.
  We present CMOMgen, the first end-to-end CMOM strategy that generates
complete and semantically sound mappings, without establishing any restrictions
on the number of target ontologies or entities. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
selects relevant classes to compose the mapping and filters matching reference
mappings to serve as examples, enhancing In-Context Learning. The strategy was
evaluated in three biomedical tasks with partial reference alignments. CMOMgen
outperforms baselines in class selection, demonstrating the impact of having a
dedicated strategy. Our strategy also achieves a minimum of 63% in F1-score,
outperforming all baselines and ablated versions in two out of three tasks and
placing second in the third. Furthermore, a manual evaluation of non-reference
mappings showed that 46% of the mappings achieve the maximum score, further
substantiating its ability to construct semantically sound mappings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于评估视觉语言模型的专家标注视频广告数据集，专门分析能源公司的公关框架，特别是绿色创新等13种框架类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公司公关活动存在言行不一的问题（如石油公司的"漂绿"现象），需要大规模理解公关活动的框架变化和本质。

Method: 构建了从Facebook和YouTube获取的专家标注视频广告数据集，涵盖50多家公司和20个国家，标注了13种框架类型，专门用于视觉语言模型评估。

Result: 基线实验显示GPT-4.1在检测环境信息方面达到79% F1分数，但最佳模型在识别绿色创新框架方面仅达到46% F1分数。

Conclusion: 该数据集有助于能源领域战略沟通的多模态分析研究，同时揭示了视觉语言模型在处理隐性框架、不同长度视频和隐性文化背景等方面的挑战。

Abstract: Companies spend large amounts of money on public relations campaigns to
project a positive brand image. However, sometimes there is a mismatch between
what they say and what they do. Oil & gas companies, for example, are accused
of "greenwashing" with imagery of climate-friendly initiatives. Understanding
the framing, and changes in framing, at scale can help better understand the
goals and nature of public relations campaigns. To address this, we introduce a
benchmark dataset of expert-annotated video ads obtained from Facebook and
YouTube. The dataset provides annotations for 13 framing types for more than 50
companies or advocacy groups across 20 countries. Our dataset is especially
designed for the evaluation of vision-language models (VLMs), distinguishing it
from past text-only framing datasets. Baseline experiments show some promising
results, while leaving room for improvement for future work: GPT-4.1 can detect
environmental messages with 79% F1 score, while our best model only achieves
46% F1 score on identifying framing around green innovation. We also identify
challenges that VLMs must address, such as implicit framing, handling videos of
various lengths, or implicit cultural backgrounds. Our dataset contributes to
research in multimodal analysis of strategic communication in the energy
sector.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于知识图谱的框架，用于弥合自主代理在动态环境中高层任务目标与低层规划器输入之间的语义鸿沟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自主代理在动态环境中协调时，高层任务目标与低层规划器输入之间的语义鸿沟问题。

Method: 引入以知识图谱为中心的框架，采用双平面架构将声明性事实编译为每个代理的任务感知"世界观"和物理感知遍历规则，将任务语义与领域无关的规划器解耦。

Result: 通过墨西哥湾自主水下航行器的案例研究，可视化展示了端到端过程，并定量证明不同声明性策略能产生不同的高性能结果。

Conclusion: 该工作确立了知识图谱不仅是数据存储库，更是创建自适应和可解释自主系统的强大、有状态编排器。

Abstract: The coordination of autonomous agents in dynamic environments is hampered by
the semantic gap between high-level mission objectives and low-level planner
inputs. To address this, we introduce a framework centered on a Knowledge Graph
(KG) that functions as an intelligent translation layer. The KG's two-plane
architecture compiles declarative facts into per-agent, mission-aware
``worldviews" and physics-aware traversal rules, decoupling mission semantics
from a domain-agnostic planner. This allows complex, coordinated paths to be
modified simply by changing facts in the KG. A case study involving Autonomous
Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) in the Gulf of Mexico visually demonstrates the
end-to-end process and quantitatively proves that different declarative
policies produce distinct, high-performing outcomes. This work establishes the
KG not merely as a data repository, but as a powerful, stateful orchestrator
for creating adaptive and explainable autonomous systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据驱动方法在建模复杂材料时面临泛化性差和物理一致性不足的挑战，需要开发能够跨物理场景泛化并保持物理一致性的方法。

Method: 使用两个独立的神经网络分别建模弹性和塑性本构定律，将物理参数作为条件输入，在包含多种场景的综合数据集上训练，实现无需重新训练即可泛化到不同属性。

Result: 实验结果显示在运动重建、鲁棒长期预测、几何泛化和精确参数估计方面达到最先进性能，证明了其作为统一模拟器和逆向分析工具的通用性。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了数据驱动方法在材料建模中的泛化性和物理一致性问题，为弹塑性材料提供了有效的正向模拟和逆向分析能力。

Abstract: While data-driven methods offer significant promise for modeling complex
materials, they often face challenges in generalizing across diverse physical
scenarios and maintaining physical consistency. To address these limitations,
we propose a generalizable framework called Physics-Embedded Conditional Neural
Constitutive Laws for Elastoplastic Materials, which combines the partial
differential equations with neural networks. Specifically, the model employs
two separate neural networks to model elastic and plastic constitutive laws.
Simultaneously, the model incorporates physical parameters as conditional
inputs and is trained on comprehensive datasets encompassing multiple scenarios
with varying physical parameters, thereby enabling generalization across
different properties without requiring retraining for each individual case.
Furthermore, the differentiable architecture of our model, combined with its
explicit parameter inputs, enables the inverse estimation of physical
parameters from observed motion sequences. This capability extends our
framework to objects with unknown or unmeasured properties. Experimental
results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in motion reconstruction,
robust long-term prediction, geometry generalization, and precise parameters
estimation for elastoplastic materials, highlighting its versatility as a
unified simulator and inverse analysis tool.

TL;DR: ROPES是一个基于分数因果表示学习的无监督机器人姿态估计框架，通过利用机器人自然干预来识别可控的潜在变量，无需标注数据即可高保真地解耦生成因子。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弥合因果表示学习理论与实际应用之间的差距，将CRL应用于机器人领域，特别是机器人姿态估计问题。

Method: 提出ROPES框架，利用机器人执行器命令产生的自然干预，通过分数因果表示学习识别可控的潜在变量，仅使用分布变化而不依赖标注数据。

Result: 在半合成机械臂实验中，ROPES成功以高保真度解耦了潜在生成因子，与真实值高度一致。

Conclusion: 机器人姿态估计可以作为因果表示学习的接近实用的测试平台，展示了无监督CRL在现实世界应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Causal representation learning (CRL) has emerged as a powerful unsupervised
framework that (i) disentangles the latent generative factors underlying
high-dimensional data, and (ii) learns the cause-and-effect interactions among
the disentangled variables. Despite extensive recent advances in
identifiability and some practical progress, a substantial gap remains between
theory and real-world practice. This paper takes a step toward closing that gap
by bringing CRL to robotics, a domain that has motivated CRL. Specifically,
this paper addresses the well-defined robot pose estimation -- the recovery of
position and orientation from raw images -- by introducing Robotic Pose
Estimation via Score-Based CRL (ROPES). Being an unsupervised framework, ROPES
embodies the essence of interventional CRL by identifying those generative
factors that are actuated: images are generated by intrinsic and extrinsic
latent factors (e.g., joint angles, arm/limb geometry, lighting, background,
and camera configuration) and the objective is to disentangle and recover the
controllable latent variables, i.e., those that can be directly manipulated
(intervened upon) through actuation. Interventional CRL theory shows that
variables that undergo variations via interventions can be identified. In
robotics, such interventions arise naturally by commanding actuators of various
joints and recording images under varied controls. Empirical evaluations in
semi-synthetic manipulator experiments demonstrate that ROPES successfully
disentangles latent generative factors with high fidelity with respect to the
ground truth. Crucially, this is achieved by leveraging only distributional
changes, without using any labeled data. The paper also includes a comparison
with a baseline based on a recently proposed semi-supervised framework. This
paper concludes by positioning robot pose estimation as a near-practical
testbed for CRL.

overview of these challenges and solutions with an emphasis on those that have
been put through a rigorous validation process and accepted by regulatory
bodies. The challenges posed by the collision avoidance problem are often
present in other domains, and aircraft collision avoidance systems can serve as
case studies that provide valuable insights for a wide range of safety-critical

Abstract: Robotic suturing is a prototypical long-horizon dexterous manipulation task,
requiring coordinated needle grasping, precise tissue penetration, and secure
knot tying. Despite numerous efforts toward end-to-end autonomy, a fully
autonomous suturing pipeline has yet to be demonstrated on physical hardware.
We introduce SutureBot: an autonomous suturing benchmark on the da Vinci
Research Kit (dVRK), spanning needle pickup, tissue insertion, and knot tying.
To ensure repeatability, we release a high-fidelity dataset comprising 1,890
suturing demonstrations. Furthermore, we propose a goal-conditioned framework
that explicitly optimizes insertion-point precision, improving targeting
accuracy by 59\%-74\% over a task-only baseline. To establish this task as a
benchmark for dexterous imitation learning, we evaluate state-of-the-art
vision-language-action (VLA) models, including $\pi_0$, GR00T N1, OpenVLA-OFT,
and multitask ACT, each augmented with a high-level task-prediction policy.
Autonomous suturing is a key milestone toward achieving robotic autonomy in
surgery. These contributions support reproducible evaluation and development of
precision-focused, long-horizon dexterous manipulation policies necessary for
end-to-end suturing. Dataset is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于视觉输入的强化学习对光照、颜色、视角等分布外变化很脆弱，点云强化学习虽然缓解了外观脆弱性，但对相机姿态失配仍然敏感，影响实际应用可靠性。

Method: 提出PCA点云（PPC）框架，专门针对下游机器人控制设计，将任意刚性变换的点云映射到唯一的规范姿态，使观测对齐到一致坐标系。

Result: 实验表明PPC在具有挑战性的机器人任务中提高了对未见相机姿态的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PPC为领域随机化提供了原则性替代方案，通过规范姿态映射显著减少视角引起的不一致性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) from raw visual input has achieved impressive
successes in recent years, yet it remains fragile to out-of-distribution
variations such as changes in lighting, color, and viewpoint. Point Cloud
Reinforcement Learning (PC-RL) offers a promising alternative by mitigating
appearance-based brittleness, but its sensitivity to camera pose mismatches
continues to undermine reliability in realistic settings. To address this
challenge, we propose PCA Point Cloud (PPC), a canonicalization framework
specifically tailored for downstream robotic control. PPC maps point clouds
under arbitrary rigid-body transformations to a unique canonical pose, aligning
observations to a consistent frame, thereby substantially decreasing
viewpoint-induced inconsistencies. In our experiments, we show that PPC
improves robustness to unseen camera poses across challenging robotic tasks,
providing a principled alternative to domain randomization.

Abstract: We introduce a novel system for human-to-robot trajectory transfer that
enables robots to manipulate objects by learning from human demonstration
videos. The system consists of four modules. The first module is a data
collection module that is designed to collect human demonstration videos from
the point of view of a robot using an AR headset. The second module is a video
understanding module that detects objects and extracts 3D human-hand
trajectories from demonstration videos. The third module transfers a human-hand
trajectory into a reference trajectory of a robot end-effector in 3D space. The
last module utilizes a trajectory optimization algorithm to solve a trajectory
in the robot configuration space that can follow the end-effector trajectory
transferred from the human demonstration. Consequently, these modules enable a
robot to watch a human demonstration video once and then repeat the same mobile
manipulation task in different environments, even when objects are placed
differently from the demonstrations. Experiments of different manipulation
tasks are conducted on a mobile manipulator to verify the effectiveness of our
system

Motivation: 从演示中学习虽然样本效率高，但教授包含多个技能的长期任务时存在偏差累积、分布偏移和教师疲劳等问题，导致失败率增加。

Method: 提出(ST)^2顺序学习方法，允许用户通过定义关键点来控制教学流程，支持增量结构化演示；通过用户研究比较传统整体演示与顺序分段演示两种框架。

Result: 在16名参与者的零售环境研究中，两种方法在轨迹质量和成功率上表现相似；主观偏好方面，部分用户喜欢顺序方法的迭代控制，部分用户偏好整体方法的简洁性。

Conclusion: 两种教学框架在性能上相当，但用户偏好不同，表明应根据具体应用场景和用户需求选择合适的教学策略。

Abstract: Learning from demonstration is effective for teaching robots complex skills
with high sample efficiency. However, teaching long-horizon tasks with multiple
skills is difficult, as deviations accumulate, distributional shift increases,
and human teachers become fatigued, raising the chance of failure. In this
work, we study user responses to two teaching frameworks: (i) a traditional
monolithic approach, where users demonstrate the entire trajectory of a
long-horizon task; and (ii) a sequential approach, where the task is segmented
by the user and demonstrations are provided step by step. To support this
study, we introduce $(ST)^2$, a sequential method for learning long-horizon
manipulation tasks that allows users to control the teaching flow by defining
key points, enabling incremental and structured demonstrations. We conducted a
user study on a restocking task with 16 participants in a realistic retail
environment to evaluate both user preference and method effectiveness. Our
objective and subjective results show that both methods achieve similar
trajectory quality and success rates. Some participants preferred the
sequential approach for its iterative control, while others favored the
monolithic approach for its simplicity.

TL;DR: 本文挑战了反应式重规划需要更新现有计划的传统假设，提出使用快速渐近最优规划算法作为一系列独立问题来更高效地解决增量规划问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统反应式规划方法在环境变化时需要更新密集的规划图，计算成本高且需要检测变化，这在实际应用中存在困难。

Method: 使用快速渐近最优规划算法（如Effort Informed Trees和Asymptotically Optimal RRT-Connect）作为一系列独立问题来解决增量规划，无需显式重用计划。

Result: 模拟实验显示EIT*找到的中位解路径比测试的反应式规划算法更短，并在真实机器人臂规划问题上通过AORRTC得到验证。

Conclusion: 反应式重规划可以通过独立问题序列更高效地实现，无需传统计划更新方法，在动态环境中表现更优。

Abstract: Robots operating in changing environments either predict obstacle changes
and/or plan quickly enough to react to them. Predictive approaches require a
strong prior about the position and motion of obstacles. Reactive approaches
require no assumptions about their environment but must replan quickly and find
high-quality paths to navigate effectively.
  Reactive approaches often reuse information between queries to reduce
planning cost. These techniques are conceptually sound but updating dense
planning graphs when information changes can be computationally prohibitive. It
can also require significant effort to detect the changes in some applications.
  This paper revisits the long-held assumption that reactive replanning
requires updating existing plans. It shows that the incremental planning
problem can alternatively be solved more efficiently as a series of independent
problems using fast almost-surely asymptotically optimal (ASAO) planning
algorithms. These ASAO algorithms quickly find an initial solution and converge
towards an optimal solution which allows them to find consistent global plans
in the presence of changing obstacles without requiring explicit plan reuse.
This is demonstrated with simulated experiments where Effort Informed Trees
(EIT*) finds shorter median solution paths than the tested reactive planning
algorithms and is further validated using Asymptotically Optimal RRT-Connect
(AORRTC) on a real-world planning problem on a robot arm.

Motivation: 解决机器人操作中策略泛化能力不足和样本效率低下的问题，特别是在面对新的空间排列、物体外观和任务组合时。

Method: 使用基础模型将演示分解为可迁移的对象规范化技能原语，在测试时将高层代理预测的技能-对象对映射回世界坐标系执行。

Result: 在仿真中，每个任务仅用3个演示训练的GSL比使用30倍数据的基线在未见任务上表现提升15.5%；在真实世界实验中，也优于使用10倍数据的基线。

Conclusion: GSL的结构化但灵活设计显著提高了样本效率和泛化能力，为机器人操作提供了有效的分层策略学习框架。

Abstract: We present Generalizable Hierarchical Skill Learning (GSL), a novel framework
for hierarchical policy learning that significantly improves policy
generalization and sample efficiency in robot manipulation. One core idea of
GSL is to use object-centric skills as an interface that bridges the high-level
vision-language model and the low-level visual-motor policy. Specifically, GSL
decomposes demonstrations into transferable and object-canonicalized skill
primitives using foundation models, ensuring efficient low-level skill learning
in the object frame. At test time, the skill-object pairs predicted by the
high-level agent are fed to the low-level module, where the inferred canonical
actions are mapped back to the world frame for execution. This structured yet
flexible design leads to substantial improvements in sample efficiency and
generalization of our method across unseen spatial arrangements, object
appearances, and task compositions. In simulation, GSL trained with only 3
demonstrations per task outperforms baselines trained with 30 times more data
by 15.5 percent on unseen tasks. In real-world experiments, GSL also surpasses
the baseline trained with 10 times more data.

Conclusion: 结果突出了我们机器人无关框架在恶劣条件下自主自组装和重构的灵活性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Modular robots offer reconfigurability and fault tolerance essential for
lunar missions, but require controllers that adapt safely to real-world
disturbances. We build on our previous hardware-agnostic actuator
synchronization in Motion Stack to develop a new controller enforcing adaptive
velocity bounds via a dynamic hypersphere clamp. Using only real-time
end-effector and target pose measurements, the controller adjusts its
translational and rotational speed limits to ensure smooth, stable alignment
without abrupt motions. We implemented two variants, a discrete, step-based
version and a continuous, velocity-based version, and tested them on two
MoonBot limbs in JAXA's lunar environment simulator. Field trials demonstrate
that the step-based variant produces highly predictable, low-wobble motions,
while the continuous variant converges more quickly and maintains
millimeter-level positional accuracy, and both remain robust across limbs with
differing mechanical imperfections and sensing noise (e.g., backlash and flex).
These results highlight the flexibility and robustness of our robot-agnostic
framework for autonomous self-assembly and reconfiguration under harsh
conditions.

Abstract: Visual degradation caused by limited visibility, insufficient lighting, and
feature scarcity in underwater environments presents significant challenges to
visual-inertial simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems. To
address these challenges, this paper proposes a graph-based
visual-inertial-acoustic-depth SLAM system that integrates a stereo camera, an
inertial measurement unit (IMU), the Doppler velocity log (DVL), and a pressure
sensor. The key innovation lies in the tight integration of four distinct
sensor modalities to ensure reliable operation, even under degraded visual
conditions. To mitigate DVL drift and improve measurement efficiency, we
propose a novel velocity-bias-based DVL preintegration strategy. At the
frontend, hybrid tracking strategies and acoustic-inertial-depth joint
optimization enhance system stability. Additionally, multi-source hybrid
residuals are incorporated into a graph optimization framework. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative analyses of the proposed system are conducted in
both simulated and real-world underwater scenarios. The results demonstrate
that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art stereo visual-inertial
SLAM systems in both stability and localization accuracy, exhibiting
exceptional robustness, particularly in visually challenging environments.

*Daniel Schleich,Jan Quenzel,Sven Behnke*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于消费级DJI无人机的自主飞行系统，通过Android应用实现状态估计和避障，支持单操作员同时监控多个异构无人机，并整合所有无人机观测数据构建联合3D环境模型。

Conclusion: 该系统证明了使用现成消费级无人机实现自主飞行的可行性，简化了多无人机系统的操作，为应急救援等应用提供了实用的自主飞行解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, consumer-grade UAVs have been widely adopted by first
responders. In general, they are operated manually, which requires trained
pilots, especially in unknown GNSS-denied environments and in the vicinity of
structures. Autonomous flight can facilitate the application of UAVs and reduce
operator strain. However, autonomous systems usually require special
programming interfaces, custom sensor setups, and strong onboard computers,
which limits a broader deployment.
  We present a system for autonomous flight using lightweight consumer-grade
DJI drones. They are controlled by an Android app for state estimation and
obstacle avoidance directly running on the UAV's remote control. Our ground
control station enables a single operator to configure and supervise multiple
heterogeneous UAVs at once. Furthermore, it combines the observations of all
UAVs into a joint 3D environment model for improved situational awareness.

Conclusion: 该框架为四足机器人在不稳定地形上的安全导航提供了有效解决方案，通过集成多种策略实现了鲁棒的运动控制。

Abstract: Collapsing terrains, often present in search and rescue missions or planetary
exploration, pose significant challenges for quadruped robots. This paper
introduces a robust locomotion framework for safe navigation over unstable
surfaces by integrating terrain probing, load-bearing analysis, motion
planning, and control strategies. Unlike traditional methods that rely on
specialized sensors or external terrain mapping alone, our approach leverages
joint measurements to assess terrain stability without hardware modifications.
A Model Predictive Control (MPC) system optimizes robot motion, balancing
stability and probing constraints, while a state machine coordinates terrain
probing actions, enabling the robot to detect collapsible regions and
dynamically adjust its footholds. Experimental results on custom-made
collapsing platforms and rocky terrains demonstrate the framework's ability to
traverse collapsing terrain while maintaining stability and prioritizing
safety.

Conclusion: PREVENT系统能够有效集成到现有软件架构中，为移动机器人化学家提供可靠的工作流异常检测和决策能力

Abstract: Mobile robotic chemists are a fast growing trend in the field of chemistry
and materials research. However, so far these mobile robots lack workflow
awareness skills. This poses the risk that even a small anomaly, such as an
improperly capped sample vial could disrupt the entire workflow. This wastes
time, and resources, and could pose risks to human researchers, such as
exposure to toxic materials. Existing perception mechanisms can be used to
predict anomalies but they often generate excessive false positives. This may
halt workflow execution unnecessarily, requiring researchers to intervene and
to resume the workflow when no problem actually exists, negating the benefits
of autonomous operation. To address this problem, we propose PREVENT a system
comprising navigation and manipulation skills based on a multimodal Behavior
Tree (BT) approach that can be integrated into existing software architectures
with minimal modifications. Our approach involves a hierarchical perception
mechanism that exploits AI techniques and sensory feedback through Dexterous
Vision and Navigational Vision cameras and an IoT gas sensor module for
execution-related decision-making. Experimental evaluations show that the
proposed approach is comparatively efficient and completely avoids both false
negatives and false positives when tested in simulated risk scenarios within
our robotic chemistry workflow. The results also show that the proposed
multi-modal perception skills achieved deployment accuracies that were higher
than the average of the corresponding uni-modal skills, both for navigation and
for manipulation.

Result: 研究表明韧性是社会机器人的基本特征，通过韧性可以确保用户对机器人本身的信任。

Conclusion: 韧性是确保社会机器人在敏感应用场景中可靠运行和建立用户信任的关键特性。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence continues to advance and becomes more integrated
into sensitive areas like healthcare, education, and everyday life, it's
crucial for these systems to be both resilient and robust. This paper shows how
resilience is a fundamental characteristic of social robots, which, through it,
ensure trust in the robot itself-an essential element especially when operating
in contexts with elderly people, who often have low trust in these systems.
Resilience is therefore the ability to operate under adverse or stressful
conditions, even when degraded or weakened, while maintaining essential
operational capabilities.

Conclusion: 该方法适用于室内外环境的自主感知，能够实现精确的边界精炼，同时保持实时性能。

Abstract: Free space ground segmentation is essential to navigate robots and autonomous
vehicles, recognize drivable zones, and traverse efficiently. Fine-grained
features remain challenging for existing segmentation models, particularly for
robots in indoor and structured environments. These difficulties arise from
ineffective multi-scale processing, suboptimal boundary refinement, and limited
feature representation. In order to overcome these limitations, we propose
Attention-Guided Upsampling with Residual Boundary-Assistive Refinement
(AURASeg), a ground-plane semantic segmentation model that maintains high
segmentation accuracy while improving border precision. Our method uses
CSP-Darknet backbone by adding a Residual Border Refinement Module (RBRM) for
accurate edge delineation and an Attention Progressive Upsampling Decoder
(APUD) for strong feature integration. We also incorporate a lightweight Atrous
Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP-Lite) module to ensure multi-scale context
extraction without compromising real-time performance. The proposed model beats
benchmark segmentation architectures in mIoU and F1 metrics when tested on the
Ground Mobile Robot Perception (GMRP) Dataset and a custom Gazebo indoor
dataset. Our approach achieves an improvement in mean Intersection-over-Union
(mIoU) of +1.26% and segmentation precision of +1.65% compared to
state-of-the-art models. These results show that our technique is feasible for
autonomous perception in both indoor and outdoor environments, enabling precise
border refinement with minimal effect on inference speed.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for pretraining robotic manipulation
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models using a large corpus of unscripted
real-life video recordings of human hand activities. Treating human hand as
dexterous robot end-effector, we show that "in-the-wild" egocentric human
videos without any annotations can be transformed into data formats fully
aligned with existing robotic V-L-A training data in terms of task granularity
and labels. This is achieved by the development of a fully-automated holistic
human activity analysis approach for arbitrary human hand videos. This approach
can generate atomic-level hand activity segments and their language
descriptions, each accompanied with framewise 3D hand motion and camera motion.
We process a large volume of egocentric videos and create a hand-VLA training
dataset containing 1M episodes and 26M frames. This training data covers a wide
range of objects and concepts, dexterous manipulation tasks, and environment
variations in real life, vastly exceeding the coverage of existing robot data.
We design a dexterous hand VLA model architecture and pretrain the model on
this dataset. The model exhibits strong zero-shot capabilities on completely
unseen real-world observations. Additionally, fine-tuning it on a small amount
of real robot action data significantly improves task success rates and
generalization to novel objects in real robotic experiments. We also
demonstrate the appealing scaling behavior of the model's task performance with
respect to pretraining data scale. We believe this work lays a solid foundation
for scalable VLA pretraining, advancing robots toward truly generalizable
embodied intelligence.

Abstract: Achieving safe, reliable real-world robotic manipulation requires agents to
evolve beyond vision and incorporate tactile sensing to overcome sensory
deficits and reliance on idealised state information. Despite its potential,
the efficacy of tactile sensing in reinforcement learning (RL) remains
inconsistent. We address this by developing self-supervised learning (SSL)
methodologies to more effectively harness tactile observations, focusing on a
scalable setup of proprioception and sparse binary contacts. We empirically
demonstrate that sparse binary tactile signals are critical for dexterity,
particularly for interactions that proprioceptive control errors do not
register, such as decoupled robot-object motions. Our agents achieve superhuman
dexterity in complex contact tasks (ball bouncing and Baoding ball rotation).
Furthermore, we find that decoupling the SSL memory from the on-policy memory
can improve performance. We release the Robot Tactile Olympiad (RoTO) benchmark
to standardise and promote future research in tactile-based manipulation.

Abstract: Micro aerial vehicles are becoming increasingly important in search and
rescue operations due to their agility, speed, and ability to access confined
spaces or hazardous areas. However, designing lightweight aerial systems
presents significant structural, aerodynamic, and computational challenges.
This work addresses two key limitations in many low-cost aerial systems under
two kilograms: their lack of structural durability during flight through rough
terrains and inability to replan paths dynamically when new victims or
obstacles are detected. We present a fully customised drone built from scratch
using only commonly available components and materials, emphasising modularity,
low cost, and ease of assembly. The structural frame is reinforced with
lightweight yet durable materials to withstand impact, while the onboard
control system is powered entirely by free, open-source software solutions. The
proposed system demonstrates real-time perception and adaptive navigation
capabilities without relying on expensive hardware accelerators, offering an
affordable and practical solution for real-world search and rescue missions.
