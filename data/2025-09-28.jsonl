Safely clearing a path on challenging terrain, such as a cluttered\nstaircase, requires controlled interaction. For example, a quadrupedal robot\nthat pushes objects out of the way with one leg while maintaining a stable\nstance with its three other legs. However, tightly coupled physical actions,\nsuch as one-legged pushing, create new constraints on the system that can be\ndifficult to predict at design time. In this work, we present a new method that\naddresses one such constraint, wherein the object being pushed by a quadrupedal\nrobot with one of its legs becomes occluded from the robot's sensors during\nmanipulation. To address this challenge, we present a tightly coupled\nperception-action framework that enables the robot to perceive clutter, reason\nabout feasible push paths, and execute the clearing maneuver. Our core\ncontribution is an interaction-aware state estimation loop that uses\nproprioceptive feedback regarding foot contact and leg position to predict an\nobject's displacement during the occlusion. This prediction guides the\nperception system to robustly re-detect the object after the interaction,\nclosing the loop between action and sensing to enable accurate tracking even\nafter partial pushes. Using this feedback allows the robot to learn from\nphysical outcomes, reclassifying an object as immovable if a push fails due to\nit being too heavy. We present results of implementing our approach on a Boston\nDynamics Spot robot that show our interaction-aware approach achieves higher\ntask success rates and tracking accuracy in pushing objects on stairs compared\nto open-loop baselines."}

However, even\nwell-trained policies remain vulnerable to collisions in obstacle-rich\nenvironments. Addressing these infrequent but critical safety failures through\nretraining or fine-tuning is costly and risks degrading previously learned\nskills. Inspired by activation steering in large language models and latent\nediting in computer vision, we introduce a framework for inference-time Latent\nActivation Editing (LAE) that refines the behavior of pre-trained policies\nwithout modifying their weights or architecture. The framework operates in two\nstages: (i) an online classifier monitors intermediate activations to detect\nstates associated with undesired behaviors, and (ii) an activation editing\nmodule that selectively modifies flagged activations to shift the policy\ntowards safer regimes. In this work, we focus on improving safety in\nmulti-quadrotor navigation. We hypothesize that amplifying a policy's internal\nperception of risk can induce safer behaviors. We instantiate this idea through\na latent collision world model trained to predict future pre-collision\nactivations, thereby prompting earlier and more cautious avoidance responses.\nExtensive simulations and real-world Crazyflie experiments demonstrate that LAE\nachieves statistically significant reduction in collisions (nearly 90% fewer\ncumulative collisions compared to the unedited baseline) and substantially\nincreases the fraction of collision-free trajectories, while preserving task\ncompletion. More broadly, our results establish LAE as a lightweight paradigm,\nfeasible on resource-constrained hardware, for post-deployment refinement of\nlearned robot policies."}

This anthropomorphic approach creates two critical barriers: 1) it\nlimits robotic capabilities to tasks humans can already perform, and 2) it\nmakes data collection for learning-based methods exceedingly difficult. Both\nchallenges are caused by traditional force-closure which requires coordinating\ncomplex, multi-point contacts based on friction, normal force, and gravity to\ngrasp an object. This makes teleoperated demonstrations unstable and amplifies\nthe sim-to-real gap for reinforcement learning.

Advanced\ndriving skills are those necessary to safely push the vehicle to its handling\nlimits in high-performance driving such as racing and emergency obstacle\navoidance. Previous research has demonstrated the performance and safety\nbenefits of shared control schemes using both subjective and objective\nevaluations. However, these schemes have not been assessed for their impact on\nskill acquisition on complex and demanding tasks. Prior research on long-term\nskill acquisition either applies haptic shared control to simple tasks or\nemploys other feedback methods like visual and auditory aids. To bridge this\ngap, this study creates a cyber racing coach framework based on the haptic\nshared control paradigm and evaluates its performance in helping human drivers\nacquire high-performance driving skills. The framework introduces (1) an\nautonomous driving system that is capable of cooperating with humans in a\nhighly performant driving scenario; and (2) a haptic shared control mechanism\nalong with a fading scheme to gradually reduce the steering assistance from\nautonomy based on the human driver's performance during training.

Unlike\ntraditional modular pipelines, end-to-end learning mitigates key limitations\nsuch as information loss between modules and feature misalignment caused by\nisolated optimization targets. Despite these advantages, existing end-to-end\nneural networks for robotic manipulation--including those based on large\nVLM/VLA models--remain insufficiently performant for large-scale practical\ndeployment. In this paper, we take a step towards an end-to-end manipulation\npolicy that is generalizable, accurate and reliable. To achieve this goal, we\npropose a novel Chain of Moving Oriented Keypoints (CoMOK) formulation for\nrobotic manipulation. Our formulation is used as the action representation of a\nneural policy, which can be trained in an end-to-end fashion. Such an action\nrepresentation is general, as it extends the standard end-effector pose action\nrepresentation and supports a diverse set of manipulation tasks in a unified\nmanner. The oriented keypoint in our method enables natural generalization to\nobjects with different shapes and sizes, while achieving sub-centimeter\naccuracy. Moreover, our formulation can easily handle multi-stage tasks,\nmulti-modal robot behaviors, and deformable objects. Extensive simulated and\nhardware experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."}

To meet such challenges, we propose RAM-NAS, a resource-aware\nmulti-objective NAS method that focuses on improving the supernet pretrain and\nresource-awareness on robot hardware devices. We introduce the concept of\nsubnets mutual distillation, which refers to mutually distilling all subnets\nsampled by the sandwich rule. Additionally, we utilize the Decoupled Knowledge\nDistillation (DKD) loss to enhance logits distillation performance. To expedite\nthe search process with consideration for hardware resources, we used data from\nthree types of robotic edge hardware to train Latency Surrogate predictors.\nThese predictors facilitated the estimation of hardware inference latency\nduring the search phase, enabling a unified multi-objective evolutionary search\nto balance model accuracy and latency trade-offs. Our discovered model family,\nRAM-NAS models, can achieve top-1 accuracy ranging from 76.7% to 81.4% on\nImageNet.

To\naddress this inefficiency, we propose KeyWorld, a framework that improves\ntext-conditioned robotic world models by concentrating transformers computation\non a few semantic key frames while employing a lightweight convolutional model\nto fill the intermediate frames. Specifically, KeyWorld first identifies\nsignificant transitions by iteratively simplifying the robot's motion\ntrajectories, obtaining the ground truth key frames.
