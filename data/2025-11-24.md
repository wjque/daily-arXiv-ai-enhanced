### [1] [Parameter-Free Neural Lens Blur Rendering for High-Fidelity Composites](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17014)
*Lingyan Ruan,Bin Chen,Taehyun Rhee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种直接从RGB图像估计弥散圆(CoC)地图的新方法，无需场景深度或相机参数，用于在混合现实中渲染逼真的镜头模糊效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖相机参数和场景深度来计算弥散圆，但这些信息普通用户通常无法获取，限制了方法的可访问性和通用性

Conclusion: 该方法为实际应用提供了灵活实用的解决方案，能够实现逼真的混合现实合成效果

Abstract: Consistent and natural camera lens blur is important for seamlessly blending 3D virtual objects into photographed real-scenes. Since lens blur typically varies with scene depth, the placement of virtual objects and their corresponding blur levels significantly affect the visual fidelity of mixed reality compositions. Existing pipelines often rely on camera parameters (e.g., focal length, focus distance, aperture size) and scene depth to compute the circle of confusion (CoC) for realistic lens blur rendering. However, such information is often unavailable to ordinary users, limiting the accessibility and generalizability of these methods. In this work, we propose a novel compositing approach that directly estimates the CoC map from RGB images, bypassing the need for scene depth or camera metadata. The CoC values for virtual objects are inferred through a linear relationship between its signed CoC map and depth, and realistic lens blur is rendered using a neural reblurring network. Our method provides flexible and practical solution for real-world applications. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high-fidelity compositing with realistic defocus effects, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种原生3D编辑框架，通过单次前向传播直接操作3D表示，解决了现有方法在几何一致性和视觉质量方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指令引导的3D编辑方法存在关键限制：基于优化的方法速度过慢，而基于多视图2D编辑的前馈方法往往存在几何不一致和视觉质量下降的问题。

Method: 创建大规模多模态数据集用于指令引导的3D编辑，涵盖添加、删除和修改任务。探索两种条件策略：传统交叉注意力机制和新型3D标记拼接方法。

Result: 标记拼接方法在参数效率方面更优且性能更好。广泛评估表明该方法在生成质量、3D一致性和指令保真度方面优于现有2D提升方法。

Conclusion: 提出的原生3D编辑框架为3D内容创作设定了新的基准，在保持未编辑区域一致性的同时，确保编辑对象忠实遵循指令变化。

Abstract: Instruction-guided 3D editing is a rapidly emerging field with the potential to broaden access to 3D content creation. However, existing methods face critical limitations: optimization-based approaches are prohibitively slow, while feed-forward approaches relying on multi-view 2D editing often suffer from inconsistent geometry and degraded visual quality. To address these issues, we propose a novel native 3D editing framework that directly manipulates 3D representations in a single, efficient feed-forward pass. Specifically, we create a large-scale, multi-modal dataset for instruction-guided 3D editing, covering diverse addition, deletion, and modification tasks. This dataset is meticulously curated to ensure that edited objects faithfully adhere to the instructional changes while preserving the consistency of unedited regions with the source object. Building upon this dataset, we explore two distinct conditioning strategies for our model: a conventional cross-attention mechanism and a novel 3D token concatenation approach. Our results demonstrate that token concatenation is more parameter-efficient and achieves superior performance. Extensive evaluations show that our method outperforms existing 2D-lifting approaches, setting a new benchmark in generation quality, 3D consistency, and instruction fidelity.

### [3] [The persistence of painting styles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16695)
*Reetikaa Reddy Munnangi,Barbara Giunti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用持久同调（PH）方法从拓扑数据分析角度客观识别艺术风格，能够统计显著地区分不同艺术家、同一流派内的艺术家，以及真实艺术家作品与AI生成作品。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统艺术风格识别依赖艺术史学家或评论家的视觉直觉和经验，缺乏客观性。数学工具的发展为艺术分析提供了结构化视角。

Method: 采用拓扑数据分析中的持久同调（PH）方法，通过分析艺术作品中的拓扑特征来识别艺术风格。

Result: PH方法能够以统计显著性区分不同艺术家、同一艺术流派内的艺术家，并能辨别真实艺术家作品与AI生成的模仿作品。

Conclusion: 持久同调为艺术风格分析提供了客观、可解释的数学工具，能够有效识别艺术作品的独特特征和真实性。

Abstract: Art is a deeply personal and expressive medium, where each artist brings their own style, technique, and cultural background into their work. Traditionally, identifying artistic styles has been the job of art historians or critics, relying on visual intuition and experience. However, with the advancement of mathematical tools, we can explore art through more structured lens. In this work, we show how persistent homology (PH), a method from topological data analysis, provides objective and interpretable insights on artistic styles. We show how PH can, with statistical certainty, differentiate between artists, both from different artistic currents and from the same one, and distinguish images of an artist from an AI-generated image in the artist's style.

Conclusion: 该模型具有解耦运动组件作为风格参数的潜力，为猕猴面部表情研究提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: Generating animal faces using generative AI techniques is challenging because the available training images are limited both in quantity and variation, particularly for facial expressions across individuals. In this study, we focus on macaque monkeys, widely studied in systems neuroscience and evolutionary research, and propose a method to generate their facial expressions using a style-based generative image model (i.e., StyleGAN2). To address data limitations, we implemented: 1) data augmentation by synthesizing new facial expression images using a motion transfer to animate still images with computer graphics, 2) sample selection based on the latent representation of macaque faces from an initially trained StyleGAN2 model to ensure the variation and uniform sampling in training dataset, and 3) loss function refinement to ensure the accurate reproduction of subtle movements, such as eye movements. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method enables the generation of diverse facial expressions for multiple macaque individuals, outperforming models trained solely on original still images. Additionally, we show that our model is effective for style-based image editing, where specific style parameters correspond to distinct facial movements. These findings underscore the model's potential for disentangling motion components as style parameters, providing a valuable tool for research on macaque facial expressions.

Abstract: Personalized dual-person portrait customization has considerable potential applications, such as preserving emotional memories and facilitating wedding photography planning. However, the absence of a benchmark dataset hinders the pursuit of high-quality customization in dual-person portrait generation. In this paper, we propose the PairHuman dataset, which is the first large-scale benchmark dataset specifically designed for generating dual-person portraits that meet high photographic standards. The PairHuman dataset contains more than 100K images that capture a variety of scenes, attire, and dual-person interactions, along with rich metadata, including detailed image descriptions, person localization, human keypoints, and attribute tags. We also introduce DHumanDiff, which is a baseline specifically crafted for dual-person portrait generation that features enhanced facial consistency and simultaneously balances in personalized person generation and semantic-driven scene creation. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that our dataset and method produce highly customized portraits with superior visual quality that are tailored to human preferences. Our dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/annaoooo/PairHuman.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于无监督自动编码器和CDF 97小波变换的混合高斯-泊松去噪方法，用于中子成像数据去噪，相比传统方法具有更好的重建误差和边缘保持能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中子成像在惯性约束聚变分析中很重要，但图像常被高斯和泊松混合噪声退化，传统滤波和阈值方法难以有效去除这些重叠噪声，需要开发能保持图像保真度的去噪技术。

Method: 使用无监督自动编码器，在潜在空间中结合Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau (CDF 97)小波变换，专门针对混合高斯-泊松噪声进行去噪。

Result: 该方法成功去除了中子成像数据中的噪声，与BM3D等非机器学习滤波方法相比，显示出更低的重建误差和更优的边缘保持指标。

Conclusion: 这种方法在中子图像噪声减少和ICF实验的三维重建分析方面展现了有前景的进展。

Abstract: Neutron imaging is important in optimizing analysis of inertial confinement fusion (ICF) events such as those at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) and improving current and future ICF platforms. However, images of neutron sources are often degraded by various types of noise. Most commonly, Gaussian and Poisson noise often coexist within one image, obscuring fine details and blurring edges. These noise types often overlap, making them difficult to distinguish and remove using conventional filtering and thresholding methods. As a result, noise removal techniques that preserve image fidelity are important for analyzing and interpreting images of a neutron source. Current solutions include a combination of filtering and thresholding methodologies. In the past, machine learning approaches were rarely implemented due to a lack of ground truth neutron imaging data for ICF processes. However, recent advances in synthetic data production, particularly in the fusion imaging field, have opened opportunities to investigate new denoising procedures using both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. In this study, we implement an unsupervised autoencoder with a Cohen-Daubechies- Feauveau (CDF 97) wavelet transform in the latent space for mixed Gaussian-Poisson denoising. The network successfully denoises neutron imaging data. Additionally, it demonstrates lower reconstruction error and superior edge preservation metrics when benchmarked with data generated by a forward model and compared to non-ML-based filtering mechanisms such as Block-matching and 3D filtering (BM3D). This approach presents a promising advancement in neutron image noise reduction and three-dimensional reconstruction analysis of ICF experiments.

TL;DR: SAM 3是一个统一模型，能够基于概念提示（名词短语或图像示例）在图像和视频中检测、分割和跟踪对象，在提示概念分割任务上准确率比现有系统提高一倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够基于多样化概念提示（包括名词短语和图像示例）进行对象检测、分割和跟踪的统一模型，解决现有系统在提示概念分割任务上的局限性。

Method: 构建可扩展数据引擎生成包含400万个独特概念标签的高质量数据集；模型包含图像级检测器和基于内存的视频跟踪器，共享单一骨干网络；通过存在头分离识别和定位，提升检测精度。

Result: SAM 3在图像和视频提示概念分割任务上的准确率比现有系统提高一倍，并在视觉分割任务上改进了之前SAM的能力。

Conclusion: SAM 3在提示概念分割方面取得了显著进展，开源了模型和新的SA-Co基准测试，为视觉分割任务提供了强大的统一解决方案。

Abstract: We present Segment Anything Model (SAM) 3, a unified model that detects, segments, and tracks objects in images and videos based on concept prompts, which we define as either short noun phrases (e.g., "yellow school bus"), image exemplars, or a combination of both. Promptable Concept Segmentation (PCS) takes such prompts and returns segmentation masks and unique identities for all matching object instances. To advance PCS, we build a scalable data engine that produces a high-quality dataset with 4M unique concept labels, including hard negatives, across images and videos. Our model consists of an image-level detector and a memory-based video tracker that share a single backbone. Recognition and localization are decoupled with a presence head, which boosts detection accuracy. SAM 3 doubles the accuracy of existing systems in both image and video PCS, and improves previous SAM capabilities on visual segmentation tasks. We open source SAM 3 along with our new Segment Anything with Concepts (SA-Co) benchmark for promptable concept segmentation.

### [8] [SafeR-CLIP: Mitigating NSFW Content in Vision-Language Models While Preserving Pre-Trained Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16743)
*Adeel Yousaf,Joseph Fioresi,James Beetham,Amrit Singh Bedi,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SaFeR-CLIP通过将不安全概念重定向到语义上最接近的安全替代品，在保持安全性的同时显著提高了视觉语言模型的泛化性能，恢复了高达8.0%的零样本准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的视觉语言模型安全微调方法往往导致泛化性能显著下降，这是因为刚性对齐策略破坏了模型学习到的语义结构。

Method: 提出邻近感知方法，将不安全概念重定向到语义上最接近的安全替代品，以最小化表示变化。开发了SaFeR-CLIP微调框架，应用最小干预原则。

Result: SaFeR-CLIP成功平衡了安全性和性能，相比先前方法恢复了高达8.0%的零样本准确率，同时保持强大的安全性。还贡献了NSFW-Caps基准测试集。

Conclusion: 尊重预训练表示的几何结构是实现安全而不牺牲性能的关键。

Abstract: Improving the safety of vision-language models like CLIP via fine-tuning often comes at a steep price, causing significant drops in their generalization performance. We find this trade-off stems from rigid alignment strategies that force unsafe concepts toward single, predefined safe targets, disrupting the model's learned semantic structure. To address this, we propose a proximity-aware approach: redirecting unsafe concepts to their semantically closest safe alternatives to minimize representational change. We introduce SaFeR-CLIP, a fine-tuning framework that applies this principle of minimal intervention. SaFeR-CLIP successfully reconciles safety and performance, recovering up to 8.0% in zero-shot accuracy over prior methods while maintaining robust safety. To support more rigorous evaluation, we also contribute NSFW-Caps, a new benchmark of 1,000 highly-aligned pairs for testing safety under distributional shift. Our work shows that respecting the geometry of pretrained representations is key to achieving safety without sacrificing performance.

### [9] [SVG360: Multi-View SVG Generation with Geometric and Color Consistency from a Single SVG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16766)
*Mengnan Jiang,Zhaolin Sun,Christian Franke,Michele Franco Adesso,Antonio Haas,Grace Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个三阶段框架，从单视图SVG输入生成多视图一致的SVG，具有几何和颜色一致性，减少了冗余路径并保留了细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单对象SVG从单视图输入生成多视图一致SVG的研究不足，需要解决几何和颜色一致性问题。

Method: 三阶段框架：1) 将栅格化输入提升为3D表示并渲染多视图图像；2) 扩展SAM2的时间记忆机制到空间域，构建空间记忆库建立跨视图部件级对应关系；3) 栅格到矢量转换时进行路径整合和结构优化。

Conclusion: 该工作连接了生成建模和结构化矢量表示，为单输入、对象级多视图SVG生成提供了可扩展路径，支持资产创建和语义矢量编辑等应用。

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) are central to modern design workflows, offering scaling without distortion and precise editability. However, for single object SVGs, generating multi-view consistent SVGs from a single-view input remains underexplored. We present a three stage framework that produces multi-view SVGs with geometric and color consistency from a single SVG input. First, the rasterized input is lifted to a 3D representation and rendered under target camera poses, producing multi-view images of the object. Next, we extend the temporal memory mechanism of Segment Anything 2 (SAM2) to the spatial domain, constructing a spatial memory bank that establishes part level correspondences across neighboring views, yielding cleaner and more consistent vector paths and color assignments without retraining. Finally, during the raster to vector conversion, we perform path consolidation and structural optimization to reduce redundancy while preserving boundaries and semantics. The resulting SVGs exhibit strong geometric and color consistency across views, significantly reduce redundant paths, and retain fine structural details. This work bridges generative modeling and structured vector representation, providing a scalable route to single input, object level multi-view SVG generation and supporting applications such as asset creation and semantic vector editing.

Conclusion: Mesh RAG框架有效解决了自回归网格生成中的质量-速度权衡问题，无需重新训练模型即可提升性能并支持增量编辑。

Abstract: 3D meshes are a critical building block for applications ranging from industrial design and gaming to simulation and robotics. Traditionally, meshes are crafted manually by artists, a process that is time-intensive and difficult to scale. To automate and accelerate this asset creation, autoregressive models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for artistic mesh generation. However, current methods to enhance quality typically rely on larger models or longer sequences that result in longer generation time, and their inherent sequential nature imposes a severe quality-speed trade-off. This sequential dependency also significantly complicates incremental editing. To overcome these limitations, we propose Mesh RAG, a novel, training-free, plug-and-play framework for autoregressive mesh generation models. Inspired by RAG for language models, our approach augments the generation process by leveraging point cloud segmentation, spatial transformation, and point cloud registration to retrieve, generate, and integrate mesh components. This retrieval-based approach decouples generation from its strict sequential dependency, facilitating efficient and parallelizable inference. We demonstrate the wide applicability of Mesh RAG across various foundational autoregressive mesh generation models, showing it significantly enhances mesh quality, accelerates generation speed compared to sequential part prediction, and enables incremental editing, all without model retraining.

Abstract: Recent progress in vision language models (VLMs) has enabled remarkable perception and reasoning capabilities, yet their potential for scientific regression in Earth Observation (EO) remains largely unexplored. Existing EO datasets mainly emphasize semantic understanding tasks such as captioning or classification, lacking benchmarks that align multimodal perception with measurable biophysical variables. To fill this gap, we present REO-Instruct, the first unified benchmark designed for both descriptive and regression tasks in EO. REO-Instruct establishes a cognitively interpretable logic chain in forest ecological scenario (human activity,land-cover classification, ecological patch counting, above-ground biomass (AGB) regression), bridging qualitative understanding and quantitative prediction. The dataset integrates co-registered Sentinel-2 and ALOS-2 imagery with structured textual annotations generated and validated through a hybrid human AI pipeline. Comprehensive evaluation protocols and baseline results across generic VLMs reveal that current models struggle with numeric reasoning, highlighting an essential challenge for scientific VLMs. REO-Instruct offers a standardized foundation for developing and assessing next-generation geospatial models capable of both description and scientific inference.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance on spatial reasoning benchmarks, yet these evaluations mask critical weaknesses in understanding object interactions. Current benchmarks test high level relationships ('left of,' 'behind', etc.) but ignore fine-grained spatial understanding needed for real world applications: precise 3D localization, physical compatibility between objects, object affordances and multi step spatial planning. In this work, we present BOP-ASK, a novel large scale dataset for object interaction reasoning for both training and benchmarking. Our data generation pipeline leverages 6D object poses from the Benchmark for Object Pose Estimation (BOP) datasets from which we derive fine grained annotations such as grasp poses, referred object poses, path planning trajectories, relative spatial and depth relationships, and object-to-object relationships. BOP-ASK comprises over 150k images and 33M question answer pairs spanning six tasks (four novel), providing a rich resource for training and evaluating VLMs. We evaluate proprietary and open sourced VLMs, and conduct human evaluations on BOP-ASK-core, a contributed test benchmark. We also release BOP-ASK-lab, an out-of-distribution benchmark with images not sourced from BOP, enabling testing of generalization. Our experiments demonstrate that models trained on BOP-ASK outperform baselines and exhibit emergent capabilities such as precise object and grasp pose estimation, trajectory planning, and fine-grained object-centric spatial reasoning in cluttered environments. We will publicly release our datasets and dataset generation pipeline.

*Tianyi Shen,Huijuan Xu,Nilesh Ahuja,Omesh Tickoo,Philip Shin,Vijaykrishnan Narayanan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Parts-Mamba模型，结合GCN和Mamba架构，用于解决骨架动作识别中因遮挡或通信质量差导致的骨架不完整问题，在NTU RGB+D数据集上取得了高达12.9%的准确率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中捕获的骨架数据常因身体部位遮挡或通信质量问题而不完整，现有GCN模型在局部上下文缺失时表现不佳，需要增强对远距离关节上下文信息的捕捉能力。

Method: 提出了Parts-Mamba混合模型，通过部件特定扫描特征捕获部件特定信息，并通过部件-身体融合模块保留非邻近关节的上下文信息。

Result: 在NTU RGB+D 60和NTU RGB+D 120数据集的不同遮挡设置下进行评估，准确率最高提升12.9%。

Conclusion: Parts-Mamba模型能有效处理骨架数据不完整的问题，通过增强对远距离关节上下文信息的捕捉能力，显著提升了骨架动作识别在遮挡情况下的性能。

Abstract: Skeleton action recognition involves recognizing human action from human skeletons. The use of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) has driven major advances in this recognition task. In real-world scenarios, the captured skeletons are not always perfect or complete because of occlusions of parts of the human body or poor communication quality, leading to missing parts in skeletons or videos with missing frames. In the presence of such non-idealities, existing GCN models perform poorly due to missing local context. To address this limitation, we propose Parts-Mamba, a hybrid GCN-Mamba model designed to enhance the ability to capture and maintain contextual information from distant joints. The proposed Parts-Mamba model effectively captures part-specific information through its parts-specific scanning feature and preserves non-neighboring joint context via a parts-body fusion module. Our proposed model is evaluated on the NTU RGB+D 60 and NTU RGB+D 120 datasets under different occlusion settings, achieving up to 12.9% improvement in accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的Gromov-Wasserstein距离仅限于单对单对象匹配，无法满足需要多对一或多对多匹配的应用场景需求。

Method: 通过引入JGW目标，扩展GW框架以支持对象集合的同时匹配，采用最优传输算法（包括熵正则化）进行求解。

Conclusion: JGW方法为解决计算机图形学和结构生物学等领域的复杂匹配问题提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: The Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance serves as a powerful tool for matching objects in metric spaces. However, its traditional formulation is constrained to pairwise matching between single objects, limiting its utility in scenarios and applications requiring multiple-to-one or multiple-to-multiple object matching. In this paper, we introduce the Joint Gromov-Wasserstein (JGW) objective and extend the original framework of GW to enable simultaneous matching between collections of objects. Our formulation provides a non-negative dissimilarity measure that identifies partially isomorphic distributions of mm-spaces, with point sampling convergence. We also show that the objective can be formulated and solved for point cloud object representations by adapting traditional algorithms in Optimal Transport, including entropic regularization. Our benchmarking with other variants of GW for partial matching indicates superior performance in accuracy and computational efficiency of our method, while experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show its effectiveness for multiple shape matching, including geometric shapes and biomolecular complexes, suggesting promising applications for solving complex matching problems across diverse domains, including computer graphics and structural biology.

Result: 在超分辨率、框内修复、高斯去模糊和运动去模糊等任务上的实验表明，REPA能一致提升重建质量，同时通过减少离散化步骤数量显著提高效率而不影响求解器性能。

Conclusion: REPA方法通过表示对齐有效提升了逆问题求解的感知保真度和效率，具有广泛的适用性，可集成到多种最先进的逆问题求解器中。

Abstract: Enforcing alignment between the internal representations of diffusion or flow-based generative models and those of pretrained self-supervised encoders has recently been shown to provide a powerful inductive bias, improving both convergence and sample quality. In this work, we extend this idea to inverse problems, where pretrained generative models are employed as priors. We propose applying representation alignment (REPA) between diffusion or flow-based models and a pretrained self-supervised visual encoder, such as DINOv2, to guide the reconstruction process at inference time. Although ground-truth signals are unavailable in inverse problems, we show that aligning model representations with approximate target features can substantially enhance reconstruction fidelity and perceptual realism. We provide theoretical results showing (a) the relation between the REPA regularization and a divergence measure in the DINOv2 embedding space, and (b) how REPA updates steer the model's internal representations toward those of the clean image. These results offer insights into the role of REPA in improving perceptual fidelity. Finally, we demonstrate the generality of our approach by integrating it into multiple state-of-the-art inverse problem solvers. Extensive experiments on super-resolution, box inpainting, Gaussian deblurring, and motion deblurring confirm that our method consistently improves reconstruction quality across tasks, while also providing substantial efficiency gains by reducing the number of required discretization steps without compromising the performance of the underlying solver.

Abstract: Glass surfaces are ubiquitous in daily life, typically appearing colorless, transparent, and lacking distinctive features. These characteristics make glass surface detection a challenging computer vision task. Existing glass surface detection methods always rely on boundary cues (e.g., window and door frames) or reflection cues to locate glass surfaces, but they fail to fully exploit the intrinsic properties of the glass itself for accurate localization. We observed that in most real-world scenes, the illumination intensity in front of the glass surface differs from that behind it, which results in variations in the reflections visible on the glass surface. Specifically, when standing on the brighter side of the glass and applying a flash towards the darker side, existing reflections on the glass surface tend to disappear. Conversely, while standing on the darker side and applying a flash towards the brighter side, distinct reflections will appear on the glass surface. Based on this phenomenon, we propose NFGlassNet, a novel method for glass surface detection that leverages the reflection dynamics present in flash/no-flash imagery. Specifically, we propose a Reflection Contrast Mining Module (RCMM) for extracting reflections, and a Reflection Guided Attention Module (RGAM) for fusing features from reflection and glass surface for accurate glass surface detection. For learning our network, we also construct a dataset consisting of 3.3K no-flash and flash image pairs captured from various scenes with corresponding ground truth annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Our code, model, and dataset will be available upon acceptance of the manuscript.

Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型主要关注简单视频场景，无法反映真实世界中复杂多样的音频-视觉事件。需要构建专门的数据集和模型来推动音频-视觉时空推理能力的发展。

Method: 1) 构建R-AVST数据集：使用LLM提取关键对象、自动空间标注和人工质量检查，包含5K+未修剪视频和27K+对象；2) 提出AVST-Zero模型：基于强化学习，避免中间监督，通过多维奖励直接优化行为。

Abstract: Recently, rapid advancements have been made in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), especially in video understanding tasks. However, current research focuses on simple video scenarios, failing to reflect the complex and diverse nature of real-world audio-visual events in videos. To bridge this gap, we firstly introduce R-AVST, a dataset for audio-visual reasoning featuring fine-grained spatio-temporal annotations. In constructing this, we design a pipeline consisting of LLM-based key object extraction, automatic spatial annotation and manual quality inspection, resulting in over 5K untrimmed videos with 27K objects across 100 types of audio-visual events. Building on this dataset, we define three core tasks for spatio-temporal reasoning in audio-visual scenes and generate more than 8K high-quality, evenly distributed question-answer pairs to effectively benchmark model performance. To further enhance reasoning, we propose AVST-Zero, a reinforcement learning-based model that avoids intermediate supervision, directly optimizing behavior via carefully designed multi-dimensional rewards. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our R-AVST in advancing audio-visual spatio-temporal reasoning, upon which AVST-Zero demonstrates competitive performance compared to existing models. To the best of our knowledge, R-AVST is the first dataset designed for real-world audio-visual spatio-temporal reasoning, and AVST-Zero offers a novel perspective for tackling future challenges in this domain.

*Hao-Chien Hsueh,Chi-En Yen,Wen-Hsiao Peng,Ching-Chun Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Warm Diffusion模型，统一了热扩散（纯噪声）和冷扩散（纯模糊）两种范式，通过模糊-噪声混合扩散来平衡图像相关性和随机性，解决了热扩散早期生成随机性和冷扩散数据流形外问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 热扩散未能利用图像高频细节与低频结构之间的强相关性，导致早期生成步骤的随机行为；而冷扩散虽然利用了图像相关性进行预测，但忽略了噪声在塑造数据流形中的作用，导致性能下降。需要整合两者的优势。

Method: 提出Warm Diffusion（模糊-噪声混合扩散模型BNMD），通过分治策略利用图像中的频谱依赖性，将去噪和去模糊过程解耦来简化分数模型估计。使用模糊-噪声比（BNR）进行频谱分析来研究模型学习动态与数据流形变化之间的权衡。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验验证了该方法在图像生成方面的有效性。

Conclusion: Warm Diffusion成功整合了热扩散和冷扩散的优势，通过模糊-噪声混合方法解决了两种范式的局限性，为扩散模型提供了更统一的框架。

Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models have achieved remarkable success in generative tasks across diverse data types. While recent studies have explored alternative degradation processes beyond Gaussian noise, this paper bridges two key diffusion paradigms: hot diffusion, which relies entirely on noise, and cold diffusion, which uses only blurring without noise. We argue that hot diffusion fails to exploit the strong correlation between high-frequency image detail and low-frequency structures, leading to random behaviors in the early steps of generation. Conversely, while cold diffusion leverages image correlations for prediction, it neglects the role of noise (randomness) in shaping the data manifold, resulting in out-of-manifold issues and partially explaining its performance drop. To integrate both strengths, we propose Warm Diffusion, a unified Blur-Noise Mixture Diffusion Model (BNMD), to control blurring and noise jointly. Our divide-and-conquer strategy exploits the spectral dependency in images, simplifying score model estimation by disentangling the denoising and deblurring processes. We further analyze the Blur-to-Noise Ratio (BNR) using spectral analysis to investigate the trade-off between model learning dynamics and changes in the data manifold. Extensive experiments across benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach for image generation.

Conclusion: Q-Real数据集为AI生成图像的细粒度质量评估提供了有效工具，有助于提升生成模型的性能，特别是在真实性和合理性维度上的改进。

Abstract: Quality assessment of AI-generated content is crucial for evaluating model capability and guiding model optimization. However, most existing quality assessment datasets and models provide only a single quality score, which is too coarse to offer targeted guidance for improving generative models. In current applications of AI-generated images, realism and plausibility are two critical dimensions, and with the emergence of unified generation-understanding models, fine-grained evaluation along these dimensions becomes especially effective for improving generative performance. Therefore, we introduce Q-Real, a novel dataset for fine-grained evaluation of realism and plausibility in AI-generated images. Q-Real consists of 3,088 images generated by popular text-to-image models. For each image, we annotate the locations of major entities and provide a set of judgment questions and attribution descriptions for these along the dimensions of realism and plausibility. Considering that recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) enable fine-grained evaluation of AI-generated images, we construct Q-Real Bench to evaluate them on two tasks: judgment and grounding with reasoning. Finally, to enhance MLLM capabilities, we design a fine-tuning framework and conduct experiments on multiple MLLMs using our dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the high quality and significance of our dataset and the comprehensiveness of the benchmark. Dataset and code will be released upon publication.

Conclusion: 在单一视觉空间中统一模型、任务和表示是实现通用多模态智能的有前景的范式。

Abstract: We present UniModel, a unified generative model that jointly supports visual understanding and visual generation within a single pixel-to-pixel diffusion framework. Our goal is to achieve unification along three axes: the model, the tasks, and the representations. At the representation level, we eliminate modality discrepancies by mapping both text and images into a shared visual space: textual prompts are rendered as painted text images on a clean canvas, and all inputs and outputs are treated purely as RGB pixels. This yields a fully vision-native formulation of multimodal learning. At the task level, a broad range of vision-language problems are cast as pixel-to-pixel transformations in this visual space. For understanding tasks, the model takes an RGB image and produces a painted text image that visually encodes the semantic prediction. For generation tasks, painted text images serve as visual conditions that guide realistic and semantically aligned image synthesis. Captioning and text-to-image generation thus become different directions of the same underlying visual translation process. At the model level, we instantiate a single Unified Diffusion Transformer trained with rectified flow in pixel space. A shared backbone jointly learns bidirectional mappings between natural images and painted text images, with lightweight task embeddings to specify the desired direction. Experiments on text-to-image synthesis and image-to-text understanding demonstrate strong cross-modal alignment and emergent controllability such as cycle-consistent image-caption-image loops. Our initial exploration suggests that unifying model, tasks, and representations in a single visual space is a promising paradigm for general-purpose multimodal intelligence.

Conclusion: DeltaDeno提供了一种无需训练、零样本的异常生成解决方案，能够有效处理异常稀缺问题，并在检测任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Anomaly generation is often framed as few-shot fine-tuning with anomalous samples, which contradicts the scarcity that motivates generation and tends to overfit category priors. We tackle the setting where no real anomaly samples or training are available. We propose Delta-Denoising (DeltaDeno), a training-free zero-shot anomaly generation method that localizes and edits defects by contrasting two diffusion branches driven by a minimal prompt pair under a shared schedule. By accumulating per-step denoising deltas into an image-specific localization map, we obtain a mask to guide the latent inpainting during later diffusion steps and preserve the surrounding context while generating realistic local defects. To improve stability and control, DeltaDeno performs token-level prompt refinement that aligns shared content and strengthens anomaly tokens, and applies a spatial attention bias restricted to anomaly tokens in the predicted region. Experiments on public datasets show that DeltaDeno achieves great generation, realism and consistent gains in downstream detection performance. Code will be made publicly available.

Result: 在复杂真实场景下性能平均下降10.4%，特别是在小/遮挡对象和复杂空间关系上；PG-TAF在OmniGround上m_tIoU和m_vIoU分别提升25.6%和35.6%，在四个基准测试上均获得一致提升。

Conclusion: OmniGround基准测试集和PG-TAF框架有效解决了视频时空定位中的现实挑战，显著提升了模型在复杂场景下的性能。

Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding (STVG) aims to localize target objects in videos based on natural language descriptions. Despite recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models, a significant gap remains between current models and real-world demands involving diverse objects and complex queries. We attribute this to limited benchmark scope, causing models to exhibit category bias, oversimplified reasoning, and poor linguistic robustness. To address these limitations, we introduce OmniGround, a comprehensive benchmark with 3,475 videos spanning 81 categories and complex real-world queries. We propose the Forward-Backward-Refinement annotation pipeline that combines multi-directional tracking with intelligent error correction for high-quality labels. We further introduce DeepSTG, a systematic evaluation framework quantifying dataset quality across four complementary dimensions beyond superficial statistics. Evaluations reveal performance average drop of 10.4% on complex real-world scenes, particularly with small/occluded objects and intricate spatial relations. Motivated by these, we propose PG-TAF, a training-free two-stage framework decomposing STVG into high-level temporal grounding and fine-grained spatio-temporal propagation. Experiments demonstrate PG-TAF achieves 25.6% and 35.6% improvements in m\_tIoU and m\_vIoU on OmniGround with consistent gains across four benchmarks.

Conclusion: 特征域对齐和补偿比像素域更有效，在放大分辨率下变形能更好保留高频信息，提出的方法在视频超分关键方面均取得显著提升。

Abstract: Diffusion model (DM) based Video Super-Resolution (VSR) approaches achieve impressive perceptual quality. However, they suffer from error accumulation, spatial artifacts, and a trade-off between perceptual quality and fidelity, primarily caused by inaccurate alignment and insufficient compensation between video frames. In this paper, within the DM-based VSR pipeline, we revisit the role of alignment and compensation between adjacent video frames and reveal two crucial observations: (a) the feature domain is better suited than the pixel domain for information compensation due to its stronger spatial and temporal correlations, and (b) warping at an upscaled resolution better preserves high-frequency information, but this benefit is not necessarily monotonic. Therefore, we propose a novel Densely Guided diffusion model with Aligned Features for Video Super-Resolution (DGAF-VSR), with an Optical Guided Warping Module (OGWM) to maintain high-frequency details in the aligned features and a Feature-wise Temporal Condition Module (FTCM) to deliver dense guidance in the feature domain. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that DGAF-VSR surpasses state-of-the-art methods in key aspects of VSR, including perceptual quality (35.82\% DISTS reduction), fidelity (0.20 dB PSNR gain), and temporal consistency (30.37\% tLPIPS reduction).

Conclusion: SeeCLIP通过细粒度语义增强有效解决了开放集域泛化中的结构风险与开放空间风险权衡问题

Abstract: Open-Set Domain Generalization (OSDG) tackles the realistic scenario where deployed models encounter both domain shifts and novel object categories. Despite impressive progress with vision-language models like CLIP, existing methods still fall into the dilemma between structural risk of known-classes and open-space risk from unknown-classes, and easily suffers from over-confidence, especially when distinguishing ``hard unknowns" that share fine-grained visual similarities with known classes. To this end, we propose a Semantic-enhanced CLIP (SeeCLIP) framework that explicitly addresses this dilemma through fine-grained semantic enhancement. In SeeCLIP, we propose a semantic-aware prompt enhancement module to decompose images into discriminative semantic tokens, enabling nuanced vision-language alignment beyond coarse category labels. To position unknown prompts effectively, we introduce duplex contrastive learning with complementary objectives, that is, repulsion to maintain separability from known classes, and cohesion to preserve semantic proximity. Further, our semantic-guided diffusion module synthesizes pseudo-unknowns by perturbing extracted semantic tokens, generating challenging samples that are visually similar to known classes yet exhibit key local differences. These hard negatives force the model to learn finer decision boundaries. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements of 3% accuracy and 5% H-score over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Background:Accurate tooth segmentation from cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images is crucial for digital dentistry but remains challenging in cases of interdental adhesions, which cause severe anatomical shape distortion.
  Methods:
  To address this, we propose a deep learning framework that integrates semantic and shape awareness for shape-preserving segmentation. Our method introduces a target-tooth-centroid prompted multi-label learning strategy to model semantic relationships between teeth, reducing shape ambiguity. Additionally, a tooth-shape-aware learning mechanism explicitly enforces morphological constraints to preserve boundary integrity. These components are unified via multi-task learning, jointly optimizing segmentation and shape preservation.
  Results: Extensive evaluations on internal and external datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods.
  Conclusions: Our approach effectively mitigates shape distortions and providing anatomically faithful tooth boundaries.

Abstract: We present FLUID (Face de-identification in the Latent space via Utility-preserving Identity Displacement), a training-free framework that directly substitutes identity in the latent space of pretrained diffusion models. Inspired by substitution mechanisms in chemistry, we reinterpret identity editing as semantic displacement in the latent h-space of a pretrained unconditional diffusion model. Our framework discovers identity-editing directions through optimization guided by novel reagent losses, which supervise for attribute preservation and identity suppression. We further propose both linear and geodesic (tangent-based) editing schemes to effectively navigate the latent manifold. Experimental results on CelebA-HQ and FFHQ demonstrate that FLUID achieves a superior trade-off between identity suppression and attribute preservation, outperforming state-of-the-art de-identification methods in both qualitative and quantitative metrics.

Result: 对50多个基础模型和商业VLM进行大规模评估发现：(1)许多VLM存在显著的未测量推理隐私风险；(2)感知级指标无法预测推理风险；(3)现有安全对齐对此类推理攻击无效。

Conclusion: MultiPriv暴露了系统性漏洞，为开发鲁棒的隐私保护VLM提供了必要框架。

Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate sophisticated reasoning, escalating privacy risks beyond simple attribute perception to individual-level linkage. Current privacy benchmarks are structurally insufficient for this new threat, as they primarily evaluate privacy perception while failing to address the more critical risk of privacy reasoning: a VLM's ability to infer and link distributed information to construct individual profiles. To address this critical gap, we propose \textbf{MultiPriv}, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate individual-level privacy reasoning in VLMs. We introduce the \textbf{Privacy Perception and Reasoning (PPR)} framework and construct a novel, bilingual multimodal dataset to support it. The dataset uniquely features a core component of synthetic individual profiles where identifiers (e.g., faces, names) are meticulously linked to sensitive attributes. This design enables nine challenging tasks evaluating the full PPR spectrum, from attribute detection to cross-image re-identification and chained inference. We conduct a large-scale evaluation of over 50 foundational and commercial VLMs. Our analysis reveals: (1) Many VLMs possess significant, unmeasured reasoning-based privacy risks. (2) Perception-level metrics are poor predictors of these reasoning risks, revealing a critical evaluation gap. (3) Existing safety alignments are inconsistent and ineffective against such reasoning-based attacks. MultiPriv exposes systemic vulnerabilities and provides the necessary framework for developing robust, privacy-preserving VLMs.

Conclusion: RacketVision为动态物体跟踪、条件运动预测和体育多模态分析提供了多功能资源和强起点。

Abstract: We introduce RacketVision, a novel dataset and benchmark for advancing computer vision in sports analytics, covering table tennis, tennis, and badminton. The dataset is the first to provide large-scale, fine-grained annotations for racket pose alongside traditional ball positions, enabling research into complex human-object interactions. It is designed to tackle three interconnected tasks: fine-grained ball tracking, articulated racket pose estimation, and predictive ball trajectory forecasting. Our evaluation of established baselines reveals a critical insight for multi-modal fusion: while naively concatenating racket pose features degrades performance, a CrossAttention mechanism is essential to unlock their value, leading to trajectory prediction results that surpass strong unimodal baselines. RacketVision provides a versatile resource and a strong starting point for future research in dynamic object tracking, conditional motion forecasting, and multimodal analysis in sports.

TL;DR: 提出了一种联合建模动态图像序列和运动场的隐式神经表示框架，通过光流方程进行物理约束，无需预估计运动场即可同时恢复高质量图像和准确运动信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统运动补偿重建方法依赖预估计的光流，但在欠采样情况下光流估计不准确，会降低重建质量。需要一种能同时准确恢复图像和运动场的方法。

Method: 使用两个隐式神经表示(INR)：一个参数化时空图像内容，另一个表示光流场。通过光流方程进行物理约束，结合数据一致性损失，进行联合优化。

Result: 在动态心脏MRI数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于最先进的运动补偿和深度学习方法，实现了更优的重建质量、准确的运动估计和改善的时间保真度。

Conclusion: 基于流正则化约束的隐式联合建模在动态MRI重建中具有巨大潜力，能够同时恢复时间相干图像和运动场。

Abstract: Dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) captures temporally-resolved anatomy but is often challenged by limited sampling and motion-induced artifacts. Conventional motion-compensated reconstructions typically rely on pre-estimated optical flow, which is inaccurate under undersampling and degrades reconstruction quality. In this work, we propose a novel implicit neural representation (INR) framework that jointly models both the dynamic image sequence and its underlying motion field. Specifically, one INR is employed to parameterize the spatiotemporal image content, while another INR represents the optical flow. The two are coupled via the optical flow equation, which serves as a physics-inspired regularization, in addition to a data consistency loss that enforces agreement with k-space measurements. This joint optimization enables simultaneous recovery of temporally coherent images and motion fields without requiring prior flow estimation. Experiments on dynamic cardiac MRI datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art motion-compensated and deep learning approaches, achieving superior reconstruction quality, accurate motion estimation, and improved temporal fidelity. These results highlight the potential of implicit joint modeling with flow-regularized constraints for advancing dMRI reconstruction.

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一的行人跟踪框架OmniPT，能够进行跟踪、基于参考的跟踪以及交互式生成跟踪对象的语义理解，在跟踪基准测试中表现优于先前方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LVLMs在图像级任务中表现出色，但在实例级任务（如视觉定位和目标检测）中仍存在性能差距。行人跟踪任务需要模型在高级语义层面理解跟踪对象，这正是LVLMs的优势所在。

Method: 采用RL-Mid Training-SFT-RL训练阶段：基于预训练的LVLM权重，首先进行RL阶段使模型输出固定可监督的边界框格式；然后使用大量行人相关数据集进行中间训练；最后在多个行人跟踪数据集上进行监督微调，再进行RL阶段以提升跟踪性能和指令跟随能力。

Result: 在跟踪基准测试中的实验结果表明，所提出的方法能够比先前方法表现更好。

Conclusion: OmniPT框架成功将行人跟踪任务建模为基础模型可以执行的任务，并实现了格式化的输出，在跟踪性能上取得了改进。

Abstract: LVLMs have been shown to perform excellently in image-level tasks such as VQA and caption. However, in many instance-level tasks, such as visual grounding and object detection, LVLMs still show performance gaps compared to previous expert models. Meanwhile, although pedestrian tracking is a classical task, there have been a number of new topics in combining object tracking and natural language, such as Referring MOT, Cross-view Referring MOT, and Semantic MOT. These tasks emphasize that models should understand the tracked object at an advanced semantic level, which is exactly where LVLMs excel. In this paper, we propose a new unified Pedestrian Tracking framework, namely OmniPT, which can track, track based on reference and generate semantic understanding of tracked objects interactively. We address two issues: how to model the tracking task into a task that foundation models can perform, and how to make the model output formatted answers. To this end, we implement a training phase consisting of RL-Mid Training-SFT-RL. Based on the pre-trained weights of the LVLM, we first perform a simple RL phase to enable the model to output fixed and supervisable bounding box format. Subsequently, we conduct a mid-training phase using a large number of pedestrian-related datasets. Finally, we perform supervised fine-tuning on several pedestrian tracking datasets, and then carry out another RL phase to improve the model's tracking performance and enhance its ability to follow instructions. We conduct experiments on tracking benchmarks and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can perform better than the previous methods.

TL;DR: 提出了FingerCap任务和FiGOP方法，用于生成细粒度手指级手部运动描述，通过结合RGB帧和手部关键点来解决视频MLLMs在捕捉细微手指运动时的时序稀疏性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解细粒度人类手部运动对视觉感知、具身智能和多模态通信至关重要，但现有视频MLLMs因时序稀疏性难以捕捉细微的手指级动态。

Method: 构建FingerCap-40K数据集，提出FiGOP方法将RGB关键帧与后续手部关键点配对，通过轻量级时序编码器将关键点转换为运动嵌入并与RGB特征集成。

Result: 在FingerCap-40K上的实验表明，现有视频MLLMs在手指级推理方面仍有困难，而FiGOP增强模型在HandJudge和人类评估中均取得一致提升。

Conclusion: FiGOP方法有效解决了视频MLLMs在捕捉细粒度手指运动时的时序稀疏性问题，为手部运动理解提供了新思路。

Abstract: Understanding fine-grained human hand motion is fundamental to visual perception, embodied intelligence, and multimodal communication. In this work, we propose Fine-grained Finger-level Hand Motion Captioning (FingerCap), which aims to generate textual descriptions that capture detailed finger-level semantics of hand actions. To support this task, we curate FingerCap-40K, a large-scale corpus of 40K paired hand-motion videos and captions spanning two complementary sources: concise instruction-style finger motions and diverse, naturalistic hand-object interactions. To enable effective evaluation, we employ HandJudge, a LLM-based rubric that measures finger-level correctness and motion completeness. Temporal sparsity remains a fundamental bottleneck for current Video-MLLMs, since sparse RGB sampling is insufficient to capture the subtle, high-frequency dynamics underlying fine finger motions. As a simple and compute-friendly remedy, we introduce FiGOP (Finger Group-of-Pictures), which pairs each RGB keyframe with subsequent hand keypoints until the next keyframe. A lightweight temporal encoder converts the keypoints into motion embeddings and integrates them with RGB features. FiGOP adapts the classic GOP concept to finger motion, recovering fine temporal cues without increasing RGB density. Experiments on FingerCap-40K show that strong open- and closed-source Video-MLLMs still struggle with finger-level reasoning, while our FiGOP-augmented model yield consistent gains under HandJudge and human studies.

Method: 使用Brownian Bridge扩散模型合成2D MRI切片，同时通过微调检索模型从先验数据库中检索结构和病理相似的CT切片作为参考，通过ControlNet分支指导中间MRI切片生成，并对罕见检索失败情况应用球面线性插值。

Conclusion: ReBrain框架能够有效解决稀疏CT扫描重建完整脑部MRI的挑战，为无法进行MRI扫描的患者提供替代方案。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a crucial role in brain disease diagnosis, but it is not always feasible for certain patients due to physical or clinical constraints. Recent studies attempt to synthesize MRI from Computed Tomography (CT) scans; however, low-dose protocols often result in highly sparse CT volumes with poor through-plane resolution, making accurate reconstruction of the full brain MRI volume particularly challenging. To address this, we propose ReBrain, a retrieval-augmented diffusion framework for brain MRI reconstruction. Given any 3D CT scan with limited slices, we first employ a Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (BBDM) to synthesize MRI slices along the 2D dimension. Simultaneously, we retrieve structurally and pathologically similar CT slices from a comprehensive prior database via a fine-tuned retrieval model. These retrieved slices are used as references, incorporated through a ControlNet branch to guide the generation of intermediate MRI slices and ensure structural continuity. We further account for rare retrieval failures when the database lacks suitable references and apply spherical linear interpolation to provide supplementary guidance. Extensive experiments on SynthRAD2023 and BraTS demonstrate that ReBrain achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-modal reconstruction under sparse conditions.

Conclusion: 提出的点监督面部表情检测框架能够仅使用单时间戳标注实现准确的表情检测和分类，为表情分析提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Automatic facial expression spotting, which aims to identify facial expression instances in untrimmed videos, is crucial for facial expression analysis. Existing methods primarily focus on fully-supervised learning and rely on costly, time-consuming temporal boundary annotations. In this paper, we investigate point-supervised facial expression spotting (P-FES), where only a single timestamp annotation per instance is required for training. We propose a unique two-branch framework for P-FES. First, to mitigate the limitation of hard pseudo-labeling, which often confuses neutral and expression frames with various intensities, we propose a Gaussian-based instance-adaptive intensity modeling (GIM) module to model instance-level expression intensity distribution for soft pseudo-labeling. By detecting the pseudo-apex frame around each point label, estimating the duration, and constructing an instance-level Gaussian distribution, GIM assigns soft pseudo-labels to expression frames for more reliable intensity supervision. The GIM module is incorporated into our framework to optimize the class-agnostic expression intensity branch. Second, we design a class-aware apex classification branch that distinguishes macro- and micro-expressions solely based on their pseudo-apex frames. During inference, the two branches work independently: the class-agnostic expression intensity branch generates expression proposals, while the class-aware apex-classification branch is responsible for macro- and micro-expression classification.Furthermore, we introduce an intensity-aware contrastive loss to enhance discriminative feature learning and suppress neutral noise by contrasting neutral frames with expression frames with various intensities. Extensive experiments on the SAMM-LV, CAS(ME)$^2$, and CAS(ME)$^3$ datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

TL;DR: STAR建模通过使用均匀生成树的遍历顺序，在保持采样性能的同时提供灵活的序列顺序，以支持图像编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自回归模型在视觉生成中采用随机排列序列顺序时，要么性能下降，要么在推理时序列顺序选择不灵活。STAR旨在解决这一问题。

Method: STAR利用图像块位置定义的格子中采样的均匀生成树的遍历顺序，通过广度优先搜索获得遍历顺序，并通过拒绝采样确保连接的部分观察作为序列前缀出现。

Result: STAR在保持采样性能的同时，提供了足够灵活的序列顺序来适应推理时的图像编辑，且无需对广泛采用的语言AR模型架构进行重大更改。

Conclusion: STAR通过定制但结构化的随机策略，相比随机排列，保持了后缀完成能力，同时维持了采样性能。

Abstract: We present Spanning Tree Autoregressive (STAR) modeling, which can incorporate prior knowledge of images, such as center bias and locality, to maintain sampling performance while also providing sufficiently flexible sequence orders to accommodate image editing at inference. Approaches that expose randomly permuted sequence orders to conventional autoregressive (AR) models in visual generation for bidirectional context either suffer from a decline in performance or compromise the flexibility in sequence order choice at inference. Instead, STAR utilizes traversal orders of uniform spanning trees sampled in a lattice defined by the positions of image patches. Traversal orders are obtained through breadth-first search, allowing us to efficiently construct a spanning tree whose traversal order ensures that the connected partial observation of the image appears as a prefix in the sequence through rejection sampling. Through the tailored yet structured randomized strategy compared to random permutation, STAR preserves the capability of postfix completion while maintaining sampling performance without any significant changes to the model architecture widely adopted in the language AR modeling.

Motivation: 现有SDE-based GRPO方法存在信用分配效率低和与高阶求解器不兼容的问题，限制了其在流匹配模型中的应用效果。

Conclusion: Neighbor GRPO成功解决了SDE-based GRPO的问题，完全保留了确定性ODE采样的优势，为流匹配模型的对齐提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has shown promise in aligning image and video generative models with human preferences. However, applying it to modern flow matching models is challenging because of its deterministic sampling paradigm. Current methods address this issue by converting Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) to Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs), which introduce stochasticity. However, this SDE-based GRPO suffers from issues of inefficient credit assignment and incompatibility with high-order solvers for fewer-step sampling. In this paper, we first reinterpret existing SDE-based GRPO methods from a distance optimization perspective, revealing their underlying mechanism as a form of contrastive learning. Based on this insight, we propose Neighbor GRPO, a novel alignment algorithm that completely bypasses the need for SDEs. Neighbor GRPO generates a diverse set of candidate trajectories by perturbing the initial noise conditions of the ODE and optimizes the model using a softmax distance-based surrogate leaping policy. We establish a theoretical connection between this distance-based objective and policy gradient optimization, rigorously integrating our approach into the GRPO framework. Our method fully preserves the advantages of deterministic ODE sampling, including efficiency and compatibility with high-order solvers. We further introduce symmetric anchor sampling for computational efficiency and group-wise quasi-norm reweighting to address reward flattening. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Neighbor GRPO significantly outperforms SDE-based counterparts in terms of training cost, convergence speed, and generation quality.

Conclusion: DMG-YOLO通过创新的模块设计有效提升了遥感图像中小目标的实时检测性能，在精度和效率之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Remote sensing imagery is widely used across various fields, yet real-time detection remains challenging due to the prevalence of small objects and the need to balance accuracy with efficiency. To address this, we propose DMG-YOLO, a lightweight real-time detector tailored for small object detection in remote sensing images. Specifically, we design a Dual-branch Feature Extraction (DFE) module in the backbone, which partitions feature maps into two parallel branches: one extracts local features via depthwise separable convolutions, and the other captures global context using a vision transformer with a gating mechanism. Additionally, a Multi-scale Feature Fusion (MFF) module with dilated convolutions enhances multi-scale integration while preserving fine details. In the neck, we introduce the Global and Local Aggregate Feature Pyramid Network (GLAFPN) to further boost small object detection through global-local feature fusion. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone2019 and NWPU VHR-10 datasets show that DMG-YOLO achieves competitive performance in terms of mAP, model size, and other key metrics.

Conclusion: MatPedia提供了一个统一框架，能够处理文本到材料生成、图像到材料生成和内在分解等多种材料任务，实现了高质量的材料合成。

Abstract: Physically-based rendering (PBR) materials are fundamental to photorealistic graphics, yet their creation remains labor-intensive and requires specialized expertise. While generative models have advanced material synthesis, existing methods lack a unified representation bridging natural image appearance and PBR properties, leading to fragmented task-specific pipelines and inability to leverage large-scale RGB image data. We present MatPedia, a foundation model built upon a novel joint RGB-PBR representation that compactly encodes materials into two interdependent latents: one for RGB appearance and one for the four PBR maps encoding complementary physical properties. By formulating them as a 5-frame sequence and employing video diffusion architectures, MatPedia naturally captures their correlations while transferring visual priors from RGB generation models. This joint representation enables a unified framework handling multiple material tasks--text-to-material generation, image-to-material generation, and intrinsic decomposition--within a single architecture. Trained on MatHybrid-410K, a mixed corpus combining PBR datasets with large-scale RGB images, MatPedia achieves native $1024\times1024$ synthesis that substantially surpasses existing approaches in both quality and diversity.

Conclusion: SING3R-SLAM通过全局一致的高斯表示有效解决了SLAM中的漂移和冗余问题，为多种下游应用提供了高效且紧凑的3D建图解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in dense 3D reconstruction enable the accurate capture of local geometry; however, integrating them into SLAM is challenging due to drift and redundant point maps, which limit efficiency and downstream tasks, such as novel view synthesis. To address these issues, we propose SING3R-SLAM, a globally consistent and compact Gaussian-based dense RGB SLAM framework. The key idea is to combine locally consistent 3D reconstructions with a unified global Gaussian representation that jointly refines scene geometry and camera poses, enabling efficient and versatile 3D mapping for multiple downstream applications. SING3R-SLAM first builds locally consistent submaps through our lightweight tracking and reconstruction module, and then progressively aligns and fuses them into a global Gaussian map that enforces cross-view geometric consistency. This global map, in turn, provides feedback to correct local drift and enhance the robustness of tracking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SING3R-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art tracking, 3D reconstruction, and novel view rendering, resulting in over 12% improvement in tracking and producing finer, more detailed geometry, all while maintaining a compact and memory-efficient global representation on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: 所提出的双分支退化提取网络能够有效处理盲超分问题，通过分别适应模糊和噪声退化实现了优异的性能。

Abstract: Previous methods have demonstrated remarkable performance in single image super-resolution (SISR) tasks with known and fixed degradation (e.g., bicubic downsampling). However, when the actual degradation deviates from these assumptions, these methods may experience significant declines in performance. In this paper, we propose a Dual Branch Degradation Extractor Network to address the blind SR problem. While some blind SR methods assume noise-free degradation and others do not explicitly consider the presence of noise in the degradation model, our approach predicts two unsupervised degradation embeddings that represent blurry and noisy information. The SR network can then be adapted to blur embedding and noise embedding in distinct ways. Furthermore, we treat the degradation extractor as a regularizer to capitalize on differences between SR and HR images. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate our method achieves SOTA performance in the blind SR problem.

Conclusion: LVLMs的幻觉问题源于多路径相互作用，且模型依赖的路径因问答格式而异，提出的干预方法能有效减少幻觉。

Abstract: Despite their impressive performance across a wide range of tasks, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) remain prone to hallucination. In this study, we propose a comprehensive intervention framework aligned with the transformer's causal architecture in LVLMs, integrating the effects of different intervention paths on hallucination. We find that hallucinations in LVLMs do not arise from a single causal path, but rather from the interplay among image-to-input-text, image-to-output-text, and text-to-text pathways. For the first time, we also find that LVLMs rely on different pathways depending on the question-answer alignment format. Building on these insights, we propose simple yet effective methods to identify and intervene on critical hallucination heads within each pathway, tailored to discriminative and generative formats. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces hallucinations across diverse alignment types.

Abstract: Learning 3D scene geometry and semantics from images is a core challenge in computer vision and a key capability for autonomous driving. Since large-scale 3D annotation is prohibitively expensive, recent work explores self-supervised learning directly from sensor data without manual labels. Existing approaches either rely on 2D rendering consistency, where 3D structure emerges only implicitly, or on discretized voxel grids from accumulated lidar point clouds, limiting spatial precision and scalability. We introduce QueryOcc, a query-based self-supervised framework that learns continuous 3D semantic occupancy directly through independent 4D spatio-temporal queries sampled across adjacent frames. The framework supports supervision from either pseudo-point clouds derived from vision foundation models or raw lidar data. To enable long-range supervision and reasoning under constant memory, we introduce a contractive scene representation that preserves near-field detail while smoothly compressing distant regions. QueryOcc surpasses previous camera-based methods by 26% in semantic RayIoU on the self-supervised Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark while running at 11.6 FPS, demonstrating that direct 4D query supervision enables strong self-supervised occupancy learning. https://research.zenseact.com/publications/queryocc/

Motivation: 在边缘设备上从原始食物图像合成逼真的烹饪完成图像是一个挑战性的生成任务，现有方法要么生成结果不真实，要么资源消耗过大不适合边缘部署。

Method: 构建首个基于烤箱的烹饪进度数据集，提出边缘高效的食谱和烹饪状态引导生成器，引入领域特定的烹饪图像相似度指标作为训练损失和进度监控信号。

Conclusion: 该方法能够根据用户偏好的视觉目标而非固定预设生成逼真的食物图像，确保了时间一致性和烹饪合理性。

Abstract: Synthesizing realistic cooked food images from raw inputs on edge devices is a challenging generative task, requiring models to capture complex changes in texture, color and structure during cooking. Existing image-to-image generation methods often produce unrealistic results or are too resource-intensive for edge deployment. We introduce the first oven-based cooking-progression dataset with chef-annotated doneness levels and propose an edge-efficient recipe and cooking state guided generator that synthesizes realistic food images conditioned on raw food image. This formulation enables user-preferred visual targets rather than fixed presets. To ensure temporal consistency and culinary plausibility, we introduce a domain-specific \textit{Culinary Image Similarity (CIS)} metric, which serves both as a training loss and a progress-monitoring signal. Our model outperforms existing baselines with significant reductions in FID scores (30\% improvement on our dataset; 60\% on public datasets)

Conclusion: 该方法为生成多样化LiDAR数据提供了成本效益高且可扩展的解决方案，有助于提升自动驾驶系统的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Training autonomous driving and navigation systems requires large and diverse point cloud datasets that capture complex edge case scenarios from various dynamic urban settings. Acquiring such diverse scenarios from real-world point cloud data, especially for critical edge cases, is challenging, which restricts system generalization and robustness. Current methods rely on simulating point cloud data within handcrafted 3D virtual environments, which is time-consuming, computationally expensive, and often fails to fully capture the complexity of real-world scenes. To address some of these issues, this research proposes a novel approach that addresses the problem discussed by editing real-world LiDAR scans using semantic mask-based guidance to generate novel synthetic LiDAR point clouds. We incorporate range image projection and semantic mask conditioning to achieve diffusion-based generation. Point clouds are transformed to 2D range view images, which are used as an intermediate representation to enable semantic editing using convex hull-based semantic masks. These masks guide the generation process by providing information on the dimensions, orientations, and locations of objects in the real environment, ensuring geometric consistency and realism. This approach demonstrates high-quality LiDAR point cloud generation, capable of producing complex edge cases and dynamic scenes, as validated on the KITTI-360 dataset. This offers a cost-effective and scalable solution for generating diverse LiDAR data, a step toward improving the robustness of autonomous driving systems.

Motivation: 3DGS使用大量高斯基元拟合场景，导致存储和计算开销巨大。现有剪枝方法依赖人工设计标准或引入额外可学习参数，效果不佳。

Method: 提出自然选择启发的剪枝框架，将生存压力建模为不透明度的正则化梯度场；引入具有有限不透明度先验的不透明度衰减技术，加速选择过程。

Result: 与3DGS相比，在15%预算下获得超过0.6 dB的PSNR增益，在紧凑3DGS方面达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了完全可学习的剪枝过程，无需人工干预，在保持渲染质量的同时显著减少了存储和计算开销。

Abstract: 3DGS employs a large number of Gaussian primitives to fit scenes, resulting in substantial storage and computational overhead. Existing pruning methods rely on manually designed criteria or introduce additional learnable parameters, yielding suboptimal results. To address this, we propose an natural selection inspired pruning framework that models survival pressure as a regularization gradient field applied to opacity, allowing the optimization gradients--driven by the goal of maximizing rendering quality--to autonomously determine which Gaussians to retain or prune. This process is fully learnable and requires no human intervention. We further introduce an opacity decay technique with a finite opacity prior, which accelerates the selection process without compromising pruning effectiveness. Compared to 3DGS, our method achieves over 0.6 dB PSNR gain under 15\% budgets, establishing state-of-the-art performance for compact 3DGS. Project page https://xiaobin2001.github.io/GNS-web.

TL;DR: 当前多语言文本到图像模型存在文化偏差问题，本文提出通过定位文化敏感神经元和两种对齐策略来改善多语言提示下的文化一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言T2I模型在视觉真实性和语义对齐方面进展迅速，但由于语言承载文化内涵，多语言提示生成的图像应保持跨语言文化一致性，而现有模型往往产生文化中立或英语偏见的结果。

Method: 提出探测方法定位文化敏感信号到少量固定层的神经元，并引入两种对齐策略：推理时文化激活（放大已识别神经元）和层定向文化增强（仅更新文化相关层）。

Result: 在CultureBench上的实验表明，相比强基线方法，在文化一致性方面获得持续改进，同时保持保真度和多样性。

Conclusion: 通过定位文化敏感神经元和针对性对齐策略，可以有效提升多语言T2I模型的文化一致性，而问题根源在于文化相关表征激活不足而非知识缺失。

Abstract: Multilingual text-to-image (T2I) models have advanced rapidly in terms of visual realism and semantic alignment, and are now widely utilized. Yet outputs vary across cultural contexts: because language carries cultural connotations, images synthesized from multilingual prompts should preserve cross-lingual cultural consistency. We conduct a comprehensive analysis showing that current T2I models often produce culturally neutral or English-biased results under multilingual prompts. Analyses of two representative models indicate that the issue stems not from missing cultural knowledge but from insufficient activation of culture-related representations. We propose a probing method that localizes culture-sensitive signals to a small set of neurons in a few fixed layers. Guided by this finding, we introduce two complementary alignment strategies: (1) inference-time cultural activation that amplifies the identified neurons without backbone fine-tuned; and (2) layer-targeted cultural enhancement that updates only culturally relevant layers. Experiments on our CultureBench demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines in cultural consistency while preserving fidelity and diversity.

Result: SQ指标显著改进了集成模型选择，提升了植物病害检测的准确率，实验证明该指标与集成准确率保持一致。

Abstract: Plant diseases pose a significant threat to global agriculture, causing over $220 billion in annual economic losses and jeopardizing food security. The timely and accurate detection of these diseases from plant leaf images is critical to mitigating their adverse effects. Deep neural network Ensembles (Deep Ensembles) have emerged as a powerful approach to enhancing prediction accuracy by leveraging the strengths of diverse Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, selecting high-performing ensemble member models is challenging due to the inherent difficulty in measuring ensemble diversity. In this paper, we introduce the Synergistic Diversity (SQ) framework to enhance plant disease detection accuracy. First, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the limitations of existing ensemble diversity metrics (denoted as Q metrics), which often fail to identify optimal ensemble teams. Second, we present the SQ metric, a novel measure that captures the synergy between ensemble members and consistently aligns with ensemble accuracy. Third, we validate our SQ approach through extensive experiments on a plant leaf image dataset, which demonstrates that our SQ metric substantially improves ensemble selection and enhances detection accuracy. Our findings pave the way for a more reliable and efficient image-based plant disease detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督学习方法主要针对语义理解而非几何推理，CroCo虽然针对3D理解但仍有改进空间，需要更简单可扩展的方法学习3D视觉特征。

Method: 将MAE扩展到任意多视角图像，对所有视图进行统一掩码，使用轻量级解码器和帧间注意力机制。

Result: 在重建、密集图像匹配和相对姿态估计等下游任务中，MuM超越了DINOv3和CroCo v2等最先进的视觉编码器。

Conclusion: MuM提供了一种更简单、可扩展的多视角自监督学习方法，在3D视觉任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning on images seeks to extract meaningful visual representations from unlabeled data. When scaled to large datasets, this paradigm has achieved state-of-the-art performance and the resulting trained models such as DINOv3 have seen widespread adoption. However, most prior efforts are optimized for semantic understanding rather than geometric reasoning. One important exception is Cross-View Completion, CroCo, which is a form of masked autoencoding (MAE) tailored for 3D understanding. In this work, we continue on the path proposed by CroCo and focus on learning features tailored for 3D vision. In a nutshell, we extend MAE to arbitrarily many views of the same scene. By uniformly masking all views and employing a lightweight decoder with inter-frame attention, our approach is inherently simpler and more scalable than CroCo. We evaluate the resulting model, MuM, extensively on downstream tasks including feedforward reconstruction, dense image matching and relative pose estimation, finding that it outperforms the state-of-the-art visual encoders DINOv3 and CroCo v2.

Conclusion: RadioKMoE框架通过结合KAN和MoE的优势，能够有效提升无线信号覆盖图估计的精度和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Radiomap serves as a vital tool for wireless network management and deployment by providing powerful spatial knowledge of signal propagation and coverage. However, increasingly complex radio propagation behavior and surrounding environments pose strong challenges for radiomap estimation (RME). In this work, we propose a knowledge-guided RME framework that integrates Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), namely RadioKMoE. Specifically, we design a KAN module to predict an initial coarse coverage map, leveraging KAN's strength in approximating physics models and global radio propagation patterns. The initial coarse map, together with environmental information, drives our MoE network for precise radiomap estimation. Unlike conventional deep learning models, the MoE module comprises expert networks specializing in distinct radiomap patterns to improve local details while preserving global consistency. Experimental results in both multi- and single-band RME demonstrate the enhanced accuracy and robustness of the proposed RadioKMoE in radiomap estimation.

Motivation: 探索是否仅使用视觉特征就能准确预测图像复杂度，挑战现有依赖多模态（视觉+语言）的方法的必要性。

Method: 提出DReX模型，通过可学习的注意力机制融合ResNet-50的多尺度层次特征和DINOv3 ViT-S/16的语义丰富表示，捕捉低层纹理模式和高层语义结构。

Result: 在IC9600基准测试中达到Pearson r=0.9581的最先进性能，超越多模态方法，参数量减少约21.5倍，在多个数据集和指标上表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 视觉特征足以进行人类对齐的复杂度预测，自监督transformer和监督卷积神经网络在适当融合时能提供互补和协同优势。

Abstract: Visual complexity prediction is a fundamental problem in computer vision with applications in image compression, retrieval, and classification. Understanding what makes humans perceive an image as complex is also a long-standing question in cognitive science. Recent approaches have leveraged multimodal models that combine visual and linguistic representations, but it remains unclear whether language information is necessary for this task. We propose DReX (DINO-ResNet Fusion), a vision-only model that fuses self-supervised and convolutional representations through a learnable attention mechanism to predict image complexity. Our architecture integrates multi-scale hierarchical features from ResNet-50 with semantically rich representations from DINOv3 ViT-S/16, enabling the model to capture both low-level texture patterns and high-level semantic structure. DReX achieves state-of-the-art performance on the IC9600 benchmark (Pearson r = 0.9581), surpassing previous methods--including those trained on multimodal image-text data--while using approximately 21.5x fewer learnable parameters. Furthermore, DReX generalizes robustly across multiple datasets and metrics, achieving superior results on Pearson and Spearman correlation, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Ablation and attention analyses confirm that DReX leverages complementary cues from both backbones, with the DINOv3 [CLS] token enhancing sensitivity to visual complexity. Our findings suggest that visual features alone can be sufficient for human-aligned complexity prediction and that, when properly fused, self-supervised transformers and supervised deep convolutional neural networks offer complementary and synergistic benefits for this task.

Abstract: Face verification is a significant component of identity authentication in various applications including online banking and secure access to personal devices. The majority of the existing face image datasets often suffer from notable biases related to race, gender, and other demographic characteristics, limiting the effectiveness and fairness of face verification systems. In response to these challenges, we propose a comprehensive methodology that integrates advanced generative models to create varied and diverse high-quality synthetic face images. This methodology emphasizes the representation of a diverse range of facial traits, ensuring adherence to characteristics permissible in identity card photographs. Furthermore, we introduce the Diverse and Inclusive Faces for Verification (DIF-V) dataset, comprising 27,780 images of 926 unique identities, designed as a benchmark for future research in face verification. Our analysis reveals that existing verification models exhibit biases toward certain genders and races, and notably, applying identity style modifications negatively impacts model performance. By tackling the inherent inequities in existing datasets, this work not only enriches the discussion on diversity and ethics in artificial intelligence but also lays the foundation for developing more inclusive and reliable face verification technologies

Motivation: 现实世界中的深度很少是单一的，透射材料会产生分层模糊，混淆传统感知系统。现有模型被动估计静态深度图，而人类能够主动调整焦点来感知所需深度。

Method: 引入DepthFocus，一个可操纵的视觉Transformer，通过标量深度偏好进行条件化，动态调整计算以聚焦于目标深度。训练主要使用新构建的50万多层合成数据集，捕捉多样的透视效果。

Conclusion: DepthFocus是迈向主动和类人3D感知的重要一步，展示了在复杂场景中进行选择性感知的能力。

Abstract: Depth in the real world is rarely singular. Transmissive materials create layered ambiguities that confound conventional perception systems. Existing models remain passive, attempting to estimate static depth maps anchored to the nearest surface, while humans actively shift focus to perceive a desired depth. We introduce DepthFocus, a steerable Vision Transformer that redefines stereo depth estimation as intent-driven control. Conditioned on a scalar depth preference, the model dynamically adapts its computation to focus on the intended depth, enabling selective perception within complex scenes. The training primarily leverages our newly constructed 500k multi-layered synthetic dataset, designed to capture diverse see-through effects. DepthFocus not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on conventional single-depth benchmarks like BOOSTER, a dataset notably rich in transparent and reflective objects, but also quantitatively demonstrates intent-aligned estimation on our newly proposed real and synthetic multi-depth datasets. Moreover, it exhibits strong generalization capabilities on unseen see-through scenes, underscoring its robustness as a significant step toward active and human-like 3D perception.

Conclusion: MoE-ViT是多通道图像处理中实用且具有吸引力的骨干网络，能够在不牺牲性能的情况下大幅提升计算效率。

Abstract: Vision Transformers ($\text{ViTs}$) have become the backbone of vision foundation models, yet their optimization for multi-channel domains - such as cell painting or satellite imagery - remains underexplored. A key challenge in these domains is capturing interactions between channels, as each channel carries different information. While existing works have shown efficacy by treating each channel independently during tokenization, this approach naturally introduces a major computational bottleneck in the attention block - channel-wise comparisons leads to a quadratic growth in attention, resulting in excessive $\text{FLOPs}$ and high training cost. In this work, we shift focus from efficacy to the overlooked efficiency challenge in cross-channel attention and ask: "Is it necessary to model all channel interactions?". Inspired by the philosophy of Sparse Mixture-of-Experts ($\text{MoE}$), we propose MoE-ViT, a Mixture-of-Experts architecture for multi-channel images in $\text{ViTs}$, which treats each channel as an expert and employs a lightweight router to select only the most relevant experts per patch for attention. Proof-of-concept experiments on real-world datasets - JUMP-CP and So2Sat - demonstrate that $\text{MoE-ViT}$ achieves substantial efficiency gains without sacrificing, and in some cases enhancing, performance, making it a practical and attractive backbone for multi-channel imaging.

Abstract: Reliable visual perception under adverse weather conditions, such as rain, haze, snow, or a mixture of them, is desirable yet challenging for autonomous driving and outdoor robots. In this paper, we propose a unified Memory-Enhanced Visual-Language Recovery (MVLR) model that restores images from different degradation levels under various weather conditions. MVLR couples a lightweight encoder-decoder backbone with a Visual-Language Model (VLM) and an Implicit Memory Bank (IMB). The VLM performs chain-of-thought inference to encode weather degradation priors and the IMB stores continuous latent representations of degradation patterns. The VLM-generated priors query the IMB to retrieve fine-grained degradation prototypes. These prototypes are then adaptively fused with multi-scale visual features via dynamic cross-attention mechanisms, enhancing restoration accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on four severe-weather benchmarks show that MVLR surpasses single-branch and Mixture-of-Experts baselines in terms of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM). These results indicate that MVLR offers a practical balance between model compactness and expressiveness for real-time deployment in diverse outdoor conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型容易学习训练数据中伪相关但无关特征的捷径解决方案，在医学图像分析等高风险应用中，这可能导致模型不使用临床有意义的特征，造成鲁棒性差和患者伤害。

Method: 利用在小型任务相关数据子集上微调的教师网络，通过知识蒸馏框架来缓解在包含偏差特征的大型数据集上训练的学生网络中的捷径学习问题。

Result: 在CheXpert、ISIC 2017和SimBA数据集上使用多种架构进行广泛实验，相比传统经验风险最小化、基于增强的偏差缓解和基于组的偏差缓解方法，取得了持续改进。在许多情况下，即使在分布外测试数据上，也能达到与在无偏差数据上训练的基线模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在真实世界医学成像场景中具有实际适用性，特别是在偏差标注有限且捷径特征难以先验识别的情况下。

Abstract: Deep learning models are prone to learning shortcut solutions to problems using spuriously correlated yet irrelevant features of their training data. In high-risk applications such as medical image analysis, this phenomenon may prevent models from using clinically meaningful features when making predictions, potentially leading to poor robustness and harm to patients. We demonstrate that different types of shortcuts (those that are diffuse and spread throughout the image, as well as those that are localized to specific areas) manifest distinctly across network layers and can, therefore, be more effectively targeted through mitigation strategies that target the intermediate layers. We propose a novel knowledge distillation framework that leverages a teacher network fine-tuned on a small subset of task-relevant data to mitigate shortcut learning in a student network trained on a large dataset corrupted with a bias feature. Through extensive experiments on CheXpert, ISIC 2017, and SimBA datasets using various architectures (ResNet-18, AlexNet, DenseNet-121, and 3D CNNs), we demonstrate consistent improvements over traditional Empirical Risk Minimization, augmentation-based bias-mitigation, and group-based bias-mitigation approaches. In many cases, we achieve comparable performance with a baseline model trained on bias-free data, even on out-of-distribution test data. Our results demonstrate the practical applicability of our approach to real-world medical imaging scenarios where bias annotations are limited and shortcut features are difficult to identify a priori.

Motivation: 现有评估通常每个图像只包含单一文化概念，忽视了多个可能不相关的文化线索共存的场景。需要测试VLM在不同文化输入下的稳定性，以支持多样性和多元文化社会。

Method: 引入ConfusedTourist套件，通过简单的图像堆叠扰动和基于图像生成的变体来评估VLM的文化对抗鲁棒性。进行可解释性分析，观察模型注意力转移。

Abstract: Although the cultural dimension has been one of the key aspects in evaluating Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their ability to remain stable across diverse cultural inputs remains largely untested, despite being crucial to support diversity and multicultural societies. Existing evaluations often rely on benchmarks featuring only a singular cultural concept per image, overlooking scenarios where multiple, potentially unrelated cultural cues coexist. To address this gap, we introduce ConfusedTourist, a novel cultural adversarial robustness suite designed to assess VLMs' stability against perturbed geographical cues. Our experiments reveal a critical vulnerability, where accuracy drops heavily under simple image-stacking perturbations and even worsens with its image-generation-based variant. Interpretability analyses further show that these failures stem from systematic attention shifts toward distracting cues, diverting the model from its intended focus. These findings highlight a critical challenge: visual cultural concept mixing can substantially impair even state-of-the-art VLMs, underscoring the urgent need for more culturally robust multimodal understanding.

Motivation: 遥感基础模型选择困难，因为文档分散、格式异构、部署约束多样。需要系统化的解决方案来帮助用户选择合适的模型。

Method: 构建RSFM数据库(RS-FMD)覆盖150多个模型，开发REMSA智能体使用LLM解释用户需求、补全缺失约束、排名候选模型并提供解释。

Result: REMSA在75个专家验证的查询场景中表现优于基线方法，包括朴素智能体、密集检索和非结构化RAG方法。

Conclusion: REMSA是首个基于LLM的遥感基础模型自动选择智能体，完全基于公开元数据运行，不访问私有敏感数据，为遥感领域提供了实用的模型选择工具。

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) are increasingly used in remote sensing (RS) for tasks such as environmental monitoring, disaster assessment, and land-use mapping. These models include unimodal vision encoders trained on a single data modality and multimodal architectures trained on combinations of SAR, multispectral, hyperspectral, and image-text data. They support diverse RS tasks including semantic segmentation, image classification, change detection, and visual question answering. However, selecting an appropriate remote sensing foundation model (RSFM) remains difficult due to scattered documentation, heterogeneous formats, and varied deployment constraints. We introduce the RSFM Database (RS-FMD), a structured resource covering over 150 RSFMs spanning multiple data modalities, resolutions, and learning paradigms. Built on RS-FMD, we present REMSA, the first LLM-based agent for automated RSFM selection from natural language queries. REMSA interprets user requirements, resolves missing constraints, ranks candidate models using in-context learning, and provides transparent justifications. We also propose a benchmark of 75 expert-verified RS query scenarios, producing 900 configurations under an expert-centered evaluation protocol. REMSA outperforms several baselines, including naive agents, dense retrieval, and unstructured RAG-based LLMs. It operates entirely on publicly available metadata and does not access private or sensitive data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成方法使用单次规划或迭代优化，前者运动简单，后者计算成本高。需要一种既能生成复杂运动又高效的方法。

Method: 通过预测多个候选运动轨迹，使用视觉语言验证器评估语义对齐和物理合理性，将轨迹渲染为轻量级视频草图进行评分，迭代优化直到找到满意轨迹。

Result: 在WorldModelBench和PhyWorldBench上的实验表明，该方法显著提高了运动质量、物理真实性和长期一致性，同时效率更高。

Conclusion: SketchVerify框架通过草图验证机制有效提升了运动规划质量，且扩展候选轨迹数量能持续提升性能。

Abstract: Recent video generation approaches increasingly rely on planning intermediate control signals such as object trajectories to improve temporal coherence and motion fidelity. However, these methods mostly employ single-shot plans that are typically limited to simple motions, or iterative refinement which requires multiple calls to the video generator, incuring high computational cost. To overcome these limitations, we propose SketchVerify, a training-free, sketch-verification-based planning framework that improves motion planning quality with more dynamically coherent trajectories (i.e., physically plausible and instruction-consistent motions) prior to full video generation by introducing a test-time sampling and verification loop. Given a prompt and a reference image, our method predicts multiple candidate motion plans and ranks them using a vision-language verifier that jointly evaluates semantic alignment with the instruction and physical plausibility. To efficiently score candidate motion plans, we render each trajectory as a lightweight video sketch by compositing objects over a static background, which bypasses the need for expensive, repeated diffusion-based synthesis while achieving comparable performance. We iteratively refine the motion plan until a satisfactory one is identified, which is then passed to the trajectory-conditioned generator for final synthesis. Experiments on WorldModelBench and PhyWorldBench demonstrate that our method significantly improves motion quality, physical realism, and long-term consistency compared to competitive baselines while being substantially more efficient. Our ablation study further shows that scaling up the number of trajectory candidates consistently enhances overall performance.

Motivation: 解决传统3D室内场景生成需要大量手动布局设计或全景图像指导的问题，实现仅通过简短文本描述就能自动生成合理布局的3D室内场景。

Method: 使用分层语言驱动代理规划器解析文本提示为详细场景描述，通过两个排列约束迭代优化空间布局，最后采用AnyReach采样策略和ITFS策略优化3D高斯场景表示。

Conclusion: RoomPlanner框架成功实现了仅通过文本输入自动生成高质量3D室内场景的目标，在效率和质量方面均表现出色，为3D场景生成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose RoomPlanner, the first fully automatic 3D room generation framework for painlessly creating realistic indoor scenes with only short text as input. Without any manual layout design or panoramic image guidance, our framework can generate explicit layout criteria for rational spatial placement. We begin by introducing a hierarchical structure of language-driven agent planners that can automatically parse short and ambiguous prompts into detailed scene descriptions. These descriptions include raw spatial and semantic attributes for each object and the background, which are then used to initialize 3D point clouds. To position objects within bounded environments, we implement two arrangement constraints that iteratively optimize spatial arrangements, ensuring a collision-free and accessible layout solution. In the final rendering stage, we propose a novel AnyReach Sampling strategy for camera trajectory, along with the Interval Timestep Flow Sampling (ITFS) strategy, to efficiently optimize the coarse 3D Gaussian scene representation. These approaches help reduce the total generation time to under 30 minutes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can produce geometrically rational 3D indoor scenes, surpassing prior approaches in both rendering speed and visual quality while preserving editability. The code will be available soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有计算流程缺乏明确的推理轨迹，导致预测不透明且不可解释。需要模拟病理学家动态缩放、重新聚焦和自我纠正的证据驱动推理过程。

Method: 使用三个模块：导航器迭代精确定位重要微区域，感知器提取形态学视觉线索，执行器将这些发现整合到持续演变的自然语言轨迹中，形成明确的思维链。

Result: 在五个具有挑战性的数据集上评估，PathAgent表现出强大的零样本泛化能力，在开放性和约束性视觉问答任务中超越特定任务基线。

Conclusion: PathAgent作为透明且临床基础的诊断助手具有前景，与人类病理学家的协作评估证实了其价值。

Abstract: Analyzing whole-slide images (WSIs) requires an iterative, evidence-driven reasoning process that parallels how pathologists dynamically zoom, refocus, and self-correct while collecting the evidence. However, existing computational pipelines often lack this explicit reasoning trajectory, resulting in inherently opaque and unjustifiable predictions. To bridge this gap, we present PathAgent, a training-free, large language model (LLM)-based agent framework that emulates the reflective, stepwise analytical approach of human experts. PathAgent can autonomously explore WSI, iteratively and precisely locating significant micro-regions using the Navigator module, extracting morphology visual cues using the Perceptor, and integrating these findings into the continuously evolving natural language trajectories in the Executor. The entire sequence of observations and decisions forms an explicit chain-of-thought, yielding fully interpretable predictions. Evaluated across five challenging datasets, PathAgent exhibits strong zero-shot generalization, surpassing task-specific baselines in both open-ended and constrained visual question-answering tasks. Moreover, a collaborative evaluation with human pathologists confirms PathAgent's promise as a transparent and clinically grounded diagnostic assistant.

Motivation: 现有的点云补全模型（包括基于transformer、去噪等方法）虽然能从部分输入生成全局合理的形状，但常常存在局部几何不一致的问题。

Method: 使用强化学习框架在预训练点自编码器的潜在空间中进行优化，通过RL代理调整全局特征向量，并采用轻量级非参数PointNN选择器评估几何一致性，保留更好的重建结果。

Result: 在ShapeNetCore-2048上的实验表明，RL-AD-Net在随机裁剪场景下表现优于基线方法，在各种设置下都能提供一致的改进。

Conclusion: 该方法是轻量级、模块化且模型无关的，适用于广泛的补全网络而无需重新训练，展示了RL引导的集成优化的有效性。

Abstract: Recent point cloud completion models, including transformer-based, denoising-based, and other state-of-the-art approaches, generate globally plausible shapes from partial inputs but often leave local geometric inconsistencies. We propose RL-AD-Net, a reinforcement learning (RL) refinement framework that operates in the latent space of a pretrained point autoencoder. The autoencoder encodes completions into compact global feature vectors (GFVs), which are selectively adjusted by an RL agent to improve geometric fidelity. To ensure robustness, a lightweight non-parametric PointNN selector evaluates the geometric consistency of both the original completion and the RL-refined output, retaining the better reconstruction. When ground truth is available, both Chamfer Distance and geometric consistency metrics guide refinement. Training is performed separately per category, since the unsupervised and dynamic nature of RL makes convergence across highly diverse categories challenging. Nevertheless, the framework can be extended to multi-category refinement in future work. Experiments on ShapeNetCore-2048 demonstrate that while baseline completion networks perform reasonable under their training-style cropping, they struggle in random cropping scenarios. In contrast, RL-AD-Net consistently delivers improvements across both settings, highlighting the effectiveness of RL-guided ensemble refinement. The approach is lightweight, modular, and model-agnostic, making it applicable to a wide range of completion networks without requiring retraining.

Abstract: Articulated objects are pervasive in daily environments, such as drawers and refrigerators. Towards their part-level surface reconstruction and joint parameter estimation, REArtGS~\cite{wu2025reartgs} introduces a category-agnostic approach using multi-view RGB images at two different states. However, we observe that REArtGS still struggles with screw-joint or multi-part objects and lacks geometric constraints for unseen states. In this paper, we propose REArtGS++, a novel method towards generalizable articulated object reconstruction with temporal geometry constraint and planar Gaussian splatting. We first model a decoupled screw motion for each joint without type prior, and jointly optimize part-aware Gaussians with joint parameters through part motion blending. To introduce time-continuous geometric constraint for articulated modeling, we encourage Gaussians to be planar and propose a temporally consistent regularization between planar normal and depth through Taylor first-order expansion. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world articulated objects demonstrate our superiority in generalizable part-level surface reconstruction and joint parameter estimation, compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models have recently garnered significant attention for their innovative next-scale prediction paradigm, offering notable advantages in both inference efficiency and image quality compared to traditional multi-step autoregressive (AR) and diffusion models. However, despite their efficiency, VAR models often suffer from the diversity collapse i.e., a reduction in output variability, analogous to that observed in few-step distilled diffusion models. In this paper, we introduce DiverseVAR, a simple yet effective approach that restores the generative diversity of VAR models without requiring any additional training. Our analysis reveals the pivotal component of the feature map as a key factor governing diversity formation at early scales. By suppressing the pivotal component in the model input and amplifying it in the model output, DiverseVAR effectively unlocks the inherent generative potential of VAR models while preserving high-fidelity synthesis. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach substantially enhances generative diversity with only neglectable performance influences. Our code will be publicly released at https://github.com/wangtong627/DiverseVAR.

Abstract: Articulated objects are ubiquitous in daily environments, and their 3D reconstruction holds great significance across various fields. However, existing articulated object reconstruction methods typically require costly inputs such as multi-stage and multi-view observations. To address the limitations, we propose a category-agnostic articulated object reconstruction framework via planar Gaussian Splatting, which only uses sparse-view RGB images from a single state. Specifically, we first introduce a Gaussian information field to perceive the optimal sparse viewpoints from candidate camera poses. Then we compress 3D Gaussians into planar Gaussians to facilitate accurate estimation of normal and depth. The planar Gaussians are optimized in a coarse-to-fine manner through depth smooth regularization and few-shot diffusion. Moreover, we introduce a part segmentation probability for each Gaussian primitive and update them by back-projecting part segmentation masks of renderings. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves higher-fidelity part-level surface reconstruction on both synthetic and real-world data than existing methods. Codes will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) plays a vital role in real-world applications such as security surveillance, autonomous driving, and industrial monitoring. Recent advances in large pre-trained models have opened new opportunities for training-free VAD by leveraging rich prior knowledge and general reasoning capabilities. However, existing studies typically rely on dense frame-level inference, incurring high computational costs and latency. This raises a fundamental question: Is dense reasoning truly necessary when using powerful pre-trained models in VAD systems? To answer this, we propose ReCoVAD, a novel framework inspired by the dual reflex and conscious pathways of the human nervous system, enabling selective frame processing to reduce redundant computation. ReCoVAD consists of two core pathways: (i) a Reflex pathway that uses a lightweight CLIP-based module to fuse visual features with prototype prompts and produce decision vectors, which query a dynamic memory of past frames and anomaly scores for fast response; and (ii) a Conscious pathway that employs a medium-scale vision-language model to generate textual event descriptions and refined anomaly scores for novel frames. It continuously updates the memory and prototype prompts, while an integrated large language model periodically reviews accumulated descriptions to identify unseen anomalies, correct errors, and refine prototypes. Extensive experiments show that ReCoVAD achieves state-of-the-art training-free performance while processing only 28.55\% and 16.04\% of the frames used by previous methods on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets, demonstrating that sparse reasoning is sufficient for effective large-model-based VAD.

Conclusion: 从预训练文本模型借用知识可以有效增强视觉模型的情感感知能力，PACL方法在视觉情感识别任务中取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Visual emotion recognition (VER) is a longstanding field that has garnered increasing attention with the advancement of deep neural networks. Although recent studies have achieved notable improvements by leveraging the knowledge embedded within pre-trained visual models, the lack of direct association between factual-level features and emotional categories, called the "affective gap", limits the applicability of pre-training knowledge for VER tasks. On the contrary, the explicit emotional expression and high information density in textual modality eliminate the "affective gap". Therefore, we propose borrowing the knowledge from the pre-trained textual model to enhance the emotional perception of pre-trained visual models. We focus on the factual and emotional connections between images and texts in noisy social media data, and propose Partitioned Adaptive Contrastive Learning (PACL) to leverage these connections. Specifically, we manage to separate different types of samples and devise distinct contrastive learning strategies for each type. By dynamically constructing negative and positive pairs, we fully exploit the potential of noisy samples. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that bridging the "affective gap" significantly improves the performance of various pre-trained visual models in downstream emotion-related tasks. Our code is released on https://github.com/wdqqdw/PACL.

Motivation: 现有多模态推理模型在生成长推理链时存在冗余自反思问题，而基于静态视觉参考的CoT压缩方法对多模态推理增益有限。

Method: ChainV首先基于前一步推理进行粗略视觉补丁选择，然后通过平均注意力强度识别最具代表性的原子视觉提示，并引入一致性评估机制来调整自反思程度。

Result: 在MathVista基准测试中准确率提升2.3%，推理延迟降低51.4%，输出token长度缩短24.5%。

Conclusion: ChainV通过动态整合视觉提示显著提高了多模态推理的准确性和效率，特别是在数学密集型任务中效果显著。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal reasoning models have demonstrated impressive capabilities across text and vision. However, even leading models exhibit redundant self-reflection when generating lengthy reasoning chains. While training-free CoT compression methods have emerged in the LLMs domain, they rely on static visual references and thus provide limited gains for multimodal reasoning. Therefore, we propose ChainV, a framework that dynamically integrates visual hints into the reasoning process, thereby making multimodal reasoning shorter and better. Specifically, ChainV first performs a coarse visual patch selection based on the previous reasoning step, then refines it by identifying the most representative atomic visual hint according to the averaged attention intensity. Additionally, ChainV introduces a consistency-based evaluation mechanism to assess the reliability of the chosen hint, guiding the model to adaptively adjust its level of self-reflection. Eventually, the pixel coordinates of the selected visual hint and its reliability are incorporated into thinking with a Bernoulli stochastic process. Experiments indicate that our method significantly improves reasoning accuracy and efficiency, especially on math-intensive benchmarks where visual hints are crucial for multi-step symbolic reasoning. For example, ChainV achieves $2.3\%$ improvement on the MathVista within MIMO-VL-RL, while reducing inference latency by $51.4\%$ and shortening output token length by $24.5\%$.

Abstract: Reconstruction of rigid motion over large spatiotemporal scales remains a challenging task due to limitations in modeling paradigms, severe motion blur, and insufficient physical consistency. In this work, we propose PEGS, a framework that integrates Physical priors with Event stream enhancement within a 3D Gaussian Splatting pipeline to perform deblurred target-focused modeling and motion recovery. We introduce a cohesive triple-level supervision scheme that enforces physical plausibility via an acceleration constraint, leverages event streams for high-temporal resolution guidance, and employs a Kalman regularizer to fuse multi-source observations. Furthermore, we design a motion-aware simulated annealing strategy that adaptively schedules the training process based on real-time kinematic states. We also contribute the first RGB-Event paired dataset targeting natural, fast rigid motion across diverse scenarios. Experiments show PEGS's superior performance in reconstructing motion over large spatiotemporal scales compared to mainstream dynamic methods.

Conclusion: 2D色度空间结合MLP的方法显著提升了非普朗克光源下的色彩精度，具有实用性和兼容性优势。

Abstract: Traditional in-camera colorimetric mapping relies on correlated color temperature (CCT)-based interpolation between pre-calibrated transforms optimized for Planckian illuminants such as CIE A and D65. However, modern lighting technologies such as LEDs can deviate substantially from the Planckian locus, exposing the limitations of relying on conventional one-dimensional CCT for illumination characterization. This paper demonstrates that transitioning from 1D CCT (on the Planckian locus) to a 2D chromaticity space (off the Planckian locus) improves colorimetric accuracy across various mapping approaches. In addition, we replace conventional CCT interpolation with a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP) that leverages 2D chromaticity features for robust colorimetric mapping under non-Planckian illuminants. A lightbox-based calibration procedure incorporating representative LED sources is used to train our MLP. Validated across diverse LED lighting, our method reduces angular reproduction error by 22% on average in LED-lit scenes, maintains backward compatibility with traditional illuminants, accommodates multi-illuminant scenes, and supports real-time in-camera deployment with negligible additional computational cost.

Abstract: Deep learning-based image compression (LIC) has achieved state-of-the-art rate-distortion (RD) performance, yet deploying these models on resource-constrained FPGAs remains a major challenge. This work presents a complete, multi-stage optimization framework to bridge the gap between high-performance floating-point models and efficient, hardware-friendly integer-based implementations. First, we address the fundamental problem of quantization-induced performance degradation. We propose a Dynamic Range-Aware Quantization (DRAQ) method that uses statistically-calibrated activation clipping and a novel weight regularization scheme to counteract the effects of extreme data outliers and large dynamic ranges, successfully creating a high-fidelity 8-bit integer model. Second, building on this robust foundation, we introduce two hardware-aware optimization techniques tailored for FPGAs. A progressive mixed-precision search algorithm exploits FPGA flexibility to assign optimal, non-uniform bit-widths to each layer, minimizing complexity while preserving performance. Concurrently, a channel pruning method, adapted to work with the Generalized Divisive Normalization (GDN) layers common in LIC, removes model redundancy by eliminating inactive channels. Our comprehensive experiments show that the foundational DRAQ method reduces the BD-rate overhead of a GDN-based model from $30\%$ to $6.3\%$. The subsequent hardware-aware optimizations further reduce computational complexity by over $20\%$ with negligible impact on RD performance, yielding a final model that is both state-of-the-art in efficiency and superior in quality to existing FPGA-based LIC implementations.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) have demonstrated remarkable perceptual quality, yet the balance between fidelity and controllability remains a problem: multi-step diffusion-based methods suffer from generative diversity and randomness, resulting in low fidelity, while one-step methods lose control flexibility due to fidelity-specific finetuning. In this paper, we present ODTSR, a one-step diffusion transformer based on Qwen-Image that performs Real-ISR considering fidelity and controllability simultaneously: a newly introduced visual stream receives low-quality images (LQ) with adjustable noise (Control Noise), and the original visual stream receives LQs with consistent noise (Prior Noise), forming the Noise-hybrid Visual Stream (NVS) design. ODTSR further employs Fidelity-aware Adversarial Training (FAA) to enhance controllability and achieve one-step inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ODTSR not only achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on generic Real-ISR, but also enables prompt controllability on challenging scenarios such as real-world scene text image super-resolution (STISR) of Chinese characters without training on specific datasets.

TL;DR: CC-DiceCE损失函数基于CC-Metrics框架，相比传统Dice损失能更好地检测小病灶，提高召回率但略微增加假阳性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统医学图像分割损失函数（如Dice）对小病灶分割不足，因为小病灶的相对体积对总体损失贡献很小。

Method: 在nnU-Net框架中引入CC-DiceCE损失函数，并与现有的blob loss和DiceCE基线进行比较。

Result: CC-DiceCE损失提高了检测召回率，分割性能仅有轻微下降，但会产生稍多的假阳性。在多数据集研究中，CC-DiceCE通常优于blob loss。

Conclusion: CC-DiceCE损失函数能有效改善小病灶检测，在保持分割质量的同时提高召回率，是优于blob loss的解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional loss functions in medical image segmentation, such as Dice, often under-segment small lesions because their small relative volume contributes negligibly to the overall loss. To address this, instance-wise loss functions and metrics have been proposed to evaluate segmentation quality on a per-lesion basis. We introduce CC-DiceCE, a loss function based on the CC-Metrics framework, and compare it with the existing blob loss. Both are benchmarked against a DiceCE baseline within the nnU-Net framework, which provides a robust and standardized setup. We find that CC-DiceCE loss increases detection (recall) with minimal to no degradation in segmentation performance, albeit at the cost of slightly more false positives. Furthermore, our multi-dataset study shows that CC-DiceCE generally outperforms blob loss.

Abstract: Unlike discriminative approaches in autonomous driving that predict a fixed set of candidate trajectories of the ego vehicle, generative methods, such as diffusion models, learn the underlying distribution of future motion, enabling more flexible trajectory prediction. However, since these methods typically rely on denoising human-crafted trajectory anchors or random noise, there remains significant room for improvement. In this paper, we propose DiffRefiner, a novel two-stage trajectory prediction framework. The first stage uses a transformer-based Proposal Decoder to generate coarse trajectory predictions by regressing from sensor inputs using predefined trajectory anchors. The second stage applies a Diffusion Refiner that iteratively denoises and refines these initial predictions. In this way, we enhance the performance of diffusion-based planning by incorporating a discriminative trajectory proposal module, which provides strong guidance for the generative refinement process. Furthermore, we design a fine-grained denoising decoder to enhance scene compliance, enabling more accurate trajectory prediction through enhanced alignment with the surrounding environment. Experimental results demonstrate that DiffRefiner achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining 87.4 EPDMS on NAVSIM v2, and 87.1 DS along with 71.4 SR on Bench2Drive, thereby setting new records on both public benchmarks. The effectiveness of each component is validated via ablation studies as well.

Conclusion: UI-Styler通过类感知风格迁移有效解决了超声图像跨设备域偏移问题，为医学图像分析中的域适应提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The appearance of ultrasound images varies across acquisition devices, causing domain shifts that degrade the performance of fixed black-box downstream inference models when reused. To mitigate this issue, it is practical to develop unpaired image translation (UIT) methods that effectively align the statistical distributions between source and target domains, particularly under the constraint of a reused inference-blackbox setting. However, existing UIT approaches often overlook class-specific semantic alignment during domain adaptation, resulting in misaligned content-class mappings that can impair diagnostic accuracy. To address this limitation, we propose UI-Styler, a novel ultrasound-specific, class-aware image style transfer framework. UI-Styler leverages a pattern-matching mechanism to transfer texture patterns embedded in the target images onto source images while preserving the source structural content. In addition, we introduce a class-aware prompting strategy guided by pseudo labels of the target domain, which enforces accurate semantic alignment with diagnostic categories. Extensive experiments on ultrasound cross-device tasks demonstrate that UI-Styler consistently outperforms existing UIT methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in distribution distance and downstream tasks, such as classification and segmentation.

Abstract: Predicting wildfire risk is a reasoning-intensive spatial problem that requires the integration of visual, climatic, and geographic factors to infer continuous risk maps. Existing methods lack the causal reasoning and multimodal understanding required for reliable generalization. We introduce $\textbf{FireScope-Bench}$, a large-scale dataset and benchmark that couples Sentinel-2 imagery and climate data with expert-defined risk rasters across the USA, and real wildfire events in Europe for cross-continental evaluation. Building on this dataset, we propose $\textbf{FireScope}$, a VLM-based reasoning-to-generation framework that learns from both reinforcement learning and visual supervision to predict risk rasters with complementary reasoning traces. When trained in the USA and tested in Europe, $\textbf{FireScope}$ achieves substantial performance gains, while expert feedback and automated analysis confirm that its reasoning traces are faithful and semantically meaningful. Our findings demonstrate that reasoning can ground raster prediction models, improving both generalization and interpretability. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to (1) demonstrate that language-based reasoning can improve generalization in visual generation, (2) propose a high-resolution wildfire risk model that can be applied across continents, and (3) enable systematic studies of robust cross-continental generalization for multimodal fire risk models. We believe that $\textbf{FireScope-Bench}$ has the potential to serve as a foundation for advancing reasoning-driven, interpretable and generalizable spatial modeling. Data and source code will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督表征在视觉和语音任务中表现出色，但在音频-视觉深度伪造检测中的潜力尚未充分探索。现有工作要么孤立使用这些特征，要么将其嵌入复杂架构中。

Method: 系统评估自监督表征在多种模态（音频、视频、多模态）和领域（唇部运动、通用视觉内容）中的应用，从检测效果、可解释性和跨模态互补性三个维度进行分析。

Result: 大多数自监督特征能捕捉深度伪造相关信息且信息具有互补性，模型主要关注语义上有意义的区域而非虚假伪影，但无法在跨数据集上可靠泛化。

Conclusion: 自监督表征在深度伪造检测中既有前景又面临根本挑战：虽然能学习有意义的模式，但实现稳健的跨域性能仍然困难。

Abstract: Self-supervised representations excel at many vision and speech tasks, but their potential for audio-visual deepfake detection remains underexplored. Unlike prior work that uses these features in isolation or buried within complex architectures, we systematically evaluate them across modalities (audio, video, multimodal) and domains (lip movements, generic visual content). We assess three key dimensions: detection effectiveness, interpretability of encoded information, and cross-modal complementarity. We find that most self-supervised features capture deepfake-relevant information, and that this information is complementary. Moreover, models primarily attend to semantically meaningful regions rather than spurious artifacts. Yet none generalize reliably across datasets. This generalization failure likely stems from dataset characteristics, not from the features themselves latching onto superficial patterns. These results expose both the promise and fundamental challenges of self-supervised representations for deepfake detection: while they learn meaningful patterns, achieving robust cross-domain performance remains elusive.

Abstract: Traffic signboards are vital for road safety and intelligent transportation systems, enabling navigation and autonomous driving. Yet, recognizing traffic signs at night remains challenging due to visual noise and scarcity of public nighttime datasets. Despite advances in vision architectures, existing methods struggle with robustness under low illumination and fail to leverage complementary mutlimodal cues effectively. To overcome these limitations, firstly, we introduce INTSD, a large-scale dataset comprising street-level night-time images of traffic signboards collected across diverse regions of India. The dataset spans 41 traffic signboard classes captured under varying lighting and weather conditions, providing a comprehensive benchmark for both detection and classification tasks. To benchmark INTSD for night-time sign recognition, we conduct extensive evaluations using state-of-the-art detection and classification models. Secondly, we propose LENS-Net, which integrates an adaptive image enhancement detector for joint illumination correction and sign localization, followed by a structured multimodal CLIP-GCNN classifier that leverages cross-modal attention and graph-based reasoning for robust and semantically consistent recognition. Our method surpasses existing frameworks, with ablation studies confirming the effectiveness of its key components. The dataset and code for LENS-Net is publicly available for research.

Conclusion: PostCam通过统一的特征表示和两阶段训练策略，显著提升了动态场景中相机轨迹编辑的精度和生成视频的视觉质量。

Abstract: We propose PostCam, a framework for novel-view video generation that enables post-capture editing of camera trajectories in dynamic scenes. We find that existing video recapture methods suffer from suboptimal camera motion injection strategies; such suboptimal designs not only limit camera control precision but also result in generated videos that fail to preserve fine visual details from the source video. To achieve more accurate and flexible motion manipulation, PostCam introduces a query-shared cross-attention module. It integrates two distinct forms of control signals: the 6-DoF camera poses and the 2D rendered video frames. By fusing them into a unified representation within a shared feature space, our model can extract underlying motion cues, which enhances both control precision and generation quality. Furthermore, we adopt a two-stage training strategy: the model first learns coarse camera control from pose inputs, and then incorporates visual information to refine motion accuracy and enhance visual fidelity. Experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that PostCam outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 20% in camera control precision and view consistency, while achieving the highest video generation quality.

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising is a crucial step in enhancing the quality of HSIs. Noise modeling methods can fit noise distributions to generate synthetic HSIs to train denoising networks. However, the noise in captured HSIs is usually complex and difficult to model accurately, which significantly limits the effectiveness of these approaches. In this paper, we propose a multi-stage noise-decoupling framework that decomposes complex noise into explicitly modeled and implicitly modeled components. This decoupling reduces the complexity of noise and enhances the learnability of HSI denoising methods when applied to real paired data. Specifically, for explicitly modeled noise, we utilize an existing noise model to generate paired data for pre-training a denoising network, equipping it with prior knowledge to handle the explicitly modeled noise effectively. For implicitly modeled noise, we introduce a high-frequency wavelet guided network. Leveraging the prior knowledge from the pre-trained module, this network adaptively extracts high-frequency features to target and remove the implicitly modeled noise from real paired HSIs. Furthermore, to effectively eliminate all noise components and mitigate error accumulation across stages, a multi-stage learning strategy, comprising separate pre-training and joint fine-tuning, is employed to optimize the entire framework. Extensive experiments on public and our captured datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods, effectively handling complex real-world noise and significantly enhancing HSI quality.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models show potential for general robotic tasks, but remain challenging in spatiotemporally coherent manipulation, which requires fine-grained representations. Typically, existing methods embed 3D positions into visual representations to enhance the spatial precision of actions. However, these methods struggle to achieve temporally coherent control over action execution. In this work, we propose VLA-4D, a general VLA model with 4D awareness for spatiotemporally coherent robotic manipulation. Our model is guided by two key designs: 1) 4D-aware visual representation. We extract visual features, embed 1D time into 3D positions for 4D embeddings, and fuse them into a unified visual representation via a cross-attention mechanism. 2) Spatiotemporal action representation. We extend conventional spatial action representations with temporal information to enable the spatiotemporal planning, and align the multimodal representations into the LLM for spatiotemporal action prediction. Within this unified framework, the designed visual and action representations jointly make robotic manipulation spatially-smooth and temporally-coherent. In addition, we extend the VLA dataset with temporal action annotations for fine-tuning our model. Extensive experiments have been conducted to verify the superiority of our method across different tasks of robotic manipulation.

Abstract: In medical image segmentation, heterogeneous privacy policies across institutions often make joint training on pooled datasets infeasible, motivating continual image segmentation-learning from data streams without catastrophic forgetting. While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) offers strong zero-shot priors and has been widely fine-tuned across downstream tasks, its large parameter count and computational overhead challenge practical deployment. This paper demonstrates that the SAM paradigm is highly promising once its computational efficiency and performance can be balanced. To this end, we introduce the Alignment Layer, a lightweight, plug-and-play module which aligns encoder-decoder feature distributions to efficiently adapt SAM to specific medical images, improving accuracy while reducing computation. Building on SAM and the Alignment Layer, we then propose Continual Alignment for SAM (CA-SAM), a continual learning strategy that automatically adapts the appropriate Alignment Layer to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, while leveraging SAM's zero-shot priors to preserve strong performance on unseen medical datasets. Experimented across nine medical segmentation datasets under continual-learning scenario, CA-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 解决体积CT面临的独特挑战：极端token缩放、几何各向异性、弱或噪声临床监督，使标准Transformer和对比学习方法难以直接应用。

Method: 联合优化局部Transformer进行高分辨率体积特征提取和全局Transformer进行全扫描上下文建模，结合DINO自蒸馏和SigLIP视觉语言对齐进行预训练。

Conclusion: SPECTRE证明了无需依赖私有数据即可实现高性能、可泛化的CT表示，是3D医学成像的可扩展、开放、全Transformer基础模型。

Abstract: We introduce SPECTRE, a fully transformer-based foundation model for volumetric computed tomography (CT). Our Self-Supervised & Cross-Modal Pretraining for CT Representation Extraction (SPECTRE) approach utilizes scalable 3D Vision Transformer architectures and modern self-supervised and vision-language pretraining strategies to learn general-purpose CT representations. Volumetric CT poses unique challenges, such as extreme token scaling, geometric anisotropy, and weak or noisy clinical supervision, that make standard transformer and contrastive learning recipes ineffective out of the box. The framework jointly optimizes a local transformer for high-resolution volumetric feature extraction and a global transformer for whole-scan context modeling, making large-scale 3D attention computationally tractable. Notably, SPECTRE is trained exclusively on openly available CT datasets, demonstrating that high-performing, generalizable representations can be achieved without relying on private data. Pretraining combines DINO-style self-distillation with SigLIP-based vision-language alignment using paired radiology reports, yielding features that are both geometrically consistent and clinically meaningful. Across multiple CT benchmarks, SPECTRE consistently outperforms prior CT foundation models in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, establishing SPECTRE as a scalable, open, and fully transformer-based foundation model for 3D medical imaging.

Abstract: Accurate BEV semantic segmentation from fisheye imagery remains challenging due to extreme non-linear distortion, occlusion, and depth ambiguity inherent to wide-angle projections. We present a distortion-aware BEV segmentation framework that directly processes multi-camera high-resolution fisheye images,utilizing calibrated geometric unprojection and per-pixel depth distribution estimation. Each image pixel is lifted into 3D space via Gaussian parameterization, predicting spatial means and anisotropic covariances to explicitly model geometric uncertainty. The projected 3D Gaussians are fused into a BEV representation via differentiable splatting, producing continuous, uncertainty-aware semantic maps without requiring undistortion or perspective rectification. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong segmentation performance on complex parking and urban driving scenarios, achieving IoU scores of 87.75% for drivable regions and 57.26% for vehicles under severe fisheye distortion and diverse environmental conditions.

Abstract: Realistic image super-resolution (SR) focuses on transforming real-world low-resolution (LR) images into high-resolution (HR) ones, handling more complex degradation patterns than synthetic SR tasks. This is critical for applications like surveillance, medical imaging, and consumer electronics. However, current methods struggle with limited real-world LR-HR data, impacting the learning of basic image features. Pre-trained SR models from large-scale synthetic datasets offer valuable prior knowledge, which can improve generalization, speed up training, and reduce the need for extensive real-world data in realistic SR tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, Dual-domain Adaptation Networks, which is able to efficiently adapt pre-trained image SR models from simulated to real-world datasets. To achieve this target, we first set up a spatial-domain adaptation strategy through selectively updating parameters of pre-trained models and employing the low-rank adaptation technique to adjust frozen parameters. Recognizing that image super-resolution involves recovering high-frequency components, we further integrate a frequency domain adaptation branch into the adapted model, which combines the spectral data of the input and the spatial-domain backbone's intermediate features to infer HR frequency maps, enhancing the SR result. Experimental evaluations on public realistic image SR benchmarks, including RealSR, D2CRealSR, and DRealSR, demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over existing state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: 该框架为等变模型优化提供了可复现的解决方案，弥合了群论网络设计与实际部署需求之间的差距。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework combining group equivariant convolutional neural networks (G-CNNs) with equivariant-aware structured pruning to produce compact, transformation-invariant models for resource-constrained environments. Equivariance to rotations is achieved through the C4 cyclic group via the e2cnn library,enabling consistent performance under geometric transformations while reducing computational overhead.
  Our approach introduces structured pruning that preserves equivariant properties by analyzing e2cnn layer structure and applying neuron-level pruning to fully connected components. To mitigate accuracy degradation, we implement adaptive fine-tuning that automatically triggers when accuracy drop exceeds 2%, using early stopping and learning rate scheduling for efficient recovery. The framework includes dynamic INT8 quantization and a comprehensive pipeline encompassing training, knowledge distillation, structured pruning, fine-tuning, and quantization.
  We evaluate our method on satellite imagery (EuroSAT) and standard benchmarks (CIFAR-10, Rotated MNIST) demonstrating effectiveness across diverse domains. Experimental results show 29.3% parameter reduction with significant accuracy recovery, demonstrating that structured pruning of equivariant networks achieves substantial compression while maintaining geometric robustness. Our pipeline provides a reproducible framework for optimizing equivariant models, bridging the gap between group-theoretic network design and practical deployment constraints, with particular relevance to satellite imagery analysis and geometric vision tasks.

Motivation: 现有彩色图像盲反卷积方法通常将彩色图像转为灰度图或分别处理各颜色通道，忽略了颜色通道间的相互关系。

Method: 设计了一个新颖的四元数保真项，利用四元数卷积核的特性（包含四个核：一个捕获整体模糊的非负卷积核，三个无约束的对应RGB通道的卷积核），并在盲反卷积过程中使用归一化四元数核来保持图像强度。

Result: 在真实模糊彩色图像数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法能有效去除伪影并显著改善去模糊效果。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了作为彩色图像反卷积强大工具的潜力，通过建模颜色通道间的相互依赖关系实现了更好的去模糊性能。

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenging problem of blind deconvolution for color images. Existing methods often convert color images to grayscale or process each color channel separately, which overlooking the relationships between color channels. To handle this issue, we formulate a novel quaternion fidelity term designed specifically for color image blind deconvolution. This fidelity term leverages the properties of quaternion convolution kernel, which consists of four kernels: one that functions similarly to a non-negative convolution kernel to capture the overall blur, and three additional convolution kernels without constraints corresponding to red, green and blue channels respectively model their unknown interdependencies. In order to preserve image intensity, we propose to use the normalized quaternion kernel in the blind deconvolution process. Extensive experiments on real datasets of blurred color images show that the proposed method effectively removes artifacts and significantly improves deblurring effect, demonstrating its potential as a powerful tool for color image deconvolution.

### [87] [A Little More Like This: Text-to-Image Retrieval with Vision-Language Models Using Relevance Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17255)
*Bulat Khaertdinov,Mirela Popa,Nava Tintarev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出四种基于相关性反馈的视觉语言模型检索改进策略，包括伪相关性反馈、生成式相关性反馈、注意力反馈总结器和显式反馈，在多个数据集上显著提升检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉语言模型改进通常需要微调或扩大模型规模，本文受传统文本检索启发，提出在推理时使用相关性反馈机制来提升检索性能，这种模型无关的设计既可作为微调的替代方案，也可与微调后的模型配合使用。

Method: 提出四种反馈策略：1）伪相关性反馈（PRF）-基于排名靠前结果优化查询嵌入；2）生成式相关性反馈（GRF）-使用合成字幕进行查询优化；3）注意力反馈总结器（AFS）-基于Transformer的定制模型，整合相关项目的多模态细粒度特征；4）显式反馈-使用真实字幕作为上限基准。

Result: 在Flickr30k和COCO数据集上的实验表明，GRF、AFS和显式反馈相比无反馈检索，在较小VLM上MRR@5提升3-5%，在较大VLM上提升1-3%。AFS与显式反馈类似，能够减轻查询漂移，在迭代多轮检索设置中比GRF更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 相关性反馈能够持续增强不同VLM的检索性能，为交互式和自适应视觉搜索开辟了新机会。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) enable intuitive visual search using natural language queries. However, improving their performance often requires fine-tuning and scaling to larger model variants. In this work, we propose a mechanism inspired by traditional text-based search to improve retrieval performance at inference time: relevance feedback. While relevance feedback can serve as an alternative to fine-tuning, its model-agnostic design also enables use with fine-tuned VLMs. Specifically, we introduce and evaluate four feedback strategies for VLM-based retrieval. First, we revise classical pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF), which refines query embeddings based on top-ranked results. To address its limitations, we propose generative relevance feedback (GRF), which uses synthetic captions for query refinement. Furthermore, we introduce an attentive feedback summarizer (AFS), a custom transformer-based model that integrates multimodal fine-grained features from relevant items. Finally, we simulate explicit feedback using ground-truth captions as an upper-bound baseline. Experiments on Flickr30k and COCO with the VLM backbones show that GRF, AFS, and explicit feedback improve retrieval performance by 3-5% in MRR@5 for smaller VLMs, and 1-3% for larger ones, compared to retrieval with no feedback. Moreover, AFS, similarly to explicit feedback, mitigates query drift and is more robust than GRF in iterative, multi-turn retrieval settings. Our findings demonstrate that relevance feedback can consistently enhance retrieval across VLMs and open up opportunities for interactive and adaptive visual search.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OCSR系统在准确识别立体化学信息方面面临挑战，因为区分立体异构体的视觉线索（如楔形键、虚线键、环构象）非常细微

Method: 三阶段训练范式：1)大规模噪声数据集预训练；2)多粒度微调，探索化学键分类和原子定位等辅助任务；3)强化学习后训练优化，引入立体化学结构数据集

Result: MolSight在多样化数据集上的实验表明，即使参数规模相对紧凑，通过GRPO算法也能进一步提升立体分子识别性能，达到最先进的(立体)化学光学结构识别性能

Conclusion: MolSight框架通过三阶段训练策略有效解决了OCSR中立体化学识别的挑战，为化学信息学、药物发现和LLM应用提供了可靠的工具

Abstract: Optical Chemical Structure Recognition (OCSR) plays a pivotal role in modern chemical informatics, enabling the automated conversion of chemical structure images from scientific literature, patents, and educational materials into machine-readable molecular representations. This capability is essential for large-scale chemical data mining, drug discovery pipelines, and Large Language Model (LLM) applications in related domains. However, existing OCSR systems face significant challenges in accurately recognizing stereochemical information due to the subtle visual cues that distinguish stereoisomers, such as wedge and dash bonds, ring conformations, and spatial arrangements. To address these challenges, we propose MolSight, a comprehensive learning framework for OCSR that employs a three-stage training paradigm. In the first stage, we conduct pre-training on large-scale but noisy datasets to endow the model with fundamental perception capabilities for chemical structure images. In the second stage, we perform multi-granularity fine-tuning using datasets with richer supervisory signals, systematically exploring how auxiliary tasks-specifically chemical bond classification and atom localization-contribute to molecular formula recognition. Finally, we employ reinforcement learning for post-training optimization and introduce a novel stereochemical structure dataset. Remarkably, we find that even with MolSight's relatively compact parameter size, the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm can further enhance the model's performance on stereomolecular. Through extensive experiments across diverse datasets, our results demonstrate that MolSight achieves state-of-the-art performance in (stereo)chemical optical structure recognition.

Abstract: Finger pose offers promising opportunities to expand human computer interaction capability of touchscreen devices. Existing finger pose estimation algorithms that can be implemented in portable devices predominantly rely on capacitive images, which are currently limited to estimating pitch and yaw angles and exhibit reduced accuracy when processing large-angle inputs (especially when it is greater than 45 degrees). In this paper, we propose BiFingerPose, a novel bimodal based finger pose estimation algorithm capable of simultaneously and accurately predicting comprehensive finger pose information. A bimodal input is explored, including a capacitive image and a fingerprint patch obtained from the touchscreen with an under-screen fingerprint sensor. Our approach leads to reliable estimation of roll angle, which is not achievable using only a single modality. In addition, the prediction performance of other pose parameters has also been greatly improved. The evaluation of a 12-person user study on continuous and discrete interaction tasks further validated the advantages of our approach. Specifically, BiFingerPose outperforms previous SOTA methods with over 21% improvement in prediction performance, 2.5 times higher task completion efficiency, and 23% better user operation accuracy, demonstrating its practical superiority. Finally, we delineate the application space of finger pose with respect to enhancing authentication security and improving interactive experiences, and develop corresponding prototypes to showcase the interaction potential.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在三维空间的空间推理能力有限，主要因为视觉编码器（如CLIP）仅关注实例级语义特征，导致空间信息丢失。

Method: 提出基于几何和语义特征分层融合的视觉编码器，通过层次适配器将自监督学习的几何特征补充到CLIP中，使用随机特征丢弃避免仅依赖CLIP编码器的平凡解。

Result: 在SpatialRGPT-Bench上提升空间推理任务准确率至少8.0%，推理时内存开销减少约50%。

Conclusion: SpatialGeo通过增强空间感知能力有效提升了MLLMs的空间推理性能，且具有更高的计算效率。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved significant progress in image and language tasks due to the strong reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs). Nevertheless, most MLLMs suffer from limited spatial reasoning ability to interpret and infer spatial arrangements in three-dimensional space. In this work, we propose a novel vision encoder based on hierarchical fusion of geometry and semantics features, generating spatial-aware visual embedding and boosting the spatial grounding capability of MLLMs. Specifically, we first unveil that the spatial ambiguity shortcoming stems from the lossy embedding of the vision encoder utilized in most existing MLLMs (e.g., CLIP), restricted to instance-level semantic features. This motivates us to complement CLIP with the geometry features from vision-only self-supervised learning via a hierarchical adapter, enhancing the spatial awareness in the proposed SpatialGeo. The network is efficiently trained using pretrained LLaVA model and optimized with random feature dropping to avoid trivial solutions relying solely on the CLIP encoder. Experimental results show that SpatialGeo improves the accuracy in spatial reasoning tasks, enhancing state-of-the-art models by at least 8.0% in SpatialRGPT-Bench with approximately 50% less memory cost during inference.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NoPe-NeRF++是一种无需姿态先验的NeRF训练算法，通过局部到全局的优化策略，结合特征匹配和几何一致性约束，显著提升了相机姿态估计精度和新视角合成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如NoPe-NeRF）仅关注图像局部关系，在复杂场景中难以恢复准确的相机姿态，需要更鲁棒的姿态估计方法。

Method: 采用相对姿态初始化与显式特征匹配，进行局部联合优化增强姿态估计，然后引入包含特征轨迹的全局束调整优化，结合几何一致性约束。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛评估表明，该方法在姿态估计精度和新视角合成方面优于现有最优方法，在挑战性场景中表现出卓越的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: NoPe-NeRF++是首个将局部和全局线索与NeRF无缝结合的工作，验证了设计选择的合理性，为无姿态先验的NeRF训练提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce NoPe-NeRF++, a novel local-to-global optimization algorithm for training Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) without requiring pose priors. Existing methods, particularly NoPe-NeRF, which focus solely on the local relationships within images, often struggle to recover accurate camera poses in complex scenarios. To overcome the challenges, our approach begins with a relative pose initialization with explicit feature matching, followed by a local joint optimization to enhance the pose estimation for training a more robust NeRF representation. This method significantly improves the quality of initial poses. Additionally, we introduce global optimization phase that incorporates geometric consistency constraints through bundle adjustment, which integrates feature trajectories to further refine poses and collectively boost the quality of NeRF. Notably, our method is the first work that seamlessly combines the local and global cues with NeRF, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both pose estimation accuracy and novel view synthesis. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate our superior performance and robustness, even in challenging scenes, thus validating our design choices.

Conclusion: 通过同步像素和运用光学定律，可以显著改进生成图像中透明物体的折射效果，生成更符合物理现实的图像。

Abstract: Generative image models can produce convincingly real images, with plausible shapes, textures, layouts and lighting. However, one domain in which they perform notably poorly is in the synthesis of transparent objects, which exhibit refraction, reflection, absorption and scattering. Refraction is a particular challenge, because refracted pixel rays often intersect with surfaces observed in other parts of the image, providing a constraint on the color. It is clear from inspection that generative models have not distilled the laws of optics sufficiently well to accurately render refractive objects. In this work, we consider the problem of generating images with accurate refraction, given a text prompt. We synchronize the pixels within the object's boundary with those outside by warping and merging the pixels using Snell's Law of Refraction, at each step of the generation trajectory. For those surfaces that are not directly observed in the image, but are visible via refraction or reflection, we recover their appearance by synchronizing the image with a second generated image -- a panorama centered at the object -- using the same warping and merging procedure. We demonstrate that our approach generates much more optically-plausible images that respect the physical constraints.

Abstract: Step-by-step painting tutorials are vital for learning artistic techniques, but existing video resources (e.g., YouTube) lack interactivity and personalization. While recent generative models have advanced artistic image synthesis, they struggle to generalize across media and often show temporal or structural inconsistencies, hindering faithful reproduction of human creative workflows. To address this, we propose a unified framework for multi-media painting process generation with a semantics-driven style control mechanism that embeds multiple media into a diffusion models conditional space and uses cross-medium style augmentation. This enables consistent texture evolution and process transfer across styles. A reverse-painting training strategy further ensures smooth, human-aligned generation. We also build a large-scale dataset of real painting processes and evaluate cross-media consistency, temporal coherence, and final-image fidelity, achieving strong results on LPIPS, DINO, and CLIP metrics. Finally, our Perceptual Distance Profile (PDP) curve quantitatively models the creative sequence, i.e., composition, color blocking, and detail refinement, mirroring human artistic progression.

Abstract: Skeleton-based action recognition is a hotspot in image processing. A key challenge of this task lies in its dependence on large, manually labeled datasets whose acquisition is costly and time-consuming. This paper devises a novel, label-efficient method for skeleton-based action recognition using graph convolutional networks (GCNs). The contribution of the proposed method resides in learning a novel acquisition function -- scoring the most informative subsets for labeling -- as the optimum of an objective function mixing data representativity, diversity and uncertainty. We also extend this approach by learning the most informative subsets using an invertible GCN which allows mapping data from ambient to latent spaces where the inherent distribution of the data is more easily captured. Extensive experiments, conducted on two challenging skeleton-based recognition datasets, show the effectiveness and the outperformance of our label-frugal GCNs against the related work.

Abstract: Image-based Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (I-JEPA) learns visual representations by predicting latent embeddings of masked regions from visible context. However, it treats all regions uniformly and independently, lacking an explicit notion of where or in what order predictions should be made. Inspired by human visual perception, which deploys attention selectively and sequentially from the most informative to secondary regions, we propose DSeq-JEPA, a Discriminative Sequential Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture that bridges predictive and autoregressive self-supervised learning, integrating JEPA-style latent prediction with GPT-style sequential reasoning. Specifically, DSeq-JEPA (i) first identifies primary discriminative regions based on a transformer-derived saliency map, emphasizing the distribution of visual importance, and then (ii) predicts subsequent regions in this discriminative order, progressively forming a curriculum-like semantic progression from primary to secondary cues -- a form of GPT-style pre-training. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks, including image classification (ImageNet), fine-grained visual categorization (iNaturalist21, CUB-200-2011, Stanford-Cars), detection and segmentation (MS-COCO, ADE20K), and low-level reasoning tasks (Clevr/Count, Clevr/Dist), demonstrate that DSeq-JEPA consistently focuses on more discriminative and generalizable representations than I-JEPA variants.

Conclusion: UAM作为一种统一且可扩展的多模态基础模型，在放射组学驱动的癌症诊断中展现出有效性和前景。

Abstract: Cell-level radiomics features provide fine-grained insights into tumor phenotypes and have the potential to significantly enhance diagnostic accuracy on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) images. By capturing micro-level morphological and intensity patterns, these features support more precise tumor identification and improve AI interpretability by highlighting diagnostically relevant cells for pathologist review. However, most existing studies focus on slide-level or patch-level tumor classification, leaving cell-level radiomics analysis largely unexplored. Moreover, there is currently no dedicated backbone specifically designed for radiomics data. Inspired by the recent success of the Mamba architecture in vision and language domains, we introduce a Unified Attention-Mamba (UAM) backbone for cell-level classification using radiomics features. Unlike previous hybrid approaches that integrate Attention and Mamba modules in fixed proportions, our unified design flexibly combines their capabilities within a single cohesive architecture, eliminating the need for manual ratio tuning and improving encode capability. We develop two UAM variants to comprehensively evaluate the benefits of this unified structure. Building on this backbone, we further propose a multimodal UAM framework that jointly performs cell-level classification and image segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that UAM achieves state-of-the-art performance across both tasks on public benchmarks, surpassing leading image-based foundation models. It improves cell classification accuracy from 74% to 78% ($n$=349,882 cells), and tumor segmentation precision from 75% to 80% ($n$=406 patches). These findings highlight the effectiveness and promise of UAM as a unified and extensible multimodal foundation for radiomics-driven cancer diagnosis.

Abstract: Semantic occupancy estimation enables comprehensive scene understanding for automated driving, providing dense spatial and semantic information essential for perception and planning. While Gaussian representations have been widely adopted in self-supervised occupancy estimation, the deployment of a large number of Gaussian primitives drastically increases memory requirements and is not suitable for real-time inference. In contrast, superquadrics permit reduced primitive count and lower memory requirements due to their diverse shape set. However, implementation into a self-supervised occupancy model is nontrivial due to the absence of a superquadric rasterizer to enable model supervision. Our proposed method, SuperQuadricOcc, employs a superquadric-based scene representation. By leveraging a multi-layer icosphere-tessellated Gaussian approximation of superquadrics, we enable Gaussian rasterization for supervision during training. On the Occ3D dataset, SuperQuadricOcc achieves a 75\% reduction in memory footprint, 124\% faster inference, and a 5.9\% improvement in mIoU compared to previous Gaussian-based methods, without the use of temporal labels. To our knowledge, this is the first occupancy model to enable real-time inference while maintaining competitive performance. The use of superquadrics reduces the number of primitives required for scene modeling by 84\% relative to Gaussian-based approaches. Finally, evaluation against prior methods is facilitated by our fast superquadric voxelization module. The code will be released as open source.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了ATAC方法，通过在CLIP嵌入空间计算增强诱导漂移向量来推断语义恢复方向，显著提升对抗攻击下的鲁棒性，平均超越之前SOTA方法近50%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在零样本图像-文本匹配方面表现出色，但对图像对抗扰动高度脆弱。由于对抗微调成本过高，现有测试时防御策略的鲁棒性仍然有限。

Method: ATAC方法直接在CLIP嵌入空间操作，计算增强诱导漂移向量来推断语义恢复方向，并基于这些潜在漂移的角度一致性来校正嵌入。

Result: 在各种基准测试中，ATAC始终实现显著的高鲁棒性，平均超越之前SOTA方法近50%，同时计算开销极小。在非常规和极端设置下仍保持SOTA鲁棒性，甚至对自适应攻击也展现出非平凡鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ATAC是在CLIP嵌入空间中进行测试时对抗防御的新范式中的高效方法。

Abstract: Despite its remarkable success in zero-shot image-text matching, CLIP remains highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations on images. As adversarial fine-tuning is prohibitively costly, recent works explore various test-time defense strategies; however, these approaches still exhibit limited robustness. In this work, we revisit this problem and propose a simple yet effective strategy: Augmentation-based Test-time Adversarial Correction (ATAC). Our method operates directly in the embedding space of CLIP, calculating augmentation-induced drift vectors to infer a semantic recovery direction and correcting the embedding based on the angular consistency of these latent drifts. Across a wide range of benchmarks, ATAC consistently achieves remarkably high robustness, surpassing that of previous state-of-the-art methods by nearly 50\% on average, all while requiring minimal computational overhead. Furthermore, ATAC retains state-of-the-art robustness in unconventional and extreme settings and even achieves nontrivial robustness against adaptive attacks. Our results demonstrate that ATAC is an efficient method in a novel paradigm for test-time adversarial defenses in the embedding space of CLIP.

TL;DR: 提出SVRecon方法，将稀疏体素光栅化与SDF结合用于高保真表面重建，通过几何初始化和空间平滑损失解决稀疏体素优化中的局部最小值问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏体素与邻居空间解耦且边界清晰，在优化过程中容易陷入局部最小值，而SDF提供的平滑连续几何场在独立参数化的稀疏体素间难以保持一致性。

Method: 使用视觉几何模型进行鲁棒几何初始化，并通过空间平滑损失强制父-子体素组和兄弟体素组之间的连贯关系。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法实现了强大的重建精度，并具有持续快速的收敛速度。

Conclusion: SVRecon方法成功解决了稀疏体素优化中的局部最小值问题，实现了高保真表面重建。

Abstract: We extend the recently proposed sparse voxel rasterization paradigm to the task of high-fidelity surface reconstruction by integrating Signed Distance Function (SDF), named SVRecon. Unlike 3D Gaussians, sparse voxels are spatially disentangled from their neighbors and have sharp boundaries, which makes them prone to local minima during optimization. Although SDF values provide a naturally smooth and continuous geometric field, preserving this smoothness across independently parameterized sparse voxels is nontrivial. To address this challenge, we promote coherent and smooth voxel-wise structure through (1) robust geometric initialization using a visual geometry model and (2) a spatial smoothness loss that enforces coherent relationships across parent-child and sibling voxel groups. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks show that our method achieves strong reconstruction accuracy while having consistently speedy convergence. The code will be made public.

TL;DR: 提出了非参数概率鲁棒性(NPPR)作为更实用的鲁棒性度量，无需预定义扰动分布，直接从数据学习优化分布，在分布不确定性下提供保守的鲁棒性评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概率鲁棒性(PR)方法假设固定已知的扰动分布，这在实践中不现实。为解决这一限制，需要更实用的鲁棒性度量方法。

Method: 基于高斯混合模型(GMM)与多层感知机(MLP)头及双三次上采样的NPPR估计器，覆盖输入相关和输入无关的扰动场景。

Result: 在CIFAR-10/100和Tiny ImageNet数据集上的实验验证，与现有方法相比，NPPR提供更保守（低40%）的PR估计。

Conclusion: NPPR是一个更实用的鲁棒性度量，能更好地处理分布不确定性，为深度学习模型提供更可靠的鲁棒性评估。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) models, despite their remarkable success, remain vulnerable to small input perturbations that can cause erroneous outputs, motivating the recent proposal of probabilistic robustness (PR) as a complementary alternative to adversarial robustness (AR). However, existing PR formulations assume a fixed and known perturbation distribution, an unrealistic expectation in practice. To address this limitation, we propose non-parametric probabilistic robustness (NPPR), a more practical PR metric that does not rely on any predefined perturbation distribution. Following the non-parametric paradigm in statistical modeling, NPPR learns an optimized perturbation distribution directly from data, enabling conservative PR evaluation under distributional uncertainty. We further develop an NPPR estimator based on a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) heads and bicubic up-sampling, covering various input-dependent and input-independent perturbation scenarios. Theoretical analyses establish the relationships among AR, PR, and NPPR. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet across ResNet18/50, WideResNet50 and VGG16 validate NPPR as a more practical robustness metric, showing up to 40\% more conservative (lower) PR estimates compared to assuming those common perturbation distributions used in state-of-the-arts.

Motivation: 解决可变形图像配准中高维变形空间的挑战和体素级监督稀缺的问题，现有强化学习方法在低维表示中限制了捕捉空间变化变形的能力。

Method: 提出随机高斯策略头来建模潜在特征分布，结合无监督预热和弱监督微调，通过多轨迹采样稳定训练并提高标签效率。

Result: 在三个3D配准基准测试中，相比竞争基线方法实现了持续的Dice改进，同时保持高标签效率和低参数成本。

Conclusion: MorphSeek推进了表示级策略学习范式，为高维设置中的可扩展视觉对齐提供了原则性、主干无关和优化器无关的解决方案。

Abstract: Deformable image registration (DIR) remains a fundamental yet challenging problem in medical image analysis, largely due to the prohibitively high-dimensional deformation space of dense displacement fields and the scarcity of voxel-level supervision. Existing reinforcement learning frameworks often project this space into coarse, low-dimensional representations, limiting their ability to capture spatially variant deformations. We propose MorphSeek, a fine-grained representation-level policy optimization paradigm that reformulates DIR as a spatially continuous optimization process in the latent feature space. MorphSeek introduces a stochastic Gaussian policy head atop the encoder to model a distribution over latent features, facilitating efficient exploration and coarse-to-fine refinement. The framework integrates unsupervised warm-up with weakly supervised fine-tuning through Group Relative Policy Optimization, where multi-trajectory sampling stabilizes training and improves label efficiency. Across three 3D registration benchmarks (OASIS brain MRI, LiTS liver CT, and Abdomen MR-CT), MorphSeek achieves consistent Dice improvements over competitive baselines while maintaining high label efficiency with minimal parameter cost and low step-level latency overhead. Beyond optimizer specifics, MorphSeek advances a representation-level policy learning paradigm that achieves spatially coherent and data-efficient deformation optimization, offering a principled, backbone-agnostic, and optimizer-agnostic solution for scalable visual alignment in high-dimensional settings.

Conclusion: MCMoE框架有效解决了多模态动作质量评估中的模态缺失问题，实现了鲁棒的性能表现

Abstract: Multimodal Action Quality Assessment (AQA) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm. By leveraging complementary information across shared contextual cues, it enhances the discriminative evaluation of subtle intra-class variations in highly similar action sequences. However, partial modalities are frequently unavailable at the inference stage in reality. The absence of any modality often renders existing multimodal models inoperable. Furthermore, it triggers catastrophic performance degradation due to interruptions in cross-modal interactions. To address this issue, we propose a novel Missing Completion Framework with Mixture of Experts (MCMoE) that unifies unimodal and joint representation learning in single-stage training. Specifically, we propose an adaptive gated modality generator that dynamically fuses available information to reconstruct missing modalities. We then design modality experts to learn unimodal knowledge and dynamically mix the knowledge of all experts to extract cross-modal joint representations. With a mixture of experts, missing modalities are further refined and complemented. Finally, in the training phase, we mine the complete multimodal features and unimodal expert knowledge to guide modality generation and generation-based joint representation extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MCMoE achieves state-of-the-art results in both complete and incomplete multimodal learning on three public AQA benchmarks.

Conclusion: MMT-ARD框架在增强多模态大模型对抗鲁棒性方面具有显著效果和可扩展性，为安全关键应用中的视觉语言模型部署提供了有效的鲁棒性解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in safety-critical applications, making their adversarial robustness a crucial concern. While adversarial knowledge distillation has shown promise in transferring robustness from teacher to student models, traditional single-teacher approaches suffer from limited knowledge diversity, slow convergence, and difficulty in balancing robustness and accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose MMT-ARD: a Multimodal Multi-Teacher Adversarial Robust Distillation framework. Our key innovation is a dual-teacher knowledge fusion architecture that collaboratively optimizes clean feature preservation and robust feature enhancement. To better handle challenging adversarial examples, we introduce a dynamic weight allocation strategy based on teacher confidence, enabling adaptive focus on harder samples. Moreover, to mitigate bias among teachers, we design an adaptive sigmoid-based weighting function that balances the strength of knowledge transfer across modalities. Extensive experiments on ImageNet and zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that MMT-ARD improves robust accuracy by +4.32% and zero-shot accuracy by +3.5% on the ViT-B-32 model, while achieving a 2.3x increase in training efficiency over traditional single-teacher methods. These results highlight the effectiveness and scalability of MMT-ARD in enhancing the adversarial robustness of multimodal large models.

Conclusion: 通过将深度从物理量重新定义为创作抽象，Illustrator's Depth预测为可编辑图像分解提供了新基础

Abstract: We introduce Illustrator's Depth, a novel definition of depth that addresses a key challenge in digital content creation: decomposing flat images into editable, ordered layers. Inspired by an artist's compositional process, illustrator's depth infers a layer index to each pixel, forming an interpretable image decomposition through a discrete, globally consistent ordering of elements optimized for editability. We also propose and train a neural network using a curated dataset of layered vector graphics to predict layering directly from raster inputs. Our layer index inference unlocks a range of powerful downstream applications. In particular, it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for image vectorization while also enabling high-fidelity text-to-vector-graphics generation, automatic 3D relief generation from 2D images, and intuitive depth-aware editing. By reframing depth from a physical quantity to a creative abstraction, illustrator's depth prediction offers a new foundation for editable image decomposition.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation networks trained under full supervision for one type of lidar fail to generalize to unseen lidars without intervention. To reduce the performance gap under domain shifts, a recent trend is to leverage vision foundation models (VFMs) providing robust features across domains. In this work, we conduct an exhaustive study to identify recipes for exploiting VFMs in unsupervised domain adaptation for semantic segmentation of lidar point clouds. Building upon unsupervised image-to-lidar knowledge distillation, our study reveals that: (1) the architecture of the lidar backbone is key to maximize the generalization performance on a target domain; (2) it is possible to pretrain a single backbone once and for all, and use it to address many domain shifts; (3) best results are obtained by keeping the pretrained backbone frozen and training an MLP head for semantic segmentation. The resulting pipeline achieves state-of-the-art results in four widely-recognized and challenging settings. The code will be available at: https://github.com/valeoai/muddos.

Abstract: When performing robot/vehicle localization using ground penetrating radar (GPR) to handle adverse weather and environmental conditions, existing techniques often struggle to accurately estimate distances when processing B-scan images with minor distinctions. This study introduces a new neural network-based odometry method that leverages the similarity and difference features of GPR B-scan images for precise estimation of the Euclidean distances traveled between the B-scan images. The new custom neural network extracts multi-scale features from B-scan images taken at consecutive moments and then determines the Euclidean distance traveled by analyzing the similarities and differences between these features. To evaluate our method, an ablation study and comparison experiments have been conducted using the publicly available CMU-GPR dataset. The experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art counterparts in all tests. Specifically, our method achieves a root mean square error (RMSE), and achieves an overall weighted RMSE of 0.449 m across all data sets, which is a 10.2\% reduction in RMSE when compared to the best state-of-the-art method.

Abstract: World models learn to predict the temporal evolution of visual observations given a control signal, potentially enabling agents to reason about environments through forward simulation. Because of the focus on forward simulation, current world models generate predictions based on factual observations. For many emerging applications, such as comprehensive evaluations of physical AI behavior under varying conditions, the ability of world models to answer counterfactual queries, such as "what would happen if this object was removed?", is of increasing importance. We formalize counterfactual world models that additionally take interventions as explicit inputs, predicting temporal sequences under hypothetical modifications to observed scene properties. Traditional world models operate directly on entangled pixel-space representations where object properties and relationships cannot be selectively modified. This modeling choice prevents targeted interventions on specific scene properties. We introduce CWMDT, a framework to overcome those limitations, turning standard video diffusion models into effective counterfactual world models. First, CWMDT constructs digital twins of observed scenes to explicitly encode objects and their relationships, represented as structured text. Second, CWMDT applies large language models to reason over these representations and predict how a counterfactual intervention propagates through time to alter the observed scene. Third, CWMDT conditions a video diffusion model with the modified representation to generate counterfactual visual sequences. Evaluations on two benchmarks show that the CWMDT approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, suggesting that alternative representations of videos, such as the digital twins considered here, offer powerful control signals for video forward simulation-based world models.

Abstract: Determining the shape of 3D objects from high-frequency radar signals is analytically complex but critical for commercial and aerospace applications. Previous deep learning methods have been applied to radar modeling; however, they often fail to represent arbitrary shapes or have difficulty with real-world radar signals which are collected over limited viewing angles. Existing methods in optical 3D reconstruction can generate arbitrary shapes from limited camera views, but struggle when they naively treat the radar signal as a camera view. In this work, we present Radar2Shape, a denoising diffusion model that handles a partially observable radar signal for 3D reconstruction by correlating its frequencies with multiresolution shape features. Our method consists of a two-stage approach: first, Radar2Shape learns a regularized latent space with hierarchical resolutions of shape features, and second, it diffuses into this latent space by conditioning on the frequencies of the radar signal in an analogous coarse-to-fine manner. We demonstrate that Radar2Shape can successfully reconstruct arbitrary 3D shapes even from partially-observed radar signals, and we show robust generalization to two different simulation methods and real-world data. Additionally, we release two synthetic benchmark datasets to encourage future research in the high-frequency radar domain so that models like Radar2Shape can safely be adapted into real-world radar systems.

Abstract: The human spine is a complex structure composed of 33 vertebrae. It holds the body and is important for leading a healthy life. The spine is vulnerable to age-related degenerations that can be identified through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this paper we propose a novel computer-vison-based deep learning method to estimate spine age using images from over 18,000 MRI series. Data are restricted to subjects with only age-related spine degeneration. Eligibility criteria are created by identifying common age-based clusters of degenerative spine conditions using uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) and hierarchical density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (HDBSCAN). Model selection is determined using a detailed ablation study on data size, loss, and the effect of different spine regions. We evaluate the clinical utility of our model by calculating the difference between actual spine age and model-predicted age, the spine age gap (SAG), and examining the association between these differences and spine degenerative conditions and lifestyle factors. We find that SAG is associated with conditions including disc bulges, disc osteophytes, spinal stenosis, and fractures, as well as lifestyle factors like smoking and physically demanding work, and thus may be a useful biomarker for measuring overall spine health.

Abstract: Scaling up multimodal models has enabled remarkable advances in visual understanding and reasoning, but practical demands call for smaller, efficient systems. In this work, we conduct a principled analysis of downscaling intelligence in multimodal models, examining how reduced large language model (LLM) capacity affects multimodal capabilities. Our initial findings reveal an interesting trend: LLM downscaling disproportionately affects visual capabilities, rather than abilities inherited from the LLM. We then examine whether this drop mainly reflects the expected decline in visual reasoning or a more fundamental loss of perceptual abilities. Isolating the effect of LLM downscaling on perception, we find performance still drops sharply, often matching or exceeding the impact on reasoning. To address this bottleneck, we introduce visual extraction tuning, which explicitly trains the model to extract instruction-relevant visual details consistently across tasks. With these extracted visual details, we then apply step-by-step reasoning to generate answers. Together, these components form our Extract+Think approach, setting a new standard for efficiency and performance in this space.

Result: Video-R4-7B在M4-ViteVQA上达到最先进结果，并能泛化到多页文档QA、幻灯片QA和通用视频QA任务。

Conclusion: 迭代反刍是像素基础多模态推理的有效范式，能够显著提升文本丰富视频的理解能力。

Abstract: Understanding text-rich videos requires reading small, transient textual cues that often demand repeated inspection. Yet most video QA models rely on single-pass perception over fixed frames, leading to hallucinations and failures on fine-grained evidence. Inspired by how humans pause, zoom, and re-read critical regions, we introduce Video-R4 (Reinforcing Text-Rich Video Reasoning with Visual Rumination), a video reasoning LMM that performs visual rumination: iteratively selecting frames, zooming into informative regions, re-encoding retrieved pixels, and updating its reasoning state. We construct two datasets with executable rumination trajectories: Video-R4-CoT-17k for supervised practice and Video-R4-RL-30k for reinforcement learning. We propose a multi-stage rumination learning framework that progressively finetunes a 7B LMM to learn atomic and mixing visual operations via SFT and GRPO-based RL. Video-R4-7B achieves state-of-the-art results on M4-ViteVQA and further generalizes to multi-page document QA, slides QA, and generic video QA, demonstrating that iterative rumination is an effective paradigm for pixel-grounded multimodal reasoning.

Motivation: 传统方法直接将事件映射到强度图像存在感知质量差、模型容量和训练数据难以扩展的问题，需要一种能生成高质量视频且不依赖配对数据集的方法。

Method: 提出事件扩散模型EvDiff，采用单步前向扩散降低计算成本，设计时序一致的EvEncoder，并引入代理训练框架利用大规模图像数据集。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法在保真度和真实感之间达到最佳平衡，在像素级和感知指标上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EvDiff能够仅从单色事件流生成高质量彩色视频，解决了传统方法的局限性，为事件相机图像重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: As neuromorphic sensors, event cameras asynchronously record changes in brightness as streams of sparse events with the advantages of high temporal resolution and high dynamic range. Reconstructing intensity images from events is a highly ill-posed task due to the inherent ambiguity of absolute brightness. Early methods generally follow an end-to-end regression paradigm, directly mapping events to intensity frames in a deterministic manner. While effective to some extent, these approaches often yield perceptually inferior results and struggle to scale up in model capacity and training data. In this work, we propose EvDiff, an event-based diffusion model that follows a surrogate training framework to produce high-quality videos. To reduce the heavy computational cost of high-frame-rate video generation, we design an event-based diffusion model that performs only a single forward diffusion step, equipped with a temporally consistent EvEncoder. Furthermore, our novel Surrogate Training Framework eliminates the dependence on paired event-image datasets, allowing the model to leverage large-scale image datasets for higher capacity. The proposed EvDiff is capable of generating high-quality colorful videos solely from monochromatic event streams. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method strikes a sweet spot between fidelity and realism, outperforming existing approaches on both pixel-level and perceptual metrics.

Conclusion: 所提出的规划框架和自发式方法能够在大型机器人环境中高效处理时序逻辑任务规划问题，特别是在任务无法完全满足时，通过整合用户偏好实现最佳可能的任务满足度。

Abstract: In this work, we consider the problem of planning for temporal logic tasks in large robot environments. When full task compliance is unattainable, we aim to achieve the best possible task satisfaction by integrating user preferences for relaxation into the planning process. Utilizing the automata-based representations for temporal logic goals and user preferences, we propose an A*-based planning framework. This approach effectively tackles large-scale problems while generating near-optimal high-level trajectories. To facilitate this, we propose a simple, efficient heuristic that allows for planning over large robot environments in a fraction of time and search memory as compared to uninformed search algorithms. We present extensive case studies to demonstrate the scalability, runtime analysis as well as empirical bounds on the suboptimality of the proposed heuristic.

Conclusion: 这项工作为机器人和人机界面的大规模触觉智能提供了一条高效途径。

Abstract: Development of large-area, high-speed electronic skins is a grand challenge for robotics, prosthetics, and human-machine interfaces, but is fundamentally limited by wiring complexity and data bottlenecks. Here, we introduce Single-Pixel Tactile Skin (SPTS), a paradigm that uses compressive sampling to reconstruct rich tactile information from an entire sensor array via a single output channel. This is achieved through a direct circuit-level implementation where each sensing element, equipped with a miniature microcontroller, contributes a dynamically weighted analog signal to a global sum, performing distributed compressed sensing in hardware. Our flexible, daisy-chainable design simplifies wiring to a few input lines and one output, and significantly reduces measurement requirements compared to raster scanning methods. We demonstrate the system's performance by achieving object classification at an effective 3500 FPS and by capturing transient dynamics, resolving an 8 ms projectile impact into 23 frames. A key feature is the support for adaptive reconstruction, where sensing fidelity scales with measurement time. This allows for rapid contact localization using as little as 7% of total data, followed by progressive refinement to a high-fidelity image - a capability critical for responsive robotic systems. This work offers an efficient pathway towards large-scale tactile intelligence for robotics and human-machine interfaces.

Motivation: 传统人工势场法在多无人机场景中导致飞行路径冗余、航向频繁突变，且在避障过程中容易发生无人机间碰撞，需要改进路径规划策略。

Conclusion: 该混合算法在未知障碍物的静态环境中具有适用性和有效性，验证了其优越性能。

Abstract: In multi UAV scenarios,the traditional Artificial Potential Field (APF) method often leads to redundant flight paths and frequent abrupt heading changes due to unreasonable obstacle avoidance path planning,and is highly prone to inter UAV collisions during the obstacle avoidance process.To address these issues,this study proposes a novel hybrid algorithm that combines the improved Multi-Robot Formation Obstacle Avoidance (MRF IAPF) algorithm with an enhanced APF optimized for single UAV path planning.Its core ideas are as follows:first,integrating three types of interaction forces from MRF IAPF obstacle repulsion force,inter UAV interaction force,and target attraction force;second,incorporating a refined single UAV path optimization mechanism,including collision risk assessment and an auxiliary sub goal strategy.When a UAV faces a high collision threat,temporary waypoints are generated to guide obstacle avoidance,ensuring eventual precise arrival at the actual target.Simulation results demonstrate that compared with traditional APF based formation algorithms,the proposed algorithm achieves significant improvements in path length optimization and heading stability,can effectively avoid obstacles and quickly restore the formation configuration,thus verifying its applicability and effectiveness in static environments with unknown obstacles.

Abstract: Dense 3D semantic occupancy perception is critical for mobile robots operating in pedestrian-rich environments, yet it remains underexplored compared to its application in autonomous driving. To address this gap, we present MobileOcc, a semantic occupancy dataset for mobile robots operating in crowded human environments. Our dataset is built using an annotation pipeline that incorporates static object occupancy annotations and a novel mesh optimization framework explicitly designed for human occupancy modeling. It reconstructs deformable human geometry from 2D images and subsequently refines and optimizes it using associated LiDAR point data. Using MobileOcc, we establish benchmarks for two tasks, i) Occupancy prediction and ii) Pedestrian velocity prediction, using different methods including monocular, stereo, and panoptic occupancy, with metrics and baseline implementations for reproducible comparison. Beyond occupancy prediction, we further assess our annotation method on 3D human pose estimation datasets. Results demonstrate that our method exhibits robust performance across different datasets.

Abstract: Imitation learning has achieved remarkable success in a variety of robotic tasks by learning a mapping function from camera-space observations to robot-space actions. Recent work indicates that the use of robot-to-camera transformation information ({\ie}, camera extrinsics) benefits the learning process and produces better results. However, camera extrinsics are oftentimes unavailable and estimation methods usually suffer from local minima and poor generalizations. In this paper, we present CalibAll, a simple yet effective method that \textbf{requires only a single mark} and performs training-free, stable, and accurate camera extrinsic estimation across diverse robots and datasets through a coarse-to-fine calibration pipeline. In particular, we annotate a single mark on an end-effector (EEF), and leverage the correspondence ability emerged from vision foundation models (VFM) to automatically localize the corresponding mark across robots in diverse datasets. Using this mark, together with point tracking and the 3D EEF trajectory, we obtain a coarse camera extrinsic via temporal Perspective-n-Point (PnP). This estimate is further refined through a rendering-based optimization that aligns rendered and ground-true masks, yielding accurate and stable camera extrinsic. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, showing strong robustness and general effectiveness across three robot platforms. It also produces useful auxiliary annotations such as depth maps, link-wise masks, and end-effector 2D trajectories, which can further support downstream tasks.

Abstract: Obstacle avoidance in complex and dynamic environments is a critical challenge for real-time robot navigation. Model-based and learning-based methods often fail in highly dynamic scenarios because traditional methods assume a static environment and cannot adapt to real-time changes, while learning-based methods rely on single-frame observations for motion constraint estimation, limiting their adaptability. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework that leverages multi-frame point constraints, including current and future frames predicted by a dedicated module, to enable proactive end-to-end navigation. By incorporating a prediction module that forecasts the future path of moving obstacles based on multi-frame observations, our method allows the robot to proactively anticipate and avoid potential dangers. This proactive planning capability significantly enhances navigation robustness and efficiency in unknown dynamic environments. Simulations and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach.

Motivation: 现有的视频和动作预测方法通常以整体和无目标的方式处理观察和动作生成，导致语义不对齐的预测和不连贯的行为。需要一种能够将预测锚定到任务目标并实现观察与动作显式交互的方法。

Method: H-GAR采用分层交互框架：1) 首先生成目标观察和粗略动作草图；2) 目标条件观察合成器基于粗略动作和目标观察合成中间观察；3) 交互感知动作精炼器利用中间观察反馈和历史动作记忆库精炼动作。

Result: 在仿真和真实世界机器人操作任务上的大量实验表明，H-GAR实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: H-GAR通过将目标锚定与显式动作-观察交互以从粗到细的方式集成，实现了更准确的机器人操作。

Abstract: Unified video and action prediction models hold great potential for robotic manipulation, as future observations offer contextual cues for planning, while actions reveal how interactions shape the environment. However, most existing approaches treat observation and action generation in a monolithic and goal-agnostic manner, often leading to semantically misaligned predictions and incoherent behaviors. To this end, we propose H-GAR, a Hierarchical interaction framework via Goal-driven observation-Action Refinement.To anchor prediction to the task objective, H-GAR first produces a goal observation and a coarse action sketch that outline a high-level route toward the goal. To enable explicit interaction between observation and action under the guidance of the goal observation for more coherent decision-making, we devise two synergistic modules. (1) Goal-Conditioned Observation Synthesizer (GOS) synthesizes intermediate observations based on the coarse-grained actions and the predicted goal observation. (2) Interaction-Aware Action Refiner (IAAR) refines coarse actions into fine-grained, goal-consistent actions by leveraging feedback from the intermediate observations and a Historical Action Memory Bank that encodes prior actions to ensure temporal consistency. By integrating goal grounding with explicit action-observation interaction in a coarse-to-fine manner, H-GAR enables more accurate manipulation. Extensive experiments on both simulation and real-world robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that H-GAR achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: 语义进度推理能够更准确地表示导航进展，为视觉语言导航提供了更一致和有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation requires agents to act coherently over long horizons by understanding not only local visual context but also how far they have advanced within a multi-step instruction. However, recent Vision-Language-Action models focus on direct action prediction and earlier progress methods predict numeric achievements; both overlook the monotonic co-progression property of the observation and instruction sequences. Building on this insight, Progress-Think introduces semantic progress reasoning, predicting instruction-style progress from visual observations to enable more accurate navigation. To achieve this without expensive annotations, we propose a three-stage framework. In the initial stage, Self-Aligned Progress Pretraining bootstraps a reasoning module via a novel differentiable alignment between visual history and instruction prefixes. Then, Progress-Guided Policy Pretraining injects learned progress states into the navigation context, guiding the policy toward consistent actions. Finally, Progress-Policy Co-Finetuning jointly optimizes both modules with tailored progress-aware reinforcement objectives. Experiments on R2R-CE and RxR-CE show state-of-the-art success and efficiency, demonstrating that semantic progress yields a more consistent representation of navigation advancement.

Abstract: Reflections of active markers in the environment are a common source of ambiguity in onboard visual relative localization. This work presents a novel approach for onboard relative localization in multi-robot teams that exploits these typically unwanted reflections of active markers in the environment. It operates without prior knowledge of robot size or predefined marker configurations and remains independent of surface properties, an essential feature for heterogeneous micro-aerial swarms cooperating in unknown environments. It explicitly accounts for uncertainties caused by non-flat surfaces, with a particular focus on dynamic water surfaces, which are especially relevant for marine deployments. We validated the approach in both indoor and outdoor experiments, demonstrating that the proposed reflection-based localization system operates reliably without prior knowledge of team member size and achieves greater effective range (above 30 m) and accuracy than state-of-the-art methods. The video and source code of this work will be made publicly available after publication.

Abstract: Various methods for robot design optimization have been developed so far. These methods are diverse, ranging from numerical optimization to black-box optimization. While numerical optimization is fast, it is not suitable for cases involving complex structures or discrete values, leading to frequent use of black-box optimization instead. However, black-box optimization suffers from low sampling efficiency and takes considerable sampling iterations to obtain good solutions. In this study, we propose a method to enhance the efficiency of robot body design based on black-box optimization by utilizing large language models (LLMs). In parallel with the sampling process based on black-box optimization, sampling is performed using LLMs, which are provided with problem settings and extensive feedback. We demonstrate that this method enables more efficient exploration of design solutions and discuss its characteristics and limitations.

Abstract: In daily life, people often move through spaces to find objects that meet their needs, posing a key challenge in embodied AI. Traditional Demand-Driven Navigation (DDN) handles one need at a time but does not reflect the complexity of real-world tasks involving multiple needs and personal choices. To bridge this gap, we introduce Task-Preferenced Multi-Demand-Driven Navigation (TP-MDDN), a new benchmark for long-horizon navigation involving multiple sub-demands with explicit task preferences. To solve TP-MDDN, we propose AWMSystem, an autonomous decision-making system composed of three key modules: BreakLLM (instruction decomposition), LocateLLM (goal selection), and StatusMLLM (task monitoring). For spatial memory, we design MASMap, which combines 3D point cloud accumulation with 2D semantic mapping for accurate and efficient environmental understanding. Our Dual-Tempo action generation framework integrates zero-shot planning with policy-based fine control, and is further supported by an Adaptive Error Corrector that handles failure cases in real time. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both perception accuracy and navigation robustness.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a simulator, based on the open-source physics engine MuJoCo, for the design and control of soft robotic nets for the autonomous removal of space debris. The proposed simulator includes net dynamics, contact between the net and the debris, self-contact of the net, orbital mechanics, and a controller that can actuate thrusters on the four satellites at the corners of the net. It showcases the case of capturing Envisat, a large ESA satellite that remains in orbit as space debris following the end of its mission. This work investigates different mechanical models, which can be used to simulate the net dynamics, simulating various degrees of compliance, and different control strategies to achieve the capture of the debris, depending on the relative position of the net and the target. Unlike previous works on this topic, we do not assume that the net has been previously ballistically thrown toward the target, and we start from a relatively static configuration. The results show that a more compliant net achieves higher performance when attempting the capture of Envisat. Moreover, when paired with a sliding mode controller, soft nets are able to achieve successful capture in 100% of the tested cases, whilst also showcasing a higher effective area at contact and a higher number of contact points between net and Envisat.

Abstract: This paper presents an efficient approach for determining the joint configuration of a multifingered gripper solely from the point cloud data of its poly-articulated chain, as generated by visual sensors, simulations or even generative neural networks. Well-known inverse kinematics (IK) techniques can provide mathematically exact solutions (when they exist) for joint configuration determination based solely on the fingertip pose, but often require post-hoc decision-making by considering the positions of all intermediate phalanges in the gripper's fingers, or rely on algorithms to numerically approximate solutions for more complex kinematics. In contrast, our method leverages machine learning to implicitly overcome these challenges. This is achieved through a Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (CVAE), which takes point cloud data of key structural elements as input and reconstructs the corresponding joint configurations. We validate our approach on the MultiDex grasping dataset using the Allegro Hand, operating within 0.05 milliseconds and achieving accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods. This highlights the effectiveness of our pipeline for joint configuration estimation within the broader context of AI-driven techniques for grasp planning.

Abstract: Autonomous exploration of unknown environments is a key capability for mobile robots, but it is largely unsolved for robots equipped with only a single monocular camera and no dense range sensors. In this paper, we present a novel approach to monocular vision-based exploration that can safely cover large-scale unstructured indoor and outdoor 3D environments by explicitly accounting for the properties of a sparse monocular SLAM frontend in both mapping and planning. The mapping module solves the problems of sparse depth data, free-space gaps, and large depth uncertainty by oversampling free space in texture-sparse areas and keeping track of obstacle position uncertainty. The planning module handles the added free-space uncertainty through rapid replanning and perception-aware heading control. We further show that frontier-based exploration is possible with sparse monocular depth data when parallax requirements and the possibility of textureless surfaces are taken into account. We evaluate our approach extensively in diverse real-world and simulated environments, including ablation studies. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the proposed method is the first to achieve 3D monocular exploration in real-world unstructured outdoor environments. We open-source our implementation to support future research.

Abstract: We present FORWARD, a high-resolution multimodal dataset of a cut-to-length forwarder operating in rough terrain on two harvest sites in the middle part of Sweden. The forwarder is a large Komatsu model equipped with a variety of sensors, including RTK-GNSS, 360-camera, operator vibration sensors, internal CAN-bus signal recording, and multiple IMUs. The data includes event time logs recorded in 5 Hz with e.g., driving speed, fuel consumption, vehicle position with centimeter accuracy, and crane use while the vehicle operates in forest areas laser-scanned with very high-resolution, $\sim$1500 points per square meter. Production log files (StanForD standard) with time-stamped machine events, extensive video material, and terrain data in various formats are included as well. About 18 hours of regular wood extraction work during three days is annotated from 360-video material into individual work elements and included in the dataset. We also include scenario specifications of conducted experiments on forest roads and in terrain. Scenarios include repeatedly driving the same routes with and without steel tracks, different load weight, and different target driving speeds. The dataset is intended for developing models and algorithms for trafficability, perception, and autonomous control of forest machines using artificial intelligence, simulation, and experiments on physical testbeds. In part, we focus on forwarders traversing terrain, avoiding obstacles, and loading or unloading logs, with consideration for efficiency, fuel consumption, safety, and environmental impact. Other benefits of the open dataset include the ability to explore auto-generation and calibration of forestry machine simulators and automation scenario descriptions using the data recorded in the field.

Abstract: Human-robot collaboration towards a shared goal requires robots to understand human action and interaction with the surrounding environment. This paper focuses on human-robot interaction (HRI) based on human-robot dialogue that relies on the robot action confirmation and action step generation using multimodal scene understanding. The state-of-the-art approach uses multimodal transformers to generate robot action steps aligned with robot action confirmation from a single clip showing a task composed of multiple micro steps. Although actions towards a long-horizon task depend on each other throughout an entire video, the current approaches mainly focus on clip-level processing and do not leverage long-context information. This paper proposes a long-context Q-former incorporating left and right context dependency in full videos. Furthermore, this paper proposes a text-conditioning approach to feed text embeddings directly into the LLM decoder to mitigate the high abstraction of the information in text by Q-former. Experiments with the YouCook2 corpus show that the accuracy of confirmation generation is a major factor in the performance of action planning. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the long-context Q-former improves the confirmation and action planning by integrating VideoLLaMA3.

Conclusion: METIS是迈向灵巧操作通用模型的有前景的一步，证明了整合多源数据和统一框架的有效性。

Abstract: Building a generalist robot that can perceive, reason, and act across diverse tasks remains an open challenge, especially for dexterous manipulation. A major bottleneck lies in the scarcity of large-scale, action-annotated data for dexterous skills, as teleoperation is difficult and costly. Human data, with its vast scale and diverse manipulation behaviors, provides rich priors for learning robotic actions. While prior works have explored leveraging human demonstrations, they are often constrained by limited scenarios and a large visual gap between human and robots. To eliminate these limitations, we propose METIS, a vision-language-action (VLA) model for dexterous manipulation pretrained on multi-source egocentric datasets. We first construct EgoAtlas, which integrates large-scale human and robotic data from multiple sources, all unified under a consistent action space. We further extract motion-aware dynamics, a compact and discretized motion representation, which provides efficient and expressive supervision for VLA training. Built upon them, METIS integrates reasoning and acting into a unified framework, enabling effective deployment to downstream dexterous manipulation tasks. Our method demonstrates exceptional dexterous manipulation capabilities, achieving highest average success rate in six real-world tasks. Experimental results also highlight the superior generalization and robustness to out-of-distribution scenarios. These findings emphasize METIS as a promising step toward a generalist model for dexterous manipulation.

Abstract: Humanoid robots are envisioned to perform a wide range of tasks in human-centered environments, requiring controllers that combine agility with robust balance. Recent advances in locomotion and whole-body tracking have enabled impressive progress in either agile dynamic skills or stability-critical behaviors, but existing methods remain specialized, focusing on one capability while compromising the other. In this work, we introduce AMS (Agility Meets Stability), the first framework that unifies both dynamic motion tracking and extreme balance maintenance in a single policy. Our key insight is to leverage heterogeneous data sources: human motion capture datasets that provide rich, agile behaviors, and physically constrained synthetic balance motions that capture stability configurations. To reconcile the divergent optimization goals of agility and stability, we design a hybrid reward scheme that applies general tracking objectives across all data while injecting balance-specific priors only into synthetic motions. Further, an adaptive learning strategy with performance-driven sampling and motion-specific reward shaping enables efficient training across diverse motion distributions. We validate AMS extensively in simulation and on a real Unitree G1 humanoid. Experiments demonstrate that a single policy can execute agile skills such as dancing and running, while also performing zero-shot extreme balance motions like Ip Man's Squat, highlighting AMS as a versatile control paradigm for future humanoid applications.

Abstract: The vector cost bimatrix game is a method for multi-objective decision making that enables autonomous robotic systems to optimize for multiple goals at once while avoiding worst-case scenarios in neglected objectives. We expand this approach to arbitrary numbers of objectives and compare its performance to scalar weighted sum methods during competitive motion planning. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) software is used to aid in the analysis of high dimensional decision-making data. State-space Exploration of Multidimensional Boundaries using Adherence Strategies (SEMBAS) is applied to explore performance modes in the parameter space as a sensitivity study for the baseline and proposed frameworks. While some works have explored aspects of game theoretic planning and intelligent systems validation separately, we combine each of these into a novel and comprehensive simulation pipeline. This integration demonstrates a dramatic improvement of the vector cost method over scalarization and offers an interpretable and generalizable framework for robotic behavioral planning.

Abstract: While Visual Large Language Models (VLLMs) show great promise as embodied agents, they continue to face substantial challenges in spatial reasoning. Existing embodied benchmarks largely focus on passive, static household environments and evaluate only isolated capabilities, failing to capture holistic performance in dynamic, real-world complexity. To fill this gap, we present IndustryNav, the first dynamic industrial navigation benchmark for active spatial reasoning. IndustryNav leverages 12 manually created, high-fidelity Unity warehouse scenarios featuring dynamic objects and human movement. Our evaluation employs a PointGoal navigation pipeline that effectively combines egocentric vision with global odometry to assess holistic local-global planning. Crucially, we introduce the "collision rate" and "warning rate" metrics to measure safety-oriented behaviors and distance estimation. A comprehensive study of nine state-of-the-art VLLMs (including models such as GPT-5-mini, Claude-4.5, and Gemini-2.5) reveals that closed-source models maintain a consistent advantage; however, all agents exhibit notable deficiencies in robust path planning, collision avoidance and active exploration. This highlights a critical need for embodied research to move beyond passive perception and toward tasks that demand stable planning, active exploration, and safe behavior in dynamic, real-world environment.

Abstract: Learning human-like, robust bipedal walking remains difficult due to hybrid dynamics and terrain variability. We propose a lightweight framework that combines a gait generator network learned from human motion with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) controller for torque control.

Results suggest that pairing spectral motion priors with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a practical path toward natural and robust bipedal locomotion with modest training cost.

Abstract: Non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) offer an intuitive means for individuals with severe motor impairments to independently operate assistive robotic wheelchairs and navigate built environments. Despite considerable progress in BCI research, most current motion control systems are limited to discrete commands, rather than supporting continuous pursuit, where users can freely adjust speed and direction in real time. Such natural mobility control is, however, essential for wheelchair users to navigate complex public spaces, such as transit stations, airports, hospitals, and indoor corridors, to interact socially with the dynamic populations with agility, and to move flexibly and comfortably as autonomous driving is refined to allow movement at will. In this study, we address the gap of continuous pursuit motion control in BCIs by proposing and validating a brain-inspired Bayesian inference framework, where embodied dynamics in acceleration-based motor representations are decoded. This approach contrasts with conventional kinematics-level decoding and deep learning-based methods. Using a public dataset with sixteen hours of EEG from four subjects performing motor imagery-based target-following, we demonstrate that our method, utilizing Automatic Relevance Determination for feature selection and continual online learning, reduces the normalized mean squared error between predicted and true velocities by 72% compared to autoregressive and EEGNet-based methods in a session-accumulative transfer learning setting. Theoretically, these findings empirically support embodied cognition theory and reveal the brain's intrinsic motor control dynamics in an embodied and predictive nature. Practically, grounding EEG decoding in the same dynamical principles that govern biological motion offers a promising path toward more stable and intuitive BCI control.

Abstract: Robotic Foundation Models (RFMs) hold great promise as generalist, end-to-end systems for robot control. Yet their ability to generalize across new environments, tasks, and embodiments remains limited. We argue that a major bottleneck lies in their foundations: most RFMs are built by fine-tuning internet-pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, these VLMs are trained on 2D image-language tasks and lack the 3D spatial reasoning inherently required for embodied control in the 3D world. Bridging this gap directly with large-scale robotic data is costly and difficult to scale. Instead, we propose to enrich easy-to-collect non-robotic image data with 3D annotations and enhance a pretrained VLM with 3D understanding capabilities. Following this strategy, we train SPEAR-VLM, a 3D-aware VLM that infers object coordinates in 3D space from a single 2D image. Building on SPEAR-VLM, we introduce our main contribution, $~\textbf{SPEAR-1}$: a robotic foundation model that integrates grounded 3D perception with language-instructed embodied control. Trained on $\sim$45M frames from 24 Open X-Embodiment datasets, SPEAR-1 outperforms or matches state-of-the-art models such as $π_0$-FAST and $π_{0.5}$, while it uses 20$\times$ fewer robot demonstrations. This carefully-engineered training strategy unlocks new VLM capabilities and as a consequence boosts the reliability of embodied control beyond what is achievable with only robotic data. We make our model weights and 3D-annotated datasets publicly available.

Abstract: Modeling realistic and interactive multi-agent behavior is critical to autonomous driving and traffic simulation. However, existing diffusion and autoregressive approaches are limited by iterative sampling, sequential decoding, or task-specific designs, which hinder efficiency and reuse. We propose Masked Denoising Generation (MDG), a unified generative framework that reformulates multi-agent behavior modeling as the reconstruction of independently noised spatiotemporal tensors. Instead of relying on diffusion time steps or discrete tokenization, MDG applies continuous, per-agent and per-timestep noise masks that enable localized denoising and controllable trajectory generation in a single or few forward passes. This mask-driven formulation generalizes across open-loop prediction, closed-loop simulation, motion planning, and conditional generation within one model. Trained on large-scale real-world driving datasets, MDG achieves competitive closed-loop performance on the Waymo Sim Agents and nuPlan Planning benchmarks, while providing efficient, consistent, and controllable open-loop multi-agent trajectory generation. These results position MDG as a simple yet versatile paradigm for multi-agent behavior modeling.

Our system, named HALO, addresses two key challenges: (i) real-time dense 3D reconstruction using vision at large distances, and (ii) mapping and exploration of large-scale outdoor environments with accurate scene geometry and semantics. We demonstrate that HALO can plan informative paths that exploit this information to complete missions with multiple tasks specified in natural language. In simulation-based evaluation across large-scale environments of size up to 78,000 sq. m., HALO consistently completes tasks with less exploration time and achieves up to 68% higher competitive ratio in terms of the distance traveled compared to the state-of-the-art semantic exploration baseline. We use real-world experiments on a custom quadrotor platform to demonstrate that (i) all modules can run onboard the robot, and that (ii) in diverse environments HALO can support effective autonomous execution of missions covering up to 24,600 sq. m. area at an altitude of 40 m.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VLA模型和世界模型通常是分开训练的，缺乏相互增强。本文旨在构建一个统一框架，让VLA模型和世界模型能够相互促进，提升整体性能。

Method: 提出统一框架：世界模型利用动作和视觉输入预测未来图像状态，学习环境物理特性；VLA模型从图像观测生成后续动作，增强视觉理解并支持世界模型的图像生成。两个组件通过联合学习相互增强。

Result: 在LIBERO仿真基准测试中达到97.4%成功率（无需预训练）；在真实世界LeRobot实验中，集成世界模型使整体成功率提升50%。

Conclusion: RynnVLA-002证明了VLA模型和世界模型的统一框架能够相互增强，超越单独模型，在仿真和真实机器人任务中均表现出卓越性能。

Abstract: We introduce RynnVLA-002, a unified Vision-Language-Action (VLA) and world model. The world model leverages action and visual inputs to predict future image states, learning the underlying physics of the environment to refine action generation. Conversely, the VLA model produces subsequent actions from image observations, enhancing visual understanding and supporting the world model's image generation. The unified framework of RynnVLA-002 enables joint learning of environmental dynamics and action planning. Our experiments show that RynnVLA-002 surpasses individual VLA and world models, demonstrating their mutual enhancement. We evaluate RynnVLA-002 in both simulation and real-world robot tasks. RynnVLA-002 achieves 97.4% success rate on the LIBERO simulation benchmark without pretraining, while in real-world LeRobot experiments, its integrated world model boosts the overall success rate by 50%.

TL;DR: 研究发现视觉创造力存在明显梯度：视觉艺术家最具创造力，其次是非艺术家，然后是受人类启发的生成AI，最后是自主引导的生成AI。人类指导显著提升AI的创造力输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在发散思维任务中已能匹配人类创造力，但视觉创造力领域仍待探索，特别是比较人类与AI在图像生成中的创造力表现。

Method: 比较人类参与者（视觉艺术家和非艺术家）与图像生成AI模型（两种提示条件：高人类输入的受人类启发和低人类输入的自主引导）的图像生成能力，由255名人类评分者和GPT4o评估图像创造力。

Result: 发现清晰的创造力梯度，人类指导显著改善生成AI的创造力输出，使其接近非艺术家水平。人类和AI评分者在创造力判断模式上存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 与语言中心任务不同，生成AI在视觉领域面临独特挑战，因为视觉创造力依赖于感知细微差别和上下文敏感性，这些是人类特有的能力，可能难以从语言模型直接迁移。

Abstract: While recent research suggests Large Language Models match human creative performance in divergent thinking tasks, visual creativity remains underexplored. This study compared image generation in human participants (Visual Artists and Non Artists) and using an image generation AI model (two prompting conditions with varying human input: high for Human Inspired, low for Self Guided). Human raters (N=255) and GPT4o evaluated the creativity of the resulting images. We found a clear creativity gradient, with Visual Artists being the most creative, followed by Non Artists, then Human Inspired generative AI, and finally Self Guided generative AI. Increased human guidance strongly improved GenAI's creative output, bringing its productions close to those of Non Artists. Notably, human and AI raters also showed vastly different creativity judgment patterns. These results suggest that, in contrast to language centered tasks, GenAI models may face unique challenges in visual domains, where creativity depends on perceptual nuance and contextual sensitivity, distinctly human capacities that may not be readily transferable from language models.

TL;DR: Cognitive BASIC是一种基于BASIC风格的最小化提示语言和模型内解释器，将大语言模型的推理结构化为显式的逐步执行轨迹，实现透明的多步推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受复古BASIC简单性的启发，重新利用编号行和简单命令作为可解释的认知控制层，使现代LLM能够可靠地模拟这类简短程序。

Method: 使用自然语言解释器文件指定命令语义、内存更新和日志行为，通过心理模型解释器提取声明性和程序性知识，检测矛盾并在必要时产生解决方案。

Result: 在三个LLM上对知识提取、冲突检测和推理任务的基准测试表明，所有模型都能执行Cognitive BASIC程序，整体性能强劲但不均匀。

Conclusion: Cognitive BASIC为LLM推理提供了一种结构化的、可解释的方法，使多步推理过程更加透明和可靠。

Abstract: Cognitive BASIC is a minimal, BASIC-style prompting language and in-model interpreter that structures large language model (LLM) reasoning into explicit, stepwise execution traces. Inspired by the simplicity of retro BASIC, we repurpose numbered lines and simple commands as an interpretable cognitive control layer. Modern LLMs can reliably simulate such short programs, enabling transparent multi-step reasoning inside the model. A natural-language interpreter file specifies command semantics, memory updates, and logging behavior. Our mental-model interpreter extracts declarative and procedural knowledge, detects contradictions, and produces resolutions when necessary. A comparison across three LLMs on a benchmark of knowledge extraction, conflict detection, and reasoning tasks shows that all models can execute Cognitive BASIC programs, with overall strong but not uniform performance.

Motivation: 基准测试对AI发展至关重要，但无效问题会削弱其可靠性。手动识别和修正数千个基准问题不可行，成为可靠评估的关键瓶颈。

Method: 基于AI评估中常用的核心假设——均值分数足以概括模型性能，构建统计分析方法，当项目统计值超出预期范围时标记为潜在问题，并结合LLM初审减少人工工作量。

Result: 在九个广泛使用的基准测试中，该方法指导专家审查识别问题问题的精度高达84%。

Conclusion: 该框架为系统基准修订提供了高效可扩展的解决方案，结合统计分析和LLM初审显著减少了人工工作量。

Abstract: Benchmarks are pivotal in driving AI progress, and invalid benchmark questions frequently undermine their reliability. Manually identifying and correcting errors among thousands of benchmark questions is not only infeasible but also a critical bottleneck for reliable evaluation. In this work, we introduce a framework for systematic benchmark revision that leverages statistical analysis of response patterns to flag potentially invalid questions for further expert review. Our approach builds on a core assumption commonly used in AI evaluations that the mean score sufficiently summarizes model performance. This implies a unidimensional latent construct underlying the measurement experiment, yielding expected ranges for various statistics for each item. When empirically estimated values for these statistics fall outside the expected range for an item, the item is more likely to be problematic. Across nine widely used benchmarks, our method guides expert review to identify problematic questions with up to 84\% precision. In addition, we introduce an LLM-judge first pass to review questions, further reducing human effort. Together, these components provide an efficient and scalable framework for systematic benchmark revision.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种混合差分奖励机制来解决多车辆协同驾驶中传统状态奖励函数存在的奖励差异消失问题，通过整合时间差分奖励和动作梯度奖励来提高策略梯度的信噪比，从而改善算法收敛性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多车辆协同驾驶任务中，传统基于状态的奖励函数存在奖励差异消失的问题，导致策略梯度的信噪比低，严重阻碍算法收敛和性能提升。

Method: 提出混合差分奖励机制，包含两个互补组件：基于全局势函数的时间差分奖励和直接测量动作边际效用的动作梯度奖励。将协同驾驶问题建模为具有时变智能体集的多智能体部分可观测马尔可夫博弈。

Result: 通过在线规划和多智能体强化学习算法的广泛实验表明，HDR机制显著提高了收敛速度和策略稳定性，引导智能体学习到能够有效平衡交通效率和安全的优质协同策略。

Conclusion: HDR机制成功解决了多车辆协同驾驶中的奖励信号问题，为高频率连续控制任务提供了有效的奖励设计框架。

Abstract: In multi-vehicle cooperative driving tasks involving high-frequency continuous control, traditional state-based reward functions suffer from the issue of vanishing reward differences. This phenomenon results in a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for policy gradients, significantly hindering algorithm convergence and performance improvement. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel Hybrid Differential Reward (HDR) mechanism. We first theoretically elucidate how the temporal quasi-steady nature of traffic states and the physical proximity of actions lead to the failure of traditional reward signals. Building on this analysis, the HDR framework innovatively integrates two complementary components: (1) a Temporal Difference Reward (TRD) based on a global potential function, which utilizes the evolutionary trend of potential energy to ensure optimal policy invariance and consistency with long-term objectives; and (2) an Action Gradient Reward (ARG), which directly measures the marginal utility of actions to provide a local guidance signal with a high SNR. Furthermore, we formulate the cooperative driving problem as a Multi-Agent Partially Observable Markov Game (POMDPG) with a time-varying agent set and provide a complete instantiation scheme for HDR within this framework. Extensive experiments conducted using both online planning (MCTS) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (QMIX, MAPPO, MADDPG) algorithms demonstrate that the HDR mechanism significantly improves convergence speed and policy stability. The results confirm that HDR guides agents to learn high-quality cooperative policies that effectively balance traffic efficiency and safety.

Motivation: 尽管贝叶斯网络被认为是透明模型，但用户仍难以理解其推理过程，现有用户界面未能有效澄清贝叶斯网络的推理机制。

Method: 设计了语言和视觉扩展来增强标准贝叶斯网络用户界面，通过用户研究比较了语言扩展、视觉扩展、组合扩展和基线界面的效果。

Result: 用户在使用三种扩展界面时，在观察影响、影响路径以及观察间相互影响等问题上的表现均优于基线界面；语言和视觉模式结合在某些问题类型上优于单独使用任一模式。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯网络界面的语言和视觉扩展能有效提升用户对推理过程的理解，多模态结合的方式在某些场景下具有优势。

Abstract: Bayesian Networks (BNs) are an important tool for assisting probabilistic reasoning, but despite being considered transparent models, people have trouble understanding them. Further, current User Interfaces (UIs) still do not clarify the reasoning of BNs. To address this problem, we have designed verbal and visual extensions to the standard BN UI, which can guide users through common inference patterns.
  We conducted a user study to compare our verbal, visual and combined UI extensions, and a baseline UI. Our main findings are: (1) users did better with all three types of extensions than with the baseline UI for questions about the impact of an observation, the paths that enable this impact, and the way in which an observation influences the impact of other observations; and (2) using verbal and visual modalities together is better than using either modality alone for some of these question types.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI科学家方法将科学发现视为孤立优化过程，忽略了知识生产的社会性和历史性。人类科学洞察来自个体认知轨迹和集体学科记忆两个相互关联的来源。

Method: 提出三层架构：个体层构建研究者的认知模型（情景、语义、人格记忆）；领域层将集体知识映射为学科概念图；跨学科层作为正交编排引擎。架构分离记忆存储与智能执行。

Result: 在四个综合任务中评估：作者级认知模拟、互补推理、跨学科协作促进、多智能体科学问题解决。结果显示MirrorMind超越了简单事实检索，实现了结构化、个性化和洞察生成的科学推理。

Conclusion: 通过整合个体认知深度与集体学科广度，MirrorMind能够实现更具结构性和洞察力的科学推理，推动AI科学家向更真实的科学发现过程发展。

Abstract: The emergence of AI Scientists has demonstrated remarkable potential in automating scientific research. However, current approaches largely conceptualize scientific discovery as a solitary optimization or search process, overlooking that knowledge production is inherently a social and historical endeavor. Human scientific insight stems from two distinct yet interconnected sources. First is the individual cognitive trajectory, where a researcher's unique insight is shaped by their evolving research history and stylistic preferences; another is the collective disciplinary memory, where knowledge is sedimented into vast, interconnected networks of citations and concepts. Existing LLMs still struggle to represent these structured, high-fidelity cognitive and social contexts. To bridge this gap, we introduce MirrorMind, a hierarchical cognitive architecture that integrates dual-memory representations within a three-level framework. The Individual Level constructs high-fidelity cognitive models of individual researchers by capturing their episodic, semantic, and persona memories; the Domain Level maps collective knowledge into structured disciplinary concept graphs; and the Interdisciplinary Level that acts as an orthogonal orchestration engine. Crucially, our architecture separates memory storage from agentic execution, enabling AI scientist agents to flexibly access individual memories for unique perspectives or collective structures to reason. We evaluate MirrorMind across four comprehensive tasks, including author-level cognitive simulation, complementary reasoning, cross-disciplinary collaboration promotion, and multi-agent scientific problem solving. The results show that by integrating individual cognitive depth with collective disciplinary breadth, MirrorMind moves beyond simple fact retrieval toward structural, personalized, and insight-generating scientific reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具增强智能体在增加工具调用预算时缺乏预算意识，导致性能很快达到瓶颈。需要研究如何在预算约束下有效扩展智能体能力。

Method: 提出预算跟踪器插件提供持续预算意识，并开发BATS框架，利用预算意识动态调整规划和验证策略，决定是深入挖掘有希望的线索还是转向新路径。

Result: 预算感知方法产生更有利的扩展曲线，推动了成本-性能的帕累托边界，提供了对工具增强智能体扩展的更透明和原则性理解。

Conclusion: 通过赋予智能体预算意识并开发动态策略调整框架，可以有效扩展工具增强智能体在预算约束下的性能，为智能体扩展提供了新的实证见解。

Abstract: Scaling test-time computation improves performance across different tasks on large language models (LLMs), which has also been extended to tool-augmented agents. For these agents, scaling involves not only "thinking" in tokens but also "acting" via tool calls. The number of tool calls directly bounds the agent's interaction with the external environment. However, we find that simply granting agents a larger tool-call budget fails to improve performance, as they lack "budget awareness" and quickly hit a performance ceiling. To address this, we study how to scale such agents effectively under explicit tool-call budgets, focusing on web search agents. We first introduce the Budget Tracker, a lightweight plug-in that provides the agent with continuous budget awareness, enabling simple yet effective scaling. We further develop BATS (Budget Aware Test-time Scaling), an advanced framework that leverages this awareness to dynamically adapt its planning and verification strategy, deciding whether to "dig deeper" on a promising lead or "pivot" to new paths based on remaining resources. To analyze cost-performance scaling in a controlled manner, we formalize a unified cost metric that jointly accounts for token and tool consumption. We provide the first systematic study on budget-constrained agents, showing that budget-aware methods produce more favorable scaling curves and push the cost-performance Pareto frontier. Our work offers empirical insights toward a more transparent and principled understanding of scaling in tool-augmented agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统贝叶斯视角下基于分数的扩散方法在解决逆问题时，先验提供的指导有限，重建主要受测量一致性项驱动，导致推理过程与扩散动力学实际解耦。需要澄清这种结构并改进方法。

Method: 将扩散重新解释为EM框架中的初始化阶段，完全解耦扩散阶段和数据驱动优化。引入DAPS++方法，让似然项更直接地指导推理，同时保持数值稳定性。

Result: DAPS++需要更少的函数评估次数和测量优化步骤，在多种图像恢复任务中实现了高计算效率和鲁棒的重建性能。

Conclusion: 通过将扩散视为EM框架中的初始化阶段并解耦优化过程，DAPS++提供了对统一扩散轨迹有效性的新理解，同时显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: From a Bayesian perspective, score-based diffusion solves inverse problems through joint inference, embedding the likelihood with the prior to guide the sampling process. However, this formulation fails to explain its practical behavior: the prior offers limited guidance, while reconstruction is largely driven by the measurement-consistency term, leading to an inference process that is effectively decoupled from the diffusion dynamics. To clarify this structure, we reinterpret the role of diffusion in inverse problem solving as an initialization stage within an expectation--maximization (EM)--style framework, where the diffusion stage and the data-driven refinement are fully decoupled. We introduce \textbf{DAPS++}, which allows the likelihood term to guide inference more directly while maintaining numerical stability and providing insight into why unified diffusion trajectories remain effective in practice. By requiring fewer function evaluations (NFEs) and measurement-optimization steps, \textbf{DAPS++} achieves high computational efficiency and robust reconstruction performance across diverse image restoration tasks.

Motivation: 电子健康记录中既有结构化信息（诊断代码、药物、实验室结果）也有非结构化文本（出院总结、护理记录），需要整合这两种数据源来构建透明的临床决策支持系统。

Method: 使用专家指导的贝叶斯网络处理结构化EHR特征，使用神经网络文本分类器处理临床笔记，通过虚拟证据和一致性节点进行概率融合。

Result: 在SimSUM模拟数据集上验证了方法的有效性，一致性节点相比单独使用虚拟证据能改善预测校准，使贝叶斯网络能更好地处理缺失信息和解决数据矛盾。

Conclusion: 提出的多模态融合方法能够有效整合结构化EHR数据和临床文本，提供可解释的概率预测，改善临床决策支持系统的性能。

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) form an invaluable resource for training clinical decision support systems. To leverage the potential of such systems in high-risk applications, we need large, structured tabular datasets on which we can build transparent feature-based models. While part of the EHR already contains structured information (e.g. diagnosis codes, medications, and lab results), much of the information is contained within unstructured text (e.g. discharge summaries and nursing notes). In this work, we propose a method for multi-modal patient-level information extraction that leverages both the tabular features available in the patient's EHR (using an expert-informed Bayesian network) as well as clinical notes describing the patient's symptoms (using neural text classifiers). We propose the use of virtual evidence augmented with a consistency node to provide an interpretable, probabilistic fusion of the models' predictions. The consistency node improves the calibration of the final predictions compared to virtual evidence alone, allowing the Bayesian network to better adjust the neural classifier's output to handle missing information and resolve contradictions between the tabular and text data. We show the potential of our method on the SimSUM dataset, a simulated benchmark linking tabular EHRs with clinical notes through expert knowledge.

Motivation: BDI模型是人工智能和认知科学中表示理性智能体的基石，但其与结构化、语义可互操作知识表示的集成仍然有限。需要开发一个形式化的BDI本体来弥补这一差距。

Method: 设计了一个模块化的BDI本体模式，与基础本体对齐以确保语义精确性和可重用性。通过两个实验验证：1) 与LLMs结合使用逻辑增强生成；2) 在Semas推理平台中集成，实现T2B2T范式。

Conclusion: BDI本体为构建认知基础、可解释且语义可互操作的多智能体和神经符号系统提供了有效工具，在数据网络中架起了声明性与程序性智能之间的桥梁。

Abstract: The Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) model is a cornerstone for representing rational agency in artificial intelligence and cognitive sciences. Yet, its integration into structured, semantically interoperable knowledge representations remains limited. This paper presents a formal BDI Ontology, conceived as a modular Ontology Design Pattern (ODP) that captures the cognitive architecture of agents through beliefs, desires, intentions, and their dynamic interrelations. The ontology ensures semantic precision and reusability by aligning with foundational ontologies and best practices in modular design. Two complementary lines of experimentation demonstrate its applicability: (i) coupling the ontology with Large Language Models (LLMs) via Logic Augmented Generation (LAG) to assess the contribution of ontological grounding to inferential coherence and consistency; and (ii) integrating the ontology within the Semas reasoning platform, which implements the Triples-to-Beliefs-to-Triples (T2B2T) paradigm, enabling a bidirectional flow between RDF triples and agent mental states. Together, these experiments illustrate how the BDI Ontology acts as both a conceptual and operational bridge between declarative and procedural intelligence, paving the way for cognitively grounded, explainable, and semantically interoperable multi-agent and neuro-symbolic systems operating within the Web of Data.

*Kesheng Chen,Wenjian Luo,Bang Zhang,Zeping Yin,Zipeng Ye*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为MIR的简单而有效的增强策略，用于解决多智能体强化学习中极其稀疏奖励（如情节奖励）的问题，通过激励智能体探索影响队友的行动来改善团队探索和算法性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 情节奖励在强化学习中是一个重大挑战。虽然内在奖励方法在单智能体强化学习中已证明有效，但在多智能体强化学习（MARL）中的应用仍存在问题。主要困难来自两个方面：（1）随着探索空间的扩展，导致奖励的联合行动轨迹呈指数级稀疏；（2）现有方法往往未能考虑可以影响团队状态的联合行动。

Method: 本文引入了相互内在奖励（MIR），这是一种简单而有效的MARL增强策略。MIR激励个体智能体探索影响其队友的行动，当与原始策略结合时，能有效刺激团队探索并提高算法性能。为了全面实验验证，作者扩展了代表性的单智能体MiniGrid环境，创建了MiniGrid-MA系列MARL环境。

Result: 在MiniGrid-MA设置中，将所提出的方法与最先进的方法进行比较，实验结果表明该方法具有优越的性能。

Conclusion: MIR方法有效解决了MARL中稀疏奖励的问题，通过激励智能体间的相互影响探索，显著提升了团队探索效率和算法性能。

Abstract: Episodic rewards present a significant challenge in reinforcement learning. While intrinsic reward methods have demonstrated effectiveness in single-agent rein-forcement learning scenarios, their application to multi-agent reinforcement learn-ing (MARL) remains problematic. The primary difficulties stem from two fac-tors: (1) the exponential sparsity of joint action trajectories that lead to rewards as the exploration space expands, and (2) existing methods often fail to account for joint actions that can influence team states. To address these challenges, this paper introduces Mutual Intrinsic Reward (MIR), a simple yet effective enhancement strategy for MARL with extremely sparse rewards like episodic rewards. MIR incentivizes individual agents to explore actions that affect their teammates, and when combined with original strategies, effectively stimulates team exploration and improves algorithm performance. For comprehensive experimental valida-tion, we extend the representative single-agent MiniGrid environment to create MiniGrid-MA, a series of MARL environments with sparse rewards. Our evalu-ation compares the proposed method against state-of-the-art approaches in the MiniGrid-MA setting, with experimental results demonstrating superior perfor-mance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用LLM驱动智能体（如ReAct或角色扮演）在需要严格结构化工作流程的专业领域表现不佳，特别是在遥感等需要专业工具和多步骤程序的领域。

Method: 引入分层任务抽象机制（HTAM），将多智能体系统构建为反映领域内在任务依赖关系的逻辑层次结构，将复杂问题分解为顺序层，每层子智能体在前一层输出上操作。

Result: 在GeoPlan-bench基准测试中，EarthAgent在工具选择、路径相似性和逻辑完整性方面显著优于现有单智能体和多智能体系统。

Conclusion: 将智能体架构与领域内在任务结构对齐是构建强大可靠的专业自主系统的关键步骤。

Abstract: LLM-driven agents, particularly those using general frameworks like ReAct or human-inspired role-playing, often struggle in specialized domains that necessitate rigorously structured workflows. Fields such as remote sensing, requiring specialized tools (e.g., correction, spectral indices calculation), and multi-step procedures (e.g., numerous intermediate products and optional steps), significantly challenge generalized approaches. To address this gap, we introduce a novel agent design framework centered on a Hierarchical Task Abstraction Mechanism (HTAM). Specifically, HTAM moves beyond emulating social roles, instead structuring multi-agent systems into a logical hierarchy that mirrors the intrinsic task-dependency graph of a given domain. This task-centric architecture thus enforces procedural correctness and decomposes complex problems into sequential layers, where each layer's sub-agents operate on the outputs of the preceding layers. We instantiate this framework as EarthAgent, a multi-agent system tailored for complex geospatial analysis. To evaluate such complex planning capabilities, we build GeoPlan-bench, a comprehensive benchmark of realistic, multi-step geospatial planning tasks. It is accompanied by a suite of carefully designed metrics to evaluate tool selection, path similarity, and logical completeness. Experiments show that EarthAgent substantially outperforms a range of established single- and multi-agent systems. Our work demonstrates that aligning agent architecture with a domain's intrinsic task structure is a critical step toward building robust and reliable specialized autonomous systems.

Abstract: Agentic AI seeks to endow systems with sustained autonomy, reasoning, and interaction capabilities. To realize this vision, its assumptions about agency must be complemented by explicit models of cognition, cooperation, and governance. This paper argues that the conceptual tools developed within the Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS) community, such as BDI architectures, communication protocols, mechanism design, and institutional modelling, provide precisely such a foundation. By aligning adaptive, data-driven approaches with structured models of reasoning and coordination, we outline a path toward agentic systems that are not only capable and flexible, but also transparent, cooperative, and accountable. The result is a perspective on agency that bridges formal theory and practical autonomy.

TL;DR: 评估使用合成和离策略数据对LLM行为探测泛化能力的影响，发现数据生成策略显著影响探测性能，且同领域离策略数据比不同领域策略内数据更可靠


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于许多LLM行为的自然样本稀少，研究者不得不依赖合成或离策略的LLM响应来训练探测模型，需要系统评估这种数据选择对探测泛化能力的影响

Method: 在8种不同LLM行为上测试线性和注意力探测模型，比较不同响应生成策略对探测性能的影响，分析从离策略数据到策略内数据的泛化能力

Result: 响应生成策略显著影响探测性能，成功从离策略数据泛化到策略内数据的能力可以预测真实场景中的泛化表现，欺骗和伪装探测可能在实际监控中泛化失败

Conclusion: 在没有策略内数据时，使用同领域离策略数据比使用不同领域策略内数据产生更可靠的探测，强调需要更好处理LLM监控中分布偏移的方法

Abstract: Probing has emerged as a promising method for monitoring Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling inference-time detection of concerning behaviours such as deception and sycophancy. However, natural examples of many behaviours are rare, forcing researchers to rely on synthetic or off-policy LLM responses for training probes. We systematically evaluate how the use of synthetic and off-policy data influences probe generalisation across eight distinct LLM behaviours. Testing linear and attention probes across multiple LLMs, we find that the response generation strategy can significantly affect probe performance, though the magnitude of this effect varies by behaviour. We find that successful generalisation from off-policy data, to test sets where the model is incentivised to produce the target behaviour, is predictive of successful on-policy generalisation. Leveraging this result, we predict that Deception and Sandbagging probes may fail to generalise from off-policy to on-policy data when used in real monitoring scenarios. Notably, shifts in the training data domain still cause even larger performance degradation, with different-domain test scores being consistently lower than the same-domain ones. These results indicate that, in the absence of on-policy data, using same-domain off-policy data yields more reliable probes than using on-policy data from a different domain, emphasizing the need for methods that can better handle distribution shifts in LLM monitoring.

Conclusion: SRA-CP框架能有效解决协作感知中的通信带宽和动态环境适应性问题，实现高效的风险感知选择性协作

Abstract: Cooperative perception (CP) offers significant potential to overcome the limitations of single-vehicle sensing by enabling information sharing among connected vehicles (CVs). However, existing generic CP approaches need to transmit large volumes of perception data that are irrelevant to the driving safety, exceeding available communication bandwidth. Moreover, most CP frameworks rely on pre-defined communication partners, making them unsuitable for dynamic traffic environments. This paper proposes a Spontaneous Risk-Aware Selective Cooperative Perception (SRA-CP) framework to address these challenges. SRA-CP introduces a decentralized protocol where connected agents continuously broadcast lightweight perception coverage summaries and initiate targeted cooperation only when risk-relevant blind zones are detected. A perceptual risk identification module enables each CV to locally assess the impact of occlusions on its driving task and determine whether cooperation is necessary. When CP is triggered, the ego vehicle selects appropriate peers based on shared perception coverage and engages in selective information exchange through a fusion module that prioritizes safety-critical content and adapts to bandwidth constraints. We evaluate SRA-CP on a public dataset against several representative baselines. Results show that SRA-CP achieves less than 1% average precision (AP) loss for safety-critical objects compared to generic CP, while using only 20% of the communication bandwidth. Moreover, it improves the perception performance by 15% over existing selective CP methods that do not incorporate risk awareness.

TL;DR: PhysMorph-GS通过可微分材料点法(MPM)与3D高斯泼溅的耦合，解决了物理模拟中表面提取不可微分导致的"渲染鸿沟"问题，实现了从图像空间监督的逆向设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有物理模拟方法存在"渲染鸿沟"：不可微分的表面提取阻止了图像损失直接指导物理优化，需要一种能够将稀疏粒子状态映射到密集高斯表示的可微分桥梁。

Method: 提出可微分MPM与3D高斯泼溅的耦合方法，通过变形感知上采样桥梁将稀疏粒子状态(x,F)映射到密集高斯(mu,Sigma)；采用多模态渲染损失和两路径反向传播，通过多通道交错优化方案避免纯物理驱动解的崩溃。

Result: 在挑战性变形序列上，PhysMorph-GS相比可微分MPM基线提高了边界保真度和时间稳定性，更好地重建了耳朵和尾巴等薄结构；深度监督变体将Chamfer距离降低了约2.5%。

Conclusion: PhysMorph-GS通过提供可微分粒子到高斯的桥梁，填补了物理感知渲染管道的关键空白，实现了直接从图像空间监督的逆向设计。

Abstract: Shape morphing with physics-based simulation naturally supports large deformations and topology changes, but existing methods suffer from a "rendering gap": nondifferentiable surface extraction prevents image losses from directly guiding physics optimization. We introduce PhysMorph-GS, which couples a differentiable material point method (MPM) with 3D Gaussian splatting through a deformation-aware upsampling bridge that maps sparse particle states (x, F) to dense Gaussians (mu, Sigma). Multi-modal rendering losses on silhouette and depth backpropagate along two paths, from covariances to deformation gradients via a stretch-based mapping and from Gaussian means to particle positions. Through the MPM adjoint, these gradients update deformation controls while mass is conserved at a compact set of anchor particles. A multi-pass interleaved optimization scheme repeatedly injects rendering gradients into successive physics steps, avoiding collapse to purely physics-driven solutions. On challenging morphing sequences, PhysMorph-GS improves boundary fidelity and temporal stability over a differentiable MPM baseline and better reconstructs thin structures such as ears and tails. Quantitatively, our depth-supervised variant reduces Chamfer distance by about 2.5 percent relative to the physics-only baseline. By providing a differentiable particle-to-Gaussian bridge, PhysMorph-GS closes a key gap in physics-aware rendering pipelines and enables inverse design directly from image-space supervision.
